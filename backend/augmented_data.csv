I admit I haven't kept up with all the post-book updates in the Harry Potter universe. I'd love to reread the series in the future with new information interspersed via footnotes or commentary! What do you think?
"Including new information within the main narrative might disrupt the story's flow. Perhaps an appendix with family trees and Pottermore details, similar to Tolkien's approach, would work better."
"It’s fascinating how this passage foreshadows Dumbledore's evolving storyline. Initially seen as perfect, Harry soon learns of Dumbledore's human flaws and complex past, which adds depth to his character."
"Be warned, spoilers ahead! The books reveal intricate details about Dumbledore's secretive nature and his plans involving Harry. Dumbledore's secrecy often frustrated Harry, but ultimately, Harry understood the greater purpose behind it all."
"Discovering James Potter's bullying past troubled Harry deeply. In ""Order of the Phoenix,"" he seeks more information about his father's actions, leading to a more nuanced understanding of James as a flawed but good-hearted man."
"Sirius gave Harry a pair of two-way mirrors in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" which Harry forgot about. After Sirius's death, Harry found the mirror again, leading to significant events involving Aberforth and Dobby."
"Snape's love for Lily Potter was profound and enduring. Despite their estrangement, Snape's feelings stayed strong, influencing his actions and his allegiance to protect Harry, guided by his love for Lily."
"Foreshadowing abounds in ""Order of the Phoenix."" Dumbledore's reaction to the smoke serpent hints at his suspicion that a part of Voldemort's soul resides in Harry, a pivotal revelation in the series."

"I haven’t been able to keep up with all the new HP lore, but rereading the series with the latest updates would be an exciting and insightful journey."
Adding tons of new info directly into the narrative might be jarring. Separate sections or end-of-book appendices would preserve the story’s flow while providing additional context.
