i do nt think he necessarily knows that has any connection to luke though pretty sure he just interprets it as rey s own internalization of her isolation and loneliness in her dreams she probably does too  because i m assuming she was having those dreams before she even heard that luke and the jedi actually exist ,d02qghe,starwars,entertainment,1455676863.0,p3wp3wkachu,4.0,0.0,1,242,0.0
both times i saw it  it seemed to me that meant that she had been on the island with him before  as a child for that to be true would mean that luke was nt  hunting  for the island  but already knew where it was i m fine with that logic for now  since he may have wanted to keep it a secret wow  maybe he found her there ,d02skyc,starwars,entertainment,1455680304.0,Friendly_B,1.0,0.0,234,2865,0.0

cant  agree with anyone here who wants luke to just use the force and not get involved in any lightsaber battles i totally want to see luke wield that green lightsaber again and go full retard on his enemies like he did in rotj but having said that  i also do nt want him to wield two lightsabers like the op does i do nt want anyone to wield two i do nt subscribe to that whole more is better  philosophy it just looks stupid to me  not badass ,d02j7bv,starwars,entertainment,1455665634.0,ConvolutedUsername,2.0,0.0,70,4312,0.0

yeah  that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke  and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh  i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides  are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen ,d02b0zt,starwars,entertainment,1455654296.0,niccinco,13.0,0.0,671,20964,0.0
not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep 8 or even 9  where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training  but when she completes her own saber  it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle involving rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors ,4637t7,starwars,entertainment,1455640261.0,prooveit1701,50.0,0.0,1,4317,0.0

i hope that rey has a decent amount of training and her own lightsaber already built by the start of episode 8  preferably a doublebladed one as a nod to her staff a fight with rey and luke back to back against the knights of ren led by kylo would be sick if it happens i hope they have a confident kylo and his knights do some badass stuff to signify his progression and vindicate the  little bitch  rep he kind of has that would be some good character development,d021kuh,starwars,entertainment,1455641458.0,durtyc,45.0,0.0,1,235,0.0

i think snoke simply corrupted a young impressionable ben the dark side is the quick  easy  and attractive path it s supposed to be tempting and i hope that they use the explanation of ben s fall to add to snoke s development as a formidable and manipulative figure  anakin s the only skywalker to fall like ben has fallen and he had a mentor pushing him down that path the whole way i think ben will turn out to be the same way they can add a catalyst for the fall but i d like it to be mostly snoke we need more snoke,d02bocj,starwars,entertainment,1455655129.0,durtyc,3.0,0.0,1,235,0.0

i would have replaced maz with leia and had her give some explanation of the force to rey something similar to the yoda line about  it flows through us binds us  feel it luminance beings are we not this  so that rey had at least some explanation for how she all of the sudden knew how to tap into it for the first time in her life i can see leia being hans connection to the resistance that he s reluctant to contact working out pretty well and feel like it would be a cool role for her  i go back and forth on this one but i would have had kylo ren take his helmet off for the first time on the catwalk with han i also would have given him a different haircut  i thought the curls made him less intimidating  also i would have had the resistance send bigger ships to starkiller base to help get the xwings through the fo fleet they would nt have to show a big capital ship battle scene or anything but it would have made the resistance actually look like they were being funded by a legitimate government  would have distanced that battle from the first death star a little and made more sense to me personally ,d0235oc,starwars,entertainment,1455643678.0,durtyc,19.0,0.0,1,235,0.0

i m pretty sure dooku was very strong in both the force and in saber combat just looking at the movies  basically the holy scripture of canon   he was able to defeat obiwan  who we should remember was not a shabby duelist himself  and an immature anakin 2v1 he was then able to hold his own against yoda for an extended period of time later  he defeated obiwan again before eventually falling to anakin  he also received direct training by the two greatest force users of his time  yoda and palpatine ,d0274uq,starwars,entertainment,1455649074.0,XYZ-Wing,11.0,0.0,1,4387,0.0

 this is not the update that i had hoped to write  but i am here to let you know that star wars fan paul giesbrecht  whom i posted about before  passed away this valentine s day after a long battle with cancer   original post   https  wwwredditcomrstarwarscomments35bvlnstar_wars_fan_dying_of_cancer_four_young_men_that   first update   https  wwwredditcomrstarwarscomments35houzupdate_star_wars_fan_dying_of_cancer_update_thank   second update   https  wwwredditcomrstarwarscomments3m075aupdate_2_star_wars_fan_dying_of_cancer_wanted_to  in previous posts  i talked about how paul had been doing since reddit raised about  4000 to go toward his family s expenses a lot has happened since then  paul was even contacted by lucasfilm and jj abrams  who offered their encouragement it was a bigger response than they could have hoped for paul and his wife were able to see the force awakens and had a great time going thank you so much to all of you who have supported them  since that time paul took a turn for the worse a blockage appeared in his intestine and he became unable to eat  first the plain foods he had been subsisting on  then the protein and meal replacement shakes became impossible for him to digest the combination of the cancer and the inability to eat led to him losing tremendous amounts of weight and being hospitalized things looked very bleak  and they opted for a surgery to clear the blockage  as risky as it was  there was no other option  while paul came through the surgery and was able to start eating again  the hopedfor weight gain and return to a better level of strength did not materialize he was eating and not putting the weight back on  and he continued to lose strength the doctors told him there were no more medical options  however they were not willing to give up  they had heard about an alternative treatment center in germany that reported having success with his type of cancer they knew it was a long shot  but were going to give it everything they ve got  it was essentially the last ditch effort at treatment there is available  they fundraised in their local community and managed to raise the money to go  i was preparing to post a request for assistance online again  but they actually raised the money more quickly than expected paul left for the sixweek treatment program with high spirits  we even had a going away party for him with a big banner that read   never tell me the odds  which the whole town got together and signed it was a blast  sadly  it was a going away party in more ways than one only a week into his sixweek program the doctors learned that his kidneys and liver were shutting down he was immediately booked for a flight home because they believed he would soon not be well enough to travel they were right  only seven days after arriving home  paul slipped into a coma and passed away two days later  his funeral is this friday  so keep his family in your thoughts at that time if you can his  obituary   http  passageswinnipegfreepresscompassagedetailsid232737namepaul_giesbrechtminrundate1455602400orderpublish_date  desclast_name  asc  can be seen online  paul spoke so highly of the star wars community here at reddit  he and his wife read each and every message they received  and we know for a fact it was the high volume of emails lucasfilm got about paul that had them get into contact with him and his family hearing from jj was a big highlight for them he was offered an early screening but turned it down as he was feeling well enough to go to the theater and did nt want to miss the experience  but the fact that they offered was enough  i m trying to think of something to do to help his family now  to help with their expenses or his boys  education the guys who made the original video are interested in doing something else  perhaps  so i will keep you posted we may need some help to get support if we try and raise some funds for his family  thanks again may the force be with you ,465jjx,starwars,entertainment,1455669327.0,Transcendatron,74.0,0.0,7839,8018,0.0

hello everyone  with ep viii filming information hitting now  the mods have decided to put it to a vote on what we do with the policy     here are your options     keep everything as is until dvdbluray release  every spoiler about tfa is fair game except  the big one  which will still need to be marked in comments and wo nt be allowed in titles  everything spoiler about tfa is fair game   please vote here   http  strawpollme6824332   if you ve got another option you think is better than these three feel free to comment ,45z963,starwars,entertainment,1455575991.0,SimplTrixAndNonsense,46.0,0.0,347,2984,1.0
i truly think it s about time all tfa info is open without spoiler tagging anymore it s been two whole months since it came out and even in china  one of the last countries to get it  it opened a month ago  what i think needs to be reinforced are the r1 and viii spoiler policies  especially in titles more and more information will begin to come out in the near future and even if it seems irrelevant to some  others might not want to know about it until they watch the movie  s   minor things i do nt really care but i know some folks do so better to be safe about it imo ,d01bv62,starwars,entertainment,1455584286.0,Karl_Agathon,11.0,0.0,10288,11166,0.0

now what about the issue of banning for tagged spoilers in nonflaired threads  it s definitely too harsh  though i understand it s about mobile app users maybe instead of banning that person mods could simply flair the thread andor warn the user about the rule ,d016zwg,starwars,entertainment,1455576515.0,fifthdayofmay,7.0,0.0,85040,14718,0.0
i think its time to just let the policy go its your fault if you browse a star wars forum and you have nt seen it yet it took me 2 weeks to see the movie  but i did nt browse this sub because i knew it would have spoilers ,d01lmp8,starwars,entertainment,1455600482.0,dfeld17,3.0,0.0,416,10944,0.0
seems most fair to everyone in this subreddit to unspoiler everything about tfa except that    s  han solo dies   since this  is  a star wars specific subreddit the only reason we should hide the mentioned spoiler is our content can spill into rall and it is a substantial event near the climax of the movie  i also like what was said in another post about malicious spoilers ,d01al2v,starwars,entertainment,1455582212.0,cyborgcommando0,-1.0,0.0,63181,66452,1.0

instead of waiting around for episode 8 to come out  i came up with my own ideas  the movie begins with supreme leader snoke viciously training kylo ren kylo takes on 15 stormtroopers and wins we are introduced to the knights of ren that  like vader in episode 3  crave the powers of immortality and ressurection there is syma ren  the last clone produced for the clone wars he never got to fight due to the war s end  and he was left with a short lifespan due to his being a clone the kaminoans tried to increase his life span  but eventually syma ren just slaughtered them all and created a suit that keeps him alive before becoming a knight of ren the other knights are nala ren  a former bounty hunter with a scoundrel personality and nothing better to do  nexo ren  a mad scientist with an unpredictable personality  and rexus ren  a mandalorian who craves war so much  he wants to fight forever and  in case he kills everybody  ressurect his enemies they are preparing to attack luke since rey used the millenium falcon  which is easily trackable  the reason the force awakens gave for han solo and the gangs tracking down the millenium falcon and also why they went to takodana in the first place in order to get a new ship   we cut back to rey and luke after a few seconds of the same intense stare from the end of the force awakens  luke slowly approaches rey then starts crying and gives her a hug  luke is rey s dad  the scene plays out but when it ends  kylo ren s ship jumps out of hyperspace and lands on luke s planet along with an armada of star destroyers to engage the resistance in space in order to stop them from helping luke  luke does nt need a lightsaber he crushes kylo ren s ship with the force and throws it in the ocean there is no escape now while luke holds off the knights of ren using nothing but the force  rey has a rematch with kylo ren only this time  kylo is winning  we cut to another problem after the destruction of the new republic s hosnian system  the entire galaxy has been thrown into chaos so many factions are trying to take control of the galaxy  the black sun  the imperial loyalists  the mandalorians  and of course  the first order and the resistance poe dameron is sent to settle a dispute  and not a trade one  between the black sun and the new mandalorians it gets tense and eventually fighting starts  back to luke and rey kylo defeats rey luke reluctantly retreats to the millenium falcon with an unconcious rey luke contacts leia and orders the resistance to retreat  poe dameron returns to the resistance  unable to prevent another bloody battle  for the first time in a decade  luke and leia reunite it is very tense luke tells leia that there was a reason he was on that planet  to protect its secrets the temple doubles as the first jedi temple and the first sith temple since back then the difference between dark side and light side had not been established and everything was mostly experimentation  but most importantly  the temple contains what the knights of ren want  the secrets of immortality and ressurection  on luke s planet  the knights of ren are steaming they think they failed  but nexo ren does not unlike the others  he realizes they are standing near a sith temple eventually  they enter the temple and guess what they find  their dreams accomplished  we cut to kylo s star destroyer it is revealed that han solo s body was recovered from starkiller base thanks to some familiar nifty chutes will we see han solo get ressurected  cut back to rey she wakes up luke is waiting for her rey tearfully asks her father why she was abandoned on jakku confused  luke responds that he did not put her on jakku and tells her that he senses that somebody used the force to tamper with her mind luke attempts to restore her memory rey remembers her training as a padawan in the jedi academy  all her friends and how they were slaughtered by the knights of ren luke stops halfway  keep this in mind   realizing that the experience is too intense for rey or anybody for that matter rey can barely contain her rage kylo ren is responsible for all her problems  cut back to the knights of ren they are preparing to ressurect han solo the process is strange and esoteric eventually han solo starts breathing everyone is shocked ben solo approaches his father  i had a dream   han says  in it  you killed me  silence  it was only a dream   kylo says  pretending to chuckle but holding back tears  where am i   han mutters han sees the knights of ren and his health  which is being monitored  starts dropping drastically  it was nt a dream   han mutters he keeps repeating it over and over and over ben is horrified flatline like padme  han solo lost the will to live  i ll add more later  to be continued,4665qs,starwars,entertainment,1455677856.0,giantmexicanpotato,0.0,0.0,1,10,0.0
i hope you enjoyed reading what i have so far   which is in the op  here is the continuation  to understand kylo ren as a person  we must go back to the past  as mentioned briefly in the force awakens  han was not the best father and leia was always busy with politics and whatnot nobody had time for ben  one day  while being bullied for the fiftieth time  using the force for the first time  ben pushed a bully into a wall terrified of his new power  he ran away and found a place to cry alone or so he thought snoke appeared his appearance was less corrupted by the dark side snoke  comforted   really more like brainwashed  ben by telling him that what he did was justified because the bully did the same to him snoke then proceeds to tell ben the story of darth vader and the knights of ren darth vader helped create peace and order for the first time ever only for it to be destroyed by the rebel alliance and their chaotic new republic the knights of ren were obssesed with achieving the power of ressurection eventually  they gained it  and using it  they literally ressurected the sith and created the last sith empire  for peace and order of course  wink   before the republic came along and the sith had to follow the rule of two  but they were betrayed by the very sith they ressurected  eventually  ben came back home leia thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of ben s force sensitivity and send him off to luke but to ben it was like being abandoned  snoke continued brainwashing ben slowly  methodically  but there was always one thing standing in the way  his cousin  rey rey was the only person who was ever nice to him he related to rey because often rey was alone and ignored because her parents were always so busy when the time came to kill all the students of the jedi academy  kylo ren could not kill rey  we even see him  in rey s force vision  stabbing a knight of ren that was about to attack rey   being an unstable impulsive teen  he altered her memory and left her on jakku rey is kylo s mistake and also the key to his redemption ,d02s42e,starwars,entertainment,1455679522.0,giantmexicanpotato,1.0,0.0,1,10,0.0

   spoilers included for episode vii ending    hi everyone  new to the subreddit but longtime star wars fan apologies if this has been posted before but   i have some star wars truthering to do    one that challenges the narrative of the ending with which we ve been presented by lucasfilm  jj  rian and co   i would like to pause here to note that this is not a theory borne out of malice or wanting to expose something horrible  i love episode vii  sure i ll viii i just thought of it today and think it merits exploring and that it potentially reveals some insight into the creative process we ll see     anyway  my theory  the ending of episode vii where  spoiler again  rey extends the lightsaber to luke was never intended to be the ending of episode vii   stick with me here  so today  we were shown footage from the first day of production on episode viii which we were also told was happening at pinewood studios in london however  the footage we were shown was from rian s shoot at skellig michael i assume its footage from when he was spotted there with daisy ridley and mark hamill in fall 2015  http  birthmoviesdeathcom20150909starwarsepisodeviiiisshootingthismonth the first thing that struck me about the footage is that it used alternate shots of the same scene we saw at the end of episode vii also  pinewood studios is in london  not ireland so yeah nothing nefarious  right  except  why was rian ever shooting alternate takes of a scene we already see at the end of episode vii  where would that possibly be included in vii  featuring something like that is unprecedented in star wars  and sure  episode vii did some unprecedented things  but no  even small  time jump would just be odd  this lead me to a realization  the ending of episode vii was shot by rian and the original ending of vii was intended to be some form of rey with chewie flying off to find luke when jj and disney execs looked at the cut  they realized they did in fact maybe want luke in this film and got rian to handle the scene while jj finished up post and promotion to avoid any talks of reshoots remember that people panicked at the smallest delays in this process  another reason i think this  rey flying off at light speed  is  a star wars ending i love the ending with luke  but we ve never seen anything like it before also consider that rey and crew arrive at luke s planet literally right after a quick light speed jump why  probably because we were never supposed to get there in this film it plays like a second ending because it is one   this ending also could ve been added because it fit better with rian johnson s script  this also fits with michael ardnt s own assessment of problems with his script  he could nt figure out luke my theory is that kasdan and jj took over and pushed luke completely out of it  whereas arndt had him arriving more at the midpoint  and then realized they overcompensated and people might hate not seeing luke at all in this film  to recap   episode vii ending was supposed to be rey flying off into the sunset on a search for luke   jj and co got rian to shoot the skellig michael ending  passing it off as them starting on episode viii months before they actually would  with an announced delay in between   this might have a lot of errors and someone might be able to easily disprove this and i welcome it  i would love to hear people s general reaction to this might edit for links and errors thanks  reddit  edit  user umutantchair has provided us with this behind the scenesvisit ireland video showing jj on skellig  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  hjngrtatrdg i m not ready to take this to the truther levels of jj was only there to cover everything else upbut wo nt stop anyone else obviously  the most interesting thing remains that we may now be about to see the first star wars film to pick up directly where the previous left off so looking forward to discussions around that ,45z1ds,starwars,entertainment,1455574023.0,starwarstruther,46.0,0.0,1,1,0.0
there is only 1 problem with your theory  which i think could be right  btw   the shots shown in this teaser were shot in full daylight  both for luke s cu and for rey s ots harsh  undiffused daylight all the shots from the ending of tfa were shot on an overcast day while it is possible that may have shot 2 different versions of the scene  one with an overcast day and another one in a sunny day  it is unlikely they would have done this  unless they shot all the shots in the scene both ways   also  is nt there a behind the scenes video showing jj at this location with ridley and the crew ,d019aau,starwars,entertainment,1455580115.0,devotchko,26.0,0.0,121,22219,0.0
interesting  and possible  i figured the point was to tie up the episode vii arc of her getting roped in  her wanting to run  then her performing the greatest act she could as a part of her new destiny plus what an ending look at that badass i could have cried the first viewing han solo   chewie we re home  1010 moment luke skywalker     1510 i lost my crap strictly curious why does it matter that she went to lightspeed and then arrived  she just got the coordinates  could have just shown here pulling up with chewie i would nt be surprised if you re right edit   pulling up with chewie  is probably not the best way to say  arriving on the secluded island of luke skywalker ,d0166yi,starwars,entertainment,1455575290.0,poetech,9.0,0.0,35,10634,0.0

this may not be the place for it buy i have a theory about the filming process i think that the role maz played was originally supposed to be leia i think her character could have fit into that role of the associatelink to the resistance very well and fit hans slight reluctance when he mentions he knows someone that could get them in touch with the resistance it also makes more sense to me for leia to be the one to give rey the lightsaber and tell her about the force also it makes the scene towards the end when she hugs rey make more sense because as it stands it s weird that she and chewy do nt say a word after han s death and instead she goes and hugs rey  i think that after the started running lines with the actors they realized that carrie s acting had gotten pretty stiff and did an easy edit to limit her lines while still making her important enough to sell the whole passing of the torch motif ,d02gefv,starwars,entertainment,1455661477.0,durtyc,1.0,0.0,1,235,0.0

kylo does nt even realize just how out of his league darth vader is  and i do nt mean just in terms of vader s power with the force or the empire  s galactic conquests kylo is straightup missing the boat on the source of vader s darkness kylo believes that vader had some sort of ambition to bring order to the galaxy  and kylo also appears to presume that it was this ambition that served as the source of vader s dark power perhaps  ambition eventually fuels the fire for vader  but with the exception of a couple lines of dialog on naboo  there s just no indication that this was ever anakin s core motivation and that  s the key  the source of vader  s darkness has little to do about vader and much to do about anakin no  it wasn  t pure ambition for power  instead  it was anakin s love towards his mother and wife  the only people ever to show anakin unconditional love and warmth  which eventually leads to darkness  it s understandable for anakin  he grew up a slave to a single mother  and he had it rough this was not the princely upbringing likely enjoyed by ben solo so when anakin goes on some terrifying adventure  leaving his slave mother behind  never to see her again until she dies in his arms after being tortured to deathwhich he was forced to witness through nightmares  that is some heavy shit  anakin feels an immediate burden of loss and guilt that kylo simply could not begin to understand  so what does anakin do next  he vows never to let this happen to anyone he loves ever again  now that is ambition  but wait  there  s more   because it does happen again  but this time to the woman of his dreams for 10 years this dude waited to be with padme  he  s got all these new powers and abilities  and then he  s forced to face a repeat of his haunted past  nightmares of the death of the most important person in his life  and yet again  there s nothing he can do about it take all that lingering guilt and remorse over the loss of his mother  multiply it  and finally sprinkle on top the fact that this time it was actually anakin  s fault yikes  back to kylo sure  his dad might not always be around  his mom can be  tough  to deal with from time to time  and he  s stuck with his weird uncle maybe the politics of the new republic are pretty infuriating and the need for a strong leader is obvious perhaps an early 2000  s pop punk mix cd really hit a nerve in all seriousness  we re not 100  sure yet what the true cause of kylo s fall to the darkside was either way  it  s just not the same and it never could be can you blame kylo for not being  dark  enough  i don  t  he doesn  t have the rush of profound pain that fuels anakin  s dark side  for me  rewatching the prequels after tfa and comparing the characters of kylo and anakin helped me to appreciate both characters in new ways for kylo  i love the tragic struggle to find darkness where there is no pain  or at least not at the same level as anakin   for anakin  i have a new recognition for the overwhelming helplessness and loss resulting from his futile struggle to hold on to the ones he loves the complimentary nature of the two paths to darkness is satisfying in a way that feels very  star wars   and most of all i find myself enjoying both the pt and tfa more as a result ,45xhjz,starwars,entertainment,1455556349.0,OnAnEpisode,86.0,0.0,188,507,0.0

hi  i had a really interesting idea for a star wars story set in the late clone wars  an idea that i ve had since about season 2 or 3 of the show was on  and has developed to become very detailed and presumably publishable should i actually pursue it i ve always thought about how easily the bounty hunter jango fett was killed on geonosis  i hope this does nt count as a spoiler to any new fans   he asked for an unaltered clone to be regarded as a son along with his pay  but nothing else in his quote  regarding who hired him  it s quite clear that he may have an idea that he is working with the sith  and they re not necessarily your most trustworthy bunch as a bounty hunter  he s probably been double crossed before  and when the sith double cross you  you end up dead  they do nt want loose ends to meddle in their plans   fett obviously ends up dead  or does he  which is where my story would come into play my proposal is that he secretly had a small group of clones conditioned to be loyal only to him  and that he deployed them as decoys when he felt he would be double crossed having been in close quarters with count dooku on geonosis  there is a very high likelihood that fett overheard some of the master plans of tyranus and sidious  and  feeling that he knows too much  the sith decide to arrange his death so  when mace windu beheads fett  or who everyone thinks is fett  in the arena  he applauds his performance  as he will not have to deal with the wily bounty hunter on his own terms after the battle my story will claim that fett felt that the arena battle  which would surely start the war the sith had been planning  would serve as a perfect place for his employers to arrange an accident for him  and thus save some more money  and hassle if the jedi were to get a hold on him   so  fett deploys a decoy that convinces even his  son  boba  allowing him free roam in the galaxy but this is just backstory in the actual events of the story  anakin skywalker and the 501st are pinned down on a system relatively not far from kamino  and all active units are heavily engaged in combat  allowing them no reinforcements as a last resort  they contact kamino to send fresh troops  despite the fact that the  shinies  would be slaughtered by the separatist resistance  to no avail  as tipoca city is on lockdown when lama su refuses to give details to the cause  skywalker  kenobi  and captain rex depart the battle  leaving the capable jedi master eeth koth to watch over the remaining forces until their return on their arrival  they discover fett s dna has been stolen  but only clones and kaminoans have had access to it for the time leading to its disappearance long story short  it was fett who had arranged the theft  using one of his decoys  to get the jedi s attention  because he slipped up on security and the sith discovered his survival fearing the worst  fett wants the jedi s protection in return for information on the plot to destroy them  but is captured in a separatist raid  and taken to be executed by the sith one daring rescue mission with heavy casualties later  fett is back under republic protection  and reveals what he knows about protocol 66 and the empire  but the torture inflicted on him has addled his mind  rendering him unable to create clear thoughts  and only gives fragmented information to the jedi  leaving them only with more questions than answers as he utters an ominous warning to the jedi  something along the lines of  the jedi are already extinct   an assassin shoots him through the heart  tying up the loose end i feel like this story fits well with the theme of the sixth season of the clone wars series  and may include some discussion between palpatine and dooku after fett s death  talking about the potential damage to their plans i just wanted to hear some feedback regarding whether or not i should go through with it  and best method of doing so ,4665pe,starwars,entertainment,1455677840.0,FockerXC,1.0,0.0,1,2,0.0

my own personal theory   spoilers  max von sydow s characters importance and how that ties kylo ren  luke skywalker  and rey s origins together  i do not know how well known this is  but not all jedi are warriors in the prequels we see that one of the jedi  jocasta nu  who tells obiwan that kamino does not exist is a librariankeeper of the archives this is what i believe max von sydow s character  lor san tekka was for the academy luke started via the visual dictionary  lor san tekka is explained to be the leader of the church of the force  a group who believe in and follow the jedi s teachings i believe luke recruited him to come and preserve all that had happened over the last 60 some years  because he had seen the jedi at the height of their power  their demise  and the rise and fall of the empire he is also a well travelled individual and i believe he found the first jedi temple  created the map  and showed luke where it was located this is further cemented by in the opening scene of the movie when kylo makes a comment about lor s age and lor responds by saying he knew him before he was kylo this exchange puts them in the same place at the same time and i do not think that both of them being involved with the force is a coincidence they had to have been somewhere together where the teachings of the force were being preserved and taught again  hence luke s academy furthermore lor also has the piece of the map to luke  which luke must have entrusted to him after kylo ren destroyed the academy now here is the interesting part  rey was a member of the jedi academy or was a newly found force sensitive in her vision after touching the light saber she is seen crying for her family only after witnessing kylo and the kotr destroy the academy the sequence of events of the vision make sense and would be an amazing job by jj at dropping subtle hints to her origins if true after the slaughter of the academy luke has either just found rey and is about to bring her to the academy or he had already found her and she had been there for a short time before the raid either way luke met up with lor san tekka  after the raid  and they decided to hide her on jakku where lor san tekka would watch over her with his disciples and guard the piece of the map to skywalker and the 1st jedi temple the only difference is that if she had previously been at the academy luke would have wiped to her mind using the force so that she would be safe from the first order from discovering her luke then headed for the 1st jedi temple and asked lor san tekka to guard the last piece rey has no relation to any previous characters  which is not the reason luke stares at her with emotion at the end the leaked script states that he is looking at her with a kindness in his eyes but a torture too  and that she does nt need to speak because he knows why she is there this is more truth that rey is reminding him of his failed apprentice  slaughtered academy  and that he now knows what must be done to save the galaxy ,d01mcz0,starwars,entertainment,1455602087.0,YnotZoidberg15,3.0,0.0,5,1288,0.0
it was love that drove anakin down the path to the dark side hence why jedi s are forbidden to love although kylo s path is nt  as far as we know  caused by love  there are different reasons to one wanting to join the dark side and one of those reasons is the quest for pure power which seems to be the angle kylo is working ,d017lxa,starwars,entertainment,1455577455.0,Dirtywatter,3.0,0.0,2,1775,0.0

good to see appreciation for the storyline and not just general dismissal of the prequels  until we know more about kylo and his motivations  the turning of anakin to the dark side will always be the shade kylo sits in  we ve seen his strength in the force with his blaster bolt freeze yet his saber skills and lack of finesse showcase the long road he has to travel to rival his grandfather in power he lacks vader s conviction because he feels entitled  i am very curious about how the training of kylo and rey will affect the next time they meet ,d00wz5q,starwars,entertainment,1455561925.0,AbstractProphet,25.0,0.0,1,24,0.0

gt  him being alive takes away from quigons death and obiwans status as the first to kill a sith in a thousand years  him being alive takes away from darth maul  let s be perfectly clear heredarth maul is the prequels  boba fett a bad ass character with only a few lines  scant screen time  and then he was dead  lucas managed to strike gold not once  but twice a secondary character was the coolest thing ever  and then managed to ruin it  rule number one in entertainment is  always leave the audience wanting more  darth maul was that if he never had another second of screen time he d have secured his place in the pantheon of memorable star wars characters ,d02thj4,starwars,entertainment,1455681843.0,gogojack,0.0,0.0,1514,93328,1.0
i loved darth maul in tcw  however i agree that the act of bringing him back was pretty legendsish i m pretty sure it s also at least partially based off an eu story  specifically the spider leg design  i survived because lololol dark side op   it falls under the same category as dark empire palpatine s clones and vitiatevalkorion in tor possessing everyone to come back to life ,d02t8if,starwars,entertainment,1455681405.0,ProbeEmperorblitz,5.0,0.0,13,20448,0.0

also another bit of symbolism with kylo ren s lightsaber  it s all sparky and crackly  as if to represent his role as a sith he s a very strong sith  and very powerful  but also he s very unsure of his abilities  as we see with his obsession with darth vader and him wanting to be as strong as vader  meaning he does nt believe he is as strong as him i think the sparkiness of the saber was intentional ,d02nuyc,starwars,entertainment,1455672879.0,ejm4th116,1.0,0.0,1,440,0.0

i meant to save all my kotor art to post together when i finish but it  s taken too long and i got bored so here  s my reimagining of juhani it  s been on the backburner while i work on other work stuff like commissions and the rest of the kotor crew previous research indicated that she  s wellhated  and i think her design was not very good  so i decided to reign in some of the more extreme decisions made by the bioware team i think she had a lot of cool potential  so i tried to make her less of a weird furry and more of a bad bitch  specs  i painted this entirely in 2d in photoshop on a cintiq tablet final file is 9k px tall and 44gb preexport hundreds of layers  i don  t feel like counting yes  that means it  s  not a real painting   it  s a digital painting it probably took over a hundred hours  though i don  t count anymore my brushes are from many sources including the most popular and famous brushsets out there  such as jaime jones   maciej kuciara  s  shaddy safadi  s  and plenty of custom ones i have a little folder of like twenty favourite brushes that i do 95  of my painting with  please hit me with any questions or input you have  thanks for looking ,d014wj8,starwars,entertainment,1455573343.0,corbinhunter,13.0,0.0,7580,2899,0.0

i do nt think the choice to do it was bad  but i think the execution was him suddenly appearing in clone wars with weird cybernetic spider legs was just a bad decision if he had somehow been rescued while still on naboo and reconstructed more like anakin s transformation into darth vader  that would have been more acceptable his hatred keeping him alive is basically just a copout and asks me to suspend my disbelief too far ,d02sp0c,starwars,entertainment,1455680496.0,Glumalon,5.0,0.0,175,5286,0.0
this is a funny little problem with the story i only recently noticed myselfalthough the redemption of vader and death of the emperor is the emotional climax of the film and series it actually does nt really change the outcome except for luke himself if luke had turned to the dark side  he would have just been blown up with the rest of the death star  i did nt recognize it as such back in the day  but timothy zahn s heir to the empire has a little retcon hack to fix the  problem  thrawn at one point explains that the emperor was boosting his troops with the force until he was killed once he died  the efficiency of the imperial fleet plummeted and the executor was blown upand if you watch the film with this in mind the timing totally lines up  all three storylines turn favorable for the rebels at the same time so in the old legends canon at least  the death of the emperor was key to the rebel victory ,d027z20,starwars,entertainment,1455650216.0,UnsealedMTG,5.0,0.0,2672,20826,0.0
i wish tfa would ve talked more about the political landscape of the galaxy i know they re trying to stay away from the overpoliticized prequel feel but a bit more detail about the first order  resistance  and new republic would be nice and could go a long way  in the novelvisual dictionary it s explained that the first order has been playing possum and the new republic  along with the rest of the galaxy  does nt take them seriously  hence why poe is so surprised when he arrives in the star destroyer and sees legions of stormtroopers and tie fighters   it also suggests the new republic is struggling to keep control of the galaxy  and even implies that there are a few corrupt members of the new republic who want leia dead  which is why she runs the resistance and why she really wants to find luke  this all could ve been conveyed in a few lines and would ve given the audience a better understanding of how the empire is back all of a sudden and why the rebels seem to be back at square one ,d02618v,starwars,entertainment,1455647596.0,ChetSteadman2274,19.0,0.0,1,3707,0.0

yes  when i read that they were shooting at skellig michael in september  i did wonder if it was a last minute addition to ep vii and not an early shoot for viii the former makes more sense  after all  jj was still putting together his final cut of the film well into october or possibly later they must have realised that they wanted this scene at the end and they shot it last minute in sept i completely believe it ,d0167jc,starwars,entertainment,1455575314.0,tinman2000,0.0,0.0,155,2743,0.0
i think anakin s fall actually had more to do with guilt than anything else  he feels guilty about breaking the jedi code  so he harbours his feelings for his mother and padme instead of consulting obiwan or yoda  who could help him work through it  he feels guilty about killing dooku  so it s important for him that sheev is properly arrested and tried on top of that  sheev has been playing on his guilt over his mother and padme  then the jedi sort of rub his face in the guilt he feels over his inadequacies as a jedi there s more in the clone wars  but just in the movie  they let him on the council  but do nt give him the rank of master pretty insultinghumiliating when you think about it  then on top of that he s wracked with guilt while the jedi are hypocrites makes it easy to protect palpatine in the moment hell  mace was in some pretty questionable territory trying the execute sheev like that  after mace dies  though  anakin feels too guilty to go back to the jedi guilt  pride  and fear the hate does nt come until later  it s actually amazing to think about the events of dark disciple anyone that s read that should know that anakin really never hit the point of no return sheev used his guilt to make him feel like he had no choice  though ,d018vzb,starwars,entertainment,1455579478.0,5aucy,11.0,0.0,4437,27113,0.0

ok so i like them both for their own reasons wingreen has a special place in my heart since he is the og boba and his delivery of  he s no good to me dead  is both intimidating and badass as he basically just tells vader not to fuck up i feel like morrison s delivery lacks some of that nonchalant badassery and instead becomes more of a questioning statement regardless  morrison s voice makes a little bit more sense canonically seeing as boba is now a clone of his father now  i do nt think that even him being a clone would mean his exact diction and accent would be the same as his  fathers   boba would sound similar to jango sure but an exact copy of his voice  i find that a little hard to believe although  he sure as hell would nt sound like wingreen does having morrison voice boba makes that character lose some of the individuality that made the character so awesome  despite getting his ass eaten by a giant sand vagina  and instead makes all of his triumphs and backstory sort of piggyback on his fathers success and inherent abilities he becomes a  knockoff  clone of his father  and not his own man ultimately  i have to go with wingreen as a better voice not because he sounds better  but because with that voice it s apparent that boba really grew to become the badass bounty hunter that he was and not just trying to be his father through and through ,d02pe76,starwars,entertainment,1455675211.0,OH1O1SONF1R3,2.0,0.0,224,2324,0.0

i m liking the idea of kylo ren as being driven to find the power of the dark side and become worthy of darth vader s legacy  but i find kylo s  missing the boat   as it were  to be more interesting than annoying  as a lot of other people feel  it s obvious that kylo is  a  powerful in the force  and  b  utterly convinced that the dark side is the right way to go  and i think that that  combined with his obsession with being like darth vader  has a tonne of potential that we ve already started to see this is a person who is willing to do horrific things  you know what i m talking about  in order to try to gain the power level of darth vader he is already terrified of not being as powerful as the ol  dv  but there s something else there  an even deeper fear that he wo nt even let himself contemplate  what if he s wrong  what if he ll never be like darth vader   regardless  of how much he s worked and lost  what if the dark side  is nt  the path to fulfilling his potential  and never was  it would mean that everything he s done  every bit of physical and emotional agony and suffering that he has inflicted on himself  everything he gave up and destroyed in the name of furthering his power  has nt meant shit  and never will mean shit  and right now  in my 4th year of college  looking out at an uncertain future in a field i sometimes wonder if i actually want to go into  with nothing to my name but a trucktonne of student loans and four years of stress and work  that s a fear that i can completely understand ,d01inx4,starwars,entertainment,1455595013.0,NecronPariah,3.0,0.0,13028,8814,0.0

i do the exact same thing with fictional universes  they make more sense than the real world most of the time  haha  do nt know if you want advice  but as someone who s going through a somewhat similar situation  everyone dies that s just the way of things it s more important to spend time with people while they re here so you can look back on them fondly even more important is to set things to look forward to and with your brother  i highly recommend trying to connect with him and just be there for him when parents are gone  siblings are often the closest family you ve got it d be nice to have that kind of support  i m glad you can find joy in star wars nice  and insanely talented  people are all around this fandom  so it s not a bad place to be ,d01h261,starwars,entertainment,1455592441.0,Radventure,5.0,0.0,231,2393,0.0

why do people get upset about the idea of the thermal exhaust port  internal power station  or thermal oscillator  it makes sense that a base that contains so much powerenergy needs a way to control it it s not an a fatal flaw in the empire s weapons design  it s a part of the rationale of the design ,463qmg,starwars,entertainment,1455646369.0,kc1200,4.0,0.0,1,69,0.0

the sheer improbability of that weakness being exploited is what makes the rebels  victory  resistance victory in vii  such a triumph  they were able to penetrate and destroy the empire s  ultimate power in the universe  by making the desperate move of taking out the thermal exhaust port,d026c7e,starwars,entertainment,1455648009.0,kc1200,8.0,0.0,1,69,0.0
while i agree with your sentiment  i do nt agree with trying to explain it with rationale i see so many posts below trying to rationalize why it had to be that way  but seriously folks  any engineering degree grad will laugh at the idea that it  had to be that way  or that if it was nt that  than it would be something else yes  there would be something else next on the list of next most vulnerable  but you can engineer it so the next most vulnerable weakness is not so easily exploitable nothing is indestructible  but the ds was nt even close we have modern war machines that have less obvious design flaws than the ds  the real answer is   because it s a damn movie  and   this   should be enough of an explanation to anyone having a beef with the thermal exhaust port ,d02fnvd,starwars,entertainment,1455660444.0,BaconKnight,3.0,0.0,1170,32119,0.0

i meant to save all my kotor art to post together when i finish but it  s taken too long and i got bored so here  s my reimagining of juhani it  s been on the backburner while i work on other work stuff like commissions and the rest of the kotor crew previous research indicated that she  s wellhated  and i think her design was not very good  so i decided to reign in some of the more extreme decisions made by the bioware team i think she had a lot of cool potential  so i tried to make her less of a weird furry and more of a bad bitch  specs  i painted this entirely in 2d in photoshop on a cintiq tablet final file is 9k px tall and 44gb preexport hundreds of layers  i don  t feel like counting yes  that means it  s  not a real painting   it  s a digital painting it probably took over a hundred hours  though i don  t count anymore my brushes are from many sources including the most popular and famous brushsets out there  such as jaime jones   maciej kuciara  s  shaddy safadi  s  and plenty of custom ones i have a little folder of like twenty favourite brushes that i do 95  of my painting with  please hit me with any questions or input you have  thanks for looking ,d014wj8,starwars,entertainment,1455573343.0,corbinhunter,13.0,0.0,7580,2899,0.0

my film study class had a discussion today about whether or not it s right for a director or movie maker to go back and make changes to the original movies inevitably  george lucas and star wars came upi wo nt launch a recycled  who shot first  debate  but rather  one about a change that is nt discussed as much  the voice  s  of boba fett  as you all probably know  jason wingreen voiced boba in the theatrical version of esb  and gave him a grittier  more rogue voice in the special edition changes  temura morrison rerecorded the lines following the revelation that boba was a clone of jango consequently  morrison essentially gave boba the voice of a clone trooper  which voice do you prefer for boba fett  and why ,465n7e,starwars,entertainment,1455670749.0,gfoster18,7.0,0.0,55,504,0.0
i prefer morrison after all  boba is a fully unaltered clone  and to preserve continuity it only makes sense that boba should sound like his father i mean  i hold nothing against wingreen  he sounded awesome  but i think morrison makes more sense ,d02mmni,starwars,entertainment,1455671009.0,TrueMarksmens,13.0,0.0,552,14734,0.0
wingreen he fit boba as he s portrayed in  empire  far better than morrison  and there s no reason to think boba would ve kept his  kiwi  accent over time accents are nt genetic  they re environmental  shaped by the accents you hear on a daily basis it would be perfectly logical to assume boba s accent faded over time ,d02n3eb,starwars,entertainment,1455671734.0,EveryGoodNameIsGone,6.0,0.0,24,35420,0.0

ok so i like them both for their own reasons wingreen has a special place in my heart since he is the og boba and his delivery of  he s no good to me dead  is both intimidating and badass as he basically just tells vader not to fuck up i feel like morrison s delivery lacks some of that nonchalant badassery and instead becomes more of a questioning statement regardless  morrison s voice makes a little bit more sense canonically seeing as boba is now a clone of his father now  i do nt think that even him being a clone would mean his exact diction and accent would be the same as his  fathers   boba would sound similar to jango sure but an exact copy of his voice  i find that a little hard to believe although  he sure as hell would nt sound like wingreen does having morrison voice boba makes that character lose some of the individuality that made the character so awesome  despite getting his ass eaten by a giant sand vagina  and instead makes all of his triumphs and backstory sort of piggyback on his fathers success and inherent abilities he becomes a  knockoff  clone of his father  and not his own man ultimately  i have to go with wingreen as a better voice not because he sounds better  but because with that voice it s apparent that boba really grew to become the badass bounty hunter that he was and not just trying to be his father through and through ,d02pe76,starwars,entertainment,1455675211.0,OH1O1SONF1R3,2.0,0.0,224,2324,0.0

that movie s plot point was so obvious i knew it before the teaser trailer was even released it s so hard to talk about it without spoilers but it had to happen  because the actor really wanted it to hell he wanted it in rotj edit  the new trilogy is also a multi year project and the actor in question may not have that much left in him in the process of filming the new movie he was in both a plane crash and a broken ankle ,d02ajwc,starwars,entertainment,1455653672.0,Creski,2.0,0.0,177,10369,0.0
looking at kylos lightsaber again there are 2 very distinct exposed wires  a blue wire and a red wire as everyone knows  the lightsaber color of choice for the sithdark side is red  and one of the main colors of lightsabers for jedi is blue on kylos lightsaber  the blue wire is very short in comparison to the red wire  symbolizing that he still has some of the light side in him  but its being over shadowed by the dark side ,465etm,starwars,entertainment,1455667393.0,Pat_RedHawk,14.0,0.0,43,82,0.0

also another bit of symbolism with kylo ren s lightsaber  it s all sparky and crackly  as if to represent his role as a sith he s a very strong sith  and very powerful  but also he s very unsure of his abilities  as we see with his obsession with darth vader and him wanting to be as strong as vader  meaning he does nt believe he is as strong as him i think the sparkiness of the saber was intentional ,d02nuyc,starwars,entertainment,1455672879.0,ejm4th116,1.0,0.0,1,440,0.0

luke skywalker was located  when he s interrogating rey  he starts  seeing  what she sees in her mind  during this scene he says something along the lines of the following  i see the sea i see an island  now  i ca nt find the script to see if it backs me up on this  as i might have heard it wrong  but if i did  i think that was a very nicely placed bit of dialogue ,4662h3,starwars,entertainment,1455676614.0,vaderdarthvader,6.0,0.0,11760,23124,0.0

not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep 8 or even 9  where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training  but when she completes her own saber  it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle involving rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors ,4637t7,starwars,entertainment,1455640261.0,prooveit1701,50.0,0.0,1,4317,0.0
i hope that rey has a decent amount of training and her own lightsaber already built by the start of episode 8  preferably a doublebladed one as a nod to her staff a fight with rey and luke back to back against the knights of ren led by kylo would be sick if it happens i hope they have a confident kylo and his knights do some badass stuff to signify his progression and vindicate the  little bitch  rep he kind of has that would be some good character development,d021kuh,starwars,entertainment,1455641458.0,durtyc,45.0,0.0,1,235,0.0

yeah  that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke  and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh  i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides  are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen ,d02b0zt,starwars,entertainment,1455654296.0,niccinco,13.0,0.0,671,20964,0.0
