blademail does nt reflect damage against a hero with bkb active which ta wants to get as a third item usually after blink and deso also i do nt believe you can blademail sleight of fist damage so it would really only help against wr except she would normally ult you after a like a blink shackle catching you off guard and you d be unable to trigger your blademail so that probably was not the best item choice  i ve noticed in a few pro games spectres go some combination of urn drum or aqi before going for a major item like radiance manta or diffusal it helps with early survivability and you can actually accomplish something with a lvl 6 haunt then if you are farming well radiance is a great follow up or if you are behind go for the diffusal or manta  the lack of a manta is confusing to me its such a great item on spectre and i do believe you can manta out of ember chains the yasha build up to it will help accelerate your farm as well  skadi would have probably been a better option than butterfly this game  as its been said  several of their heroes like getting mkbs  bkb would have probably also been a choice item against chains lift shackle shackle is strong against illusion heroes if you can target the right hero so bkb would have been great ,d02bdmd,dota2,gaming,1455654742.0,Zykor,1.0,0.0,1,1,0.0

gt  i  ve held off playing ranked because i think it  s important to learn a range of heroes before jumping into games that people take seriously it would suck playing ranked and saying  hey i can only play dp or dazzle  so  yea   most ppl actually do nt care about such things  they try to play ranked asap no matter if they know game mechanics  heroes  etc and they do nt care runining other ppl s games because all that counts is their own goals  thus  your attitude is respectable  but do nt assume others think the same way  they do not and you will be disappointed when playing ranked that s a promise so before you get into ranked make sure you are prepared for flaming tryhards and dickheads who do nt know much about dota but claim to be perfect players frustration incoming  ___ 1 to focus on certain positions can help to develop better understanding of heroes and mechanics in general yet  you should try to play many different heroes in order to find out what really suits you some heroes are more difficult than others due to more micro  others have many spells andor items  other aspects are last hit animations  attack range  attack speed  etc every hero is different and you will have to get a feeling for each of them give all  or most  of them a try  based on whatever criteria  be it nice plays you watched  interesting spells or things like that i would nt stick to certain heroes just because some ppl think they are great or easy to play or ez wins or whatever pick what you like and see how you manage usually an average about 10 games per hero is enough to decide if you want to continue playing or rather never touch that hero again this does nt mean you should play a minimum of 10 games with every hero before hitting ranked  just as a rule of thumb how to get a feeling  2 since attacks are hero specific learning to last hit and deny properly can be quite difficult some claim to start with rather difficult heroes  one of which would be zeus others would recommend easy heroes like wraith king or chaos knight  or whatever their personal preferences are pick a few heroes you feel comfortable with and just practice after some time you will be able to manage almost every hero usually ranged heroes have the advantage of distance to the creep wave  meaning you can last hit and deny a bit more comfortable due to not being directly in enemy hero range  3 less greedy laning comes with map awareness playing many support heroes actually helped me a lot with this because i was never tempted to rely on ss calls or other supports doing their job as support i feel responsible for everything that has to do with vision  so placing wards is just the beginning i watch the map constantly  calling ss for every lane  seeing rotations  warning allies  etc at the same time supports have less health so you play a bit more careful in general an alternative would be to play heroes that can be gankedkilled easily eg sniper with him you will have to have good map awareness and also work hard on positioning  or you will be destroyed so i d pick low hp heroes with bad escape to learn this lesson  4 what to do when  that s not really easy there is not really a  decision making 101   basically you will have to analyze a situation in order to make a decision does it make sense to tp  what can you do when you arrive  do you have the needed abilities to have any impact or will you just feed the enemy  how about your item progression  how much will it slow you down to help out  how much will it throw you back if you get killed  can you maybe achieve more by staying in lane  there are several things to consider  eg how good can you push  using that space your team creates for you atm  does enemy have tp  are you even safe alone  what can you farm  lanejungle  at the moment  many questions to ask and the answers are all very situational one thing i can tell you  never fight without vision  because in most cases it wo nt end well they only legit reason to dabble into the darkness of enemy territory is when using a smoke to either get a quick gank or rather to ward other than that there is a good chance you andor your team will be surprised  it is seldom worth the risk  5 learn how to stack in lobby quite easy once you know the timing also be aware of different neutral behaviour when attacking there is also a custom map that shows camp spawn boxes use that one to learn which spots can be used to block camps so you know where to place sentries to deward and unblock camps  6 when you are roaming you are usually playing a hero in safeoff lane a good approach is to have a smoke and ward vision of your destination then take the rune that is closest to you  if mid or other hero does nt need  and decide where you go from there ganking mid is never a bad idea  unless you andor your mid lack lockdown or chasing abilities you also want enemy hero to walk as long as possible  when far away from their own tower also keep in mind to smoke in an area where enemy does nt have vision  then circle around so you can come from behind and surprise enemy be patient  but do nt waste too much time waiting for the right moment if you decide to gank a different lane  proceed the same always have tp to escape or help out if other lanes are being pressured  always bring some sort of detection just in case a hero has invis  a hero who can escape by using an invis skill is not a dead hero and a waste of time and ressources  so you need to make sure the gank is successful by preparing the gank and make sure it works out use trees to cover you if possible additional to invis rune or smoke  just in case of some unexpected enemy visiting the lane you want to gank in general  best time to gank is as early as possible with all the needed preparation and items you should have at least brown boots  if not you need stunsslowany kind of lockdown or at least an orb of venom to maximize the time dmg is dealt make sure the lane you are ganking has enough mana and spells to participate  eg if your mid invoker has no mana and all spells on cooldown you do nt even have to go there so always check if your team mates are rdy and communicateannounce that you will come to gank so they do nt waste their manaspells on creeps  7 you should play heroes in ranked you feel comfortable with if 20 games each gives you that feeling you sure can play ranked but be aware that having played a certain amount of heroes and knowing their skills actually does not suffice  if i were you i d play the more common heroes at least once or twice to find out what they can do and where their limits are you will need that knowledge when you are facing them yourself there s nothing more embarrassing than running away from bloodseeker ult  or running into dark seer wall  sitting around in jakiro ult  or running away from undying zombies  etc in order to not panic and to make the right decision in fights you need to know your enemy so play more games with other heroes  maybe find 34 that you might like even more than your current ones  then go for your  20 games before ranked  thing  8 check out the regional channels if you have nt yet there might be also a subreddit  not sure though other than that there are plenty steam groups for certain regions  i m sure seattle or at least us west has some dota steam groups  other than that  good luck  mate  i like your attitude a lot and i hope you wo nt get too disappointed during the next few months always try to stay positive

whenever i play higher skill cap heroes in a game  i notice i do significantly better when my team knows how to play with that hero case in point is pudge someone stuns and then moves so you can hook is the proper way to play with a pudge however  i often see people not move to give an opening for the hook and those games are more often lost than the games where teammates do move the point is that stunning does not give free reign to hook  but a stunned target and open space allows for a hook now  positioning and sometimes lucky hook  hooking from enemy blind spots play into this as well  but the point is that you need to learn how to play with invoker and whatever play style that voker chooses  exort invoker make space via constant fighting and allow him to split push and pick off solo targets while quas wex calls for strong follow upstrong ability to kite from your team  ,d02suml,dota2,gaming,1455680755.0,Happymealify,1.0,0.0,1,-29,0.0

i calibrated at 800 mmr back in 2014 and managed to climb to 22k  where i plateaud for the better part of a year  i think there was a time where i briefly enjoyed the game but most of the time i spent playing i was just desperately chasing a number to try to get some sort of validation in my life and feel like i was becoming proficient at something that i could clearly measure against other people to feel superior to them  or feel at the very least like i belonged with them several times i was reduced to tears and i also know for a fact that i made some people feel completely awful for underperforming in a video game designed to be played for enjoyment  and i get super disgusted in myself when i think about it  in doing so i neglected a lot of solitary hobbies that actually gave me a sense of fulfillment and pleasure  it was the first year i went without drawing anything solid  and became an absolute wreck of a person when i finally made a dude cry on mic i got into regular sessions with a psychologist and uninstalled dota  i am finally stabilizing and am posting this here in the hope that it will give me and someone in a similar position some sort of catharsis it has been a very humbling and enlightening experience and i will be sure to never get immersed in a multiplayer competitive game again ,461soj,dota2,gaming,1455616584.0,Pudge-The-Butcher,493.0,0.0,95,65,0.0

i feel you the game s not fun anymore for me and before i could realize this i had neglected my responsibilities on school and myself as well but the reason i kept playing so much back then was because i was so anxiousdepressed about going home without feeling like i ve accomplished something  note that i do nt have a pc and that i play on gaming cafes   i would play 8  10 hours  no standing up most of the time  no eating  because i could nt just leave when there are people that are lined up to play when you leavetime is done   ca nt respond to my girlfriend s callstexts  and the worst part is  i skipped classes for this so every time i come home and win nothing  i just feel super fucking cheap and feel like the scum of the earth i could nt even face my mother when she asks me why i come home late and just throw a fit at her when she did nothing wrong like fuck  anyway the only reason i stopped was because i got carried so hard just last month by a 7k mmr booster he did everything right while the lion on our team flamed him for almost half of the game for not joining team fights we lost most of the team fights but he carried us and  while we were having our celebratory fountain diving the lion praised him for playing really good  and the invoker  the booster  replied by calling us  dog shits  and    having no life     which got to me he s right i mean  i ve been playing the game since beta and i ca nt even go higher than sub 5k right now  and seeing him carry us made me think of how much time i ve lost and gained nothing over this but have just been chasing this number that wo nt probably mean anything more than what it is  so  after that i decided that i would no longer play the game  or at least not as hard as i used to i m still playing  but just at least once a week  for 5  6 hours  with breaks this time   i actually feel so happy that i ve made that decision i ve focused on so much more stuff other than the game  so yea i m sorry if this is too long to read but i just wanted to vent my feelings as well since i relate to op on the matter of having the game control their life glad for op on moving on as well  wishing you the best for the future    cheers  also sorry if there are unclear stuffs about what i m trying to point out  english is nt my main language  ,d01vlky,dota2,gaming,1455631574.0,da7thsin,8.0,0.0,4,3339,0.0

if you ever feel like playing a comp game again  tf2 s community is extremely chill for the most part even when i was complete trash at the game i still had a lot of fun playing it because there s just so much you can do that does nt affect anyone but you  since the game does nt really cares if you win or lose  nobody goes around flaming each other for every little thing there s people who do it  obviously  but for the most part everyone is so terrible that it does nt matter  specially on valve servers  seriously  i was surprised how different both communities are  i made a huge amount of friends playing tf2  like 90  of my steam friends   and when i started playing dota i felt like i was thrown in a brazilian favela wearing fancy clothes ,d01yiny,dota2,gaming,1455636906.0,Lemon_Girl,1.0,0.0,178,3188,0.0

this is really bad you d think that in general esports business is very shady and not many people can share information with the public so a team like secret would be able to show how it can be done  but apparently not  this is a major hit to the brand if you ask me having no strings attached to an org was a major point for people to root secret not only because of the players  but also because of the idea behind the team  this just seems like it s just safer to go with an org if you are a successful player rather than trying something in your own  edit  i also generally do nt like when stuff like this gets posted on social media money problems should be privat affairs  but god damn it has been over a year for them to pay people accordingly ,d02hzcw,dota2,gaming,1455663759.0,g0ggy,21.0,0.0,2293,6482,0.0

two ideas  first  aghanims scepter changes the passive skill into an active  autocastable skill with a 05 cooldown  or perhaps changes it so that the passive applies for every two hits  storm could be a pos1 carry this way  with moon shards   this might change the concept of the hero kind of similar to the old storm spirit before 658  second idea  adds a new skill  that uses half of storm s maximum mana the new skill is similar to riki s ulti storm circulates an area  with 600 range radius    zipping the area and hitting the enemies inside with his attack speed at the moment he initiated the skill storm spirit applies the passive skill on the first and the last hits he does ,d02d2lf,dota2,gaming,1455656987.0,ptrlix,1.0,0.0,1,183,0.0

this should be run differently  the games being one after another is fine  it should happen  if both teams are ready  otherwise there needs to be a buffer  you cant expect a team to be ready 40 mins before the game on the off chance that there are 2 stomps  so have a 15 minute buffer  get the teams to be ready 15 mins beforehand so that if a series is short then teams are nt going to be instaforfeited unless they miss the 15 minute mark,d02ia91,dota2,gaming,1455664216.0,mcshrek201,0.0,0.0,13,1513,0.0

man  vega is such a wildcard team they are a lot of fun to watch  this is reminding me of esl one ny where they just showed great command of everything i came out of that with a whole new respect for them and still enjoy watching them  even beating up my favorite team  too bad they will probably go into another drought again after this  like they tend to ,d02t9mr,dota2,gaming,1455681460.0,JoeDiesAtTheEnd,1.0,0.0,4025,13436,0.0
wow  what a tournament for alliance  they dominated so hard the entire group stage and against liquid  big kudos to vega for being the only team in the tournament to figure out how to beat alliance they outplayed them completely while every other team got stomped completely  well done vega ,d02rs48,dota2,gaming,1455678978.0,Anders_A,1.0,0.0,3475,15365,0.0
