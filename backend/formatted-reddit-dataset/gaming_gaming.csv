my thoughts are  fallout 4 was great so was skyrim i have 750 something hours on skyrim and i m working my way up on fallout i bought all of the skyrim expansions and would probably buy more if they released them i m also probably going to buy all of the fallout 4 expansions over the next few years  my only concern for the future of my time with fallout is the modding community since i m still new to fallout 4  i have nt even glanced at the nexus yet as far as skyrim goes though  the modding community is responsible for probably 500 hours of the playtime i have on skyrim if the fallout modding community grows to something that is similar to skyrim s  i ll be good to go for the next few years i ve even gone back to skyrim lately because i burned myself out on fallout  these fallout dlcs regardless of what they add or how much they cost will only serve to give modders more material to work with i for one am psyched to see what they come up with  sorry consolers ,d02dcy2,gaming,gaming,1455657373.0,jjcnc82,1.0,0.0,1,3975,0.0

call of duty  world at war the entire thing on veteran  now do nt get me wrong  loved the game it was the one before cod started really going downhill granted  i still enjoyed the shit out of black ops 1 and 2  but world at war was the best of them that being said  fuck that game s veteran mode it was my favorite game for years i ve beaten every cod up to black ops 2 on veteran  excluding world at war i could nt do it  world at war s idea of difficulty is to have the enemy spam grenades everywhere in any other cod  you take cover  you move slowly and methodically  you take shots where you can world at war  if you re behind cover for more than two seconds  there s five grenades on top of you you had to constantly keep moving or you died the problem with that is that not being behind cover also got you killed it was basically a catch 22  you had to leave cover to not die  which killed you granted it was clearly possible  but i ve never seen anybody who s actually done it say that it was anywhere near easy ,d025p5a,gaming,gaming,1455647145.0,RTSUbiytsa,1.0,0.0,1,3539,0.0

i never really understood why they did nt further develop this system with the years  rubber banding is one thing  but item manipulation really further defines the issue  if they just developed more items outside of their current normtheme  you could turn first place into a more defensivebased item game while items become more offensive as you move down the ranks develop strategy and specific usage of items rather than blindly firing whatever you get create interesting item interactions or completely new items if this was the case  rubber banding would add to the gameplay  making it more high tension  fast paced  a real battle ,d02fwtv,gaming,gaming,1455660792.0,Funkays,5.0,0.0,192,19560,0.0

so am i missing a inside joke  or is it just the joke that wedding rings normally have a emotional weight and value attached to them that you cant put in numbers and a good part of players just see it as a item they can sell later  a metaphor for todays society where most weddings are a financial move and not driven by emotions  that most relation ship that even start with emotions get ripped down to numbers of the vaule you share with the partner when you get a divorce after years and years of distrust  where one of the partners worked hours and hours after the regular work end to give the other partner the opportunity to life to its fullest because the partner thought thats the only thing the partner deserved  and after all the work and pain you went thought you to get greeted by distrust and growing hate  to see the remains of the hard work in shards of the broken object in the room after a heavy fight  to know that all these years you where wrong and all the partner wanted was you  that the kids that are a reminder to happier time are suffering under the fights and screaming  that the innocent loved ones are suffering under a simple misunderstanding  that they might even more suffer because they might think they are the problem  you think you would know better now that every day you walk thought the shards of lamps which mirror your former happy life every day you wake up on a mattress on the ground after the divorce took everything you had and now only dirt and shards are what is left over  every day you go past the ripped apart photos that painfully remind you of the the oregon roadtrip where your kids enjoyed the tourist traps in the stops every day you walk past the dead memories of a life you cant get back everyday you leave through the door you once carried your wife in off to work you go because its the only thing that is left from your former life what is left of your current life now you have way to much money  then you could ever think off because thats the only thing you do recently you found the ring you once nervously bought for the big day but now all the love is gone its a cash number now so you sell it because making money is the only goal you have now ,d02b57k,gaming,gaming,1455654448.0,Stefen_007,-9.0,0.0,1,5247,0.0

the thing is we got a full  functioning game at launch the game was a huge success financially more so than was originally planned they had decided early on how much dlc they wanted to make so they set a price point then at  30 now the want to expand the game farther than planned so raising the season pass is acceptable they are allowing us to decide if we want to go ahead and buy the season pass at the original price before they raise it i think that s fair with buying the season pass now we know we are getting the two small dlc plus the first big expansion and based on the price for those individually we get more than our moneys worth now they said there will be more so i do nt know what the fuss is about i m going to buy the season pass now because i know what i m getting and it sounds very reasonable to show us what we are getting to buy in early and get it much cheaper ,d02s6e7,gaming,gaming,1455679628.0,apheix,2.0,0.0,55,1799,0.0
