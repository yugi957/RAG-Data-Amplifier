seems like they re saying kc s lack of game knowledge was too much of a barrier to overcome i wondered if this would be the case sure seems like it would be hard for him to be able to relate to the players and give them advice on a meaningful level if they know he s out of his element compare it to how they received weldon s advice  knowing he has a league background i imagine they ll bring in someone with more familiarity with league as a replacement  although i thought they might just decide jarge would be capable of serving as head coach i guess they want to split up the duties so he can solely focus on ingame strategy  in any case  both sides are being super professional about this  which is good to see ,d02owyn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455674478.0,maff42,2.0,0.0,2.0,55.0,0.0

off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,34.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0

thooorin really managed to hit the nail on the head here while he has questionable knowledge about some of the inner workings of the game  he is very good at extrapolating and referencing his points in making a strong argument  kc was never shown having a strong impact on the players and yes  while we base that on the legends series  why is it after 4 episodes we see nothing of positive consequence when he speaks  while it is not defining of how effective he is as a coach to tsm  it does give a hint towards a certain idea  i think what people fail to recognize is that the current iteration of tsm is not like any of the previous iterations of tsm  which thooorin mentions i think kc would have been a pretty good head coach for tsm of season 5  but he lacks the ability to control as many large voices as currently exist in tsm season 6  also that ending alphadraft plug was gold ,d025mud,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647056.0,mochaderp,2.0,0.0,1.0,2808.0,0.0

i stopped being able to listen when he was using tsm legends as evidence  up until then he was really on point and i do nt mean to trash the video  but come on it s a reality show  it s not reality the bits they re showing us might as well be the players putting on skits in between their real work like  i like reality shows  but you have to take them for what they are  edit  for people who are unclear on what i mean  let me expand in a reality show  you can prompt people into an artificial situation  ie   kc  give a speech to the team so that we can get that on film   and ask them to respond naturally and even though you re asking them to respond naturally  it does nt mean they will continuing that previous example  maybe kc never gives speeches or even if he does  knowing he s preparing it for legends will change how he delivers it the reactions of everyone else are similarly affected maybe they d normally be jumping in and having a discussion  but because this is  kc s speech time for the camera   they let him talk  maybe bjergsen is asked  bjergsen  how do you feel about this   and sometime when he d normally just sit on his opinion  he expresses it and he comes off as a diva  or maybe he is  but we  do nt know    by prompting someone to do something or say something  even if you ask them to do it naturally  you still can get a contrived situation   everyone  greet svenskeren as he comes in  gives you porn level acting   also  reality shows are trying to tell a cohesive story and editing can severely affect how people look usually audiences will underestimate this  but the affect can be really huge if you want  you can edit basically anyone to look any way you want  as long as they ve ever acted this way someone s the nicest person ever except when they re starving  and they were starving twice this week  i can make it look like they re being nasty to their teammates continually or i can make it look like they re the nicest person ever the truth is somewhere in between  on that vein  if kc s been a not perfect  but pretty good coach  and i m not assuming that  but just for example   i can make him look like the best coach ever or the worst  depending on how that fits my story now  tsm legends is nt looking to vilify the players or staff  so they are nt going to make him look like the worst worst  but in trying to tell a very condensed version of the story  some extreme simplifying is going to happen anyway  because there are only 30ish minutes per episode  and a lot of that time is earmarked for game time  player confessionals  team post game analysis  etc   and you can end up thinking  and this is an example to illustrate my point  not actually what people think   wow  kc is lethargic and unenergetic all the time   when the reality could be  continuing that example  that kc is tired in the mornings ,d025h5s,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455646843.0,thewamp,8.0,0.0,2.0,6384.0,0.0
thorin s honestly right about yellowstar  he s not a great laning support  but an amazing team shot caller and captain for regi to say  after bringing in yellowstar himself  that he does nt want one main shot caller for the team is insane that just diminishes yellowstars worth to the team almost entirely honestly  if kasing had stay d with tsm i believe they would nt have started so poorly  and in my prediction i believe yellowstar will leave tsm or they will continue to fail internationally ,d025ztz,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647543.0,d-art12,33.0,0.0,1.0,648.0,0.0
thoorin is pretty much spot on  tsm have probably the best midlander in the nalcs  one of the best adcs in the nalcs  and yellowstar a very good to support and very good captainshotcaller they should think we re gon na work hard  we re gon na work together  and we re gon na fuck up the whole league thoorin is also spot on that there is a difference between channeling ego in positive and negative ways  the thing that i see is that tsm are not utilizing the pieces they have to their maximum effect yellowstar not shotcalling and not captaining is like having hai and not letting him do his thing also  while the macro synergy is getting better  it s still not there  tsm  right now  is like having a swiss army knife and just using one tool  the reason teams work is because people know  understand  and execute their roles tsm do nt really know or understand their roles  and because of that  they ca nt execute those roles  will this fix itself  if they find a good coach that can get everyone on the same page  or the team can solve their problems themselves  then yes saying you re not on the same page is step 1  but there s about 10 steps after that that are more important  including being able to speak frankly to each other without feeling being hurt about whats been going wrong and how to fix it  giving people a clear framework of what they want to do  how they re going to do it  and what everyone s roles in that are  this is ingame stuff  these are the things i see  edit  it s also pretty hilarious that some of you seem to think he wears a coat in all of his video  when if you d watched the video to the end  you ll see thumbnails of some more of his videos  and most of them he s not wearing a coat however  do nt let facts get in the way of your memes  reddit we would nt want that  would we   ,d02e0wa,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455658260.0,TheKiggles,2.0,0.0,1.0,3387.0,0.0

i think the problems threatening the future of league of legends esports scene go deeper than just riot s balance design philosophies  to name a few other things  riot s own game design philosophy as it relates to individual skill is illconducive to a budding esports scene  most egregious example in this regard is the lack of a training mode  sandbox mode as it s been dubbed  and the stated reasoning for that i call this the worst example because they outright endorse an ineffective means of improving as the preferred method to a lesser extent  lack of replays is another example that s often cited being because of technical issues but they ve had years to work through those issues and it this point it s obvious it is nt a priority both sandbox and replays as well as the design philosophies needed to make them a reality would far better facilitate the growth of the esports scene than the current atmosphere they ve fostered  another problem is lol esports  at least in na  is the risk adverse playstyle amongst the teams it s not exciting to watch two teams attempt to wait each other out  to wait for the earliest mistake and end the game on that i m not entirely convinced these players realize their job is to entertain people  unless they do there s not much of a future for league of legends in the esports scene ,d02jrsw,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455666568.0,thebiggiewall,0.0,0.0,63.0,10665.0,0.0

this is a funny quirk of the interaction  the tp and w basically happened at once  which caused the tp to freak out and go on cooldown this only happens if you re really close enough in server ticks  if syndra w s a minion that is already through the tp animation  05 seconds or more   the person will land normally her w does nt actually interfere with tp normally  it will even remove the visual  but the tper will still land it s actually bad to do this because it will make your team think the tp cancelled when it did nt ,d01dm19,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455587026.0,OverlordForte,31.0,0.0,4.0,4124.0,0.0

been playing league since november 2010  i took a break from it last summer and tried other mobas  dota  biggest issue was the difference in mechanics  everything felt noticeably slower because of the turning caused a sense of being disjointed from what was happening on screen  hots  the lack of items killed it for me  did like the emphasis on objective based gameplay but not enough to keep me around  did nt even bother with the others because i went back to league not long after trying dota and hots  i do nt even particularly love league as a whole as much as i like how much more fluid and responsive it feels relative to its competitors ,d02f7sf,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659824.0,thebiggiewall,1.0,0.0,63.0,10665.0,0.0

good article  but i think doublelift is amazingly under rated emily rand mentions how piglet has worse stats in multiple categories than dlift  but he has gotten less helpwhich could nt be less true tsm has put almost no resources into getting doublelift ahead and have played with hauntzer and bjerg getting camped while doublelift consistently gets dove and fucked by the enemy jungler i see a logical reason for keeping him out is his miscommunication and being caught out  but there is no adc in the lcs that has done more with less attention from their team in terms of gank pressure and the team building compositions that are supposed to have them carry this is all while dlift leads his position in damage and his team ,d0294vb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455651772.0,Joolazoo,7.0,0.0,198.0,11869.0,0.0

so a few things that help me  cause i get upset too but have worked on it the new queue system has helped this a ton because now i do nt need to worry about playing something i dont want to play  from best advise and down  1 play to have fun so many people forget this if you re queuing up just to prove to yourself or anyone else that you can do well then you ve got a bigger issue  2 play music and ignore negative comments  3 understand that if you really are a much better player you will eventually get out of the current rank and eventually be placed where you need to be  4 number two is important and while it may seem like you ve wasted 30 mins because you ve lost due to someone incompetence it should be a learning experience becausing losing is inevitable there is no reason to not try and at least make the best of every situation  5 too many times has this game gone from a sure win to an absolute loss giving up at 20 mins is good if you re running low on time but encouraging your team and playing the game out can lead to a wonderful win  6 play with a friend that keeps you in check someone who can calm you or give you direction the game is more fun with friends anyway  7 lastly kills are awesome and they make you feel good when you get them but you re more likely to win if you complete the objectives always have an objective in mind when your top is getting ganked by 5 people then the other 4 people on your team better be pushing lanes or doing dragon  this should all be common advise by now but thought i d type it out cause it helps remind me of whats important anyway  ,d02fbjl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659966.0,savaj,5.0,0.0,14.0,88.0,0.0

i actually think ahri is getting nerfed the wrong way  charm can not cancel dashes anymore   i mean  i know ahri deserves some nerfs  but i do nt think this is a good way to nerf her  actually placing a charm while a dash is part of the potential of outplay  plus  laning against leblanc as ahri is actually already rough  it will totally destroy this lane  i actually think ahri should be more rewarded when hitting her skillshots correctly  her base damage should maybe be nerfed and the old bonus damage applied on charmed target should come back  giving more cd but reseting the cd or half cd if the target gets killed   ahri is a burst mage  or even an assassin  it s normal that she can one burst anyone  but it should happen while playing it correctly  not by spamming w r ignite  i mean  using the charm to cancel a dash is an important part of the gameplay  it punishes other s mistakes and gives counterplay  welp  i made this post most likely to know other s opinion and to share mine i know most of people are a lot salty about ahri  but i think it s understandable that this is not a good way to nerf her  at least  that s what i thought  got ta tag uvertigahri to know your opinion since you re a otp ahri ,464gac,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455655034.0,RivenBadChampKappa,1187.0,0.0,1274.0,5408.0,0.0
this was ahri s tool against fizzleblanccorki removing it will most likely not harm ahri a lot but it will make these champions stronger in the match up  i still ca nt think of a reason why you would nt revert her q movespeed change to the original and give charm the amplification back  but hey  it s not like it was the most obvious way of balancing ahri after the change that made her broken and began the spiral of nerfs rito too stubborn ,d02hhia,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663031.0,Quaggsire,13.0,0.0,92.0,42644.0,0.0
keep in mind ahri is being shaped as more of a kite mage  maybe they think she s too good at kiting with her ms q  three dashes and the ability to interrupt dashes  this is a way of hitting that without just changing the numbers  whether or not it is justified is another conversation but this is i think riot s reasoning ,d02eyla,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659484.0,Honk_If_Top_Comment,2.0,0.0,7.0,244717.0,1.0

disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,341.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to 80 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1812  lux binding 1511  anivia q 128  brand stun 86  leblanc chains 148 and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game ,d02hqy7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663412.0,Kagormund,34.0,0.0,1.0,231.0,0.0

this is so sad actually balance changes that remove core gameplay is questionable why not reduce her base damages and increase scaling  why not just increase the charm cd if it s so problematic ahri gets too much love  in turn too much hate it s not the kit s fault if she has a dedicated player population winrates i think are naturally supposed to go up with more experience with the champ  just punish mistakes and reward good play  do nt go for a halfassed nerf ,d02jvfi,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455666757.0,knlwj,6.0,0.0,1.0,297.0,0.0

this has already been posted before as well as the reproduction steps i tried it and it s hit or miss but if you get the hang of it  you can produce it most of the time what happens is when the portal gets stuck in a wall pushed by a jungle monster  it will summon invisible voidlings every half a second and will go to the nearest lane with high ms small and large visible voidlings will still appear regularly the invisible voidlings will try to follow  and attack  minions but will not do damage nor expire if they do nt have any minions to target  they will clump to the nearest turret or inhibitor  blocking it effectively that your melee minions ca nt even attack it  successfully doing it one time can block a few minions but doing it more than twice can block an entire lane if the enemy inhibitor is down  invisible voidlings might even block the spawn areas and in some occasions spread on other lanes  when coming from mid  of course you can do this on other lanes to start with  ,d01sspe,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455624014.0,necromimi,71.0,0.0,1693.0,1585.0,0.0

biggest change for me when i played hots after playing lol for years was not buying items i couldnt get over it idk why but it made the game feel simple and characters were only allowed one role or so it felt when i played at release have nt gone back they have recommended builds but i would also recommend looking them up for the current season all of the 450 champs are pretty decent especially poppy she was recently reworked so i d recommend getting them first do not buy runes until you re sumoner level 20 and can buy tier 3 runes otherwise you re wasting ip  influence points you gain from games   another thing is lanes i dont recall lanes being much of a thing in hots  but the na meta rn is a solo top lane which is generally a tankybruiser charecter with a jungle also will most likely be tankybruiser but they do have assassin jungles as well  then you got solo mid which is generally a ranged ap champ finally on bottom you got 2 champs 1  adc  attack damage carry  theyre job is to get fed and stack a bunch of ad  attack speed and crit chance the other on bottom is the support  generally a champ with good crowd control or healing abilities  or both  sorry for wall of text i can just think of a lot of little tips for someone starting ,d01r3dg,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455617183.0,daogrande,8.0,0.0,309.0,1071.0,0.0

i posted this as a comment on the actual page but figured i could put it here as well  having attended msi last year i am glad about some of the changes   double round robin format taking away the bluered side bias  extending the group stage to more days  last year having 15 matches in 2 days was crazy  and it ran so late locally we did not get to have meet and greets most days the change to having 30 matches in 5 days basically means that we are having 25 less matches a day   splitting the semifinal matches into separate days is also a smart idea as most people left or the crowd was dead last year after the sktvsfnatic semifinal  the only thing that worries me is the extended time  last year msi ended and 10 days later lck started  if they expect teams to compete and then 3 days later start their summer split  i could see some of the top tier teams choosing not to go  edit  formatting,d02s9gl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455679767.0,James179,2.0,0.0,1.0,42.0,0.0

i started to play lol after about 2000 games of hots  and jaina was my most played hero in ranked  i hate artanis though   so we re in similar positions  here s what i can tell you   the champions in lol are more complex than the heroes in hots  in general   and there are a lot more of them this means it will take you a lot longer to get to the point where you can counter play effectively you ll probably feel quite lost in your first games due to the sheer amount of gamechampion knowledge that you re still lacking   you might be disappointed in how most matches unfold compared to hots hots has a more modern design  you spend more time of the game doing interesting stuff compared to lol there are 10 different maps  which keeps the game experience diversified and fresh in league of legends you ll find that most matches amount to a laning phase followed by a very drawn out team fight in the mid lane this is not true for higher ranked games  but you wo nt be in high ranked games for a  long  time in other words  you might actually be very disappointed by that aspect of lol  overall flow of the game    related to the above  league of legends  like dota  has a  laning phase  which is usually at least 15 minutes long  and that you spend farming gold from minions  and trying to outplay your lane opponent  s   only  very  very rarely  are these first 15 minutes of the game more interesting than the first 15 minutes of a hots game  hots games only last 20 minutes on average   and you have to do it in every game  regarding your specific question  jaina is a backline damage dealer that depends a lot on good positioning and clever application of your crowd control artanis is your typical tanky melee bruiser  with that in mind  you ll probably enjoy morgana  lux  orianna  leblanc morgana and lux are both good because you can play them solo in the mid lane and as support champions in the bot lane  artanis corresponds to champions like fiora  riven  volibear  malphite  hecarim  shyvana  who are tanky and still capable of dealing damage  unfortunately it s not easy to compare lol and hots in this fashion  because the games are designed quite differently  and so are the heroes  i like to play tanks in hots  because it gives me a lot of control over team fights  but in lol i do nt really care about that  because full blown team fights are more rare  and tanks play differently  so at the end of the day you have to try out all roles and enough champions to find out for yourself  you should also refer to the following sources for information   championgg  the league of legends wiki  youtube and twitch to be honest i find most of the guide websites pretty bad  the average quality of the guides is low there are good ones but you wo nt find them easily while you still need them ,d01u141,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455627816.0,siggboy,56.0,0.0,1.0,84.0,0.0

not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,608.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0

i still think it s a huge mistake to fire a coach who has only been with the org for a few months just because he is nt up to par yet if that is literally the only reason he was being let go then why are the players also not being let go  they definitely had nt been performing to expectation until their game against clg  which still was nt mind blowing  makes me wonder if this was nt another instance of regi trying to step in too much and undermining the authority of kc there s a reason the owners of traditional sports are nt involved in the coaching of the team at all or it could be the players  having no background in traditional sports  got their ego s bruised a bit by the coaching methods that kc brought and tucked their tails and went to papa regi or  he could have legit just been bad at his job as the announcement implies  i think the most likely scenario is that it was a combination of all of those situations  but i m not privy to any inside information  he could have stolen leena s candy bar for all i know  i do want to reiterate  regi should not  in any way  be involved in the coaching of the team if he wants his players to respect a hired coach he should either coach the team  or own the team if you ve hired someone to coach  let them coach if they become ineffective  fire them  hire a new coach  but do not step in and undermine their authority ,d02rffn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455678400.0,Darktire,1.0,0.0,29.0,7632.0,0.0

unfortunately  if you can not hold back from typing negative things that are nt constructive in game  there s not much to do aside from stop typing  which you said you do nt like doing  biggest thing i d recommend is that you should try to recognize that a  in every scenario  in every situation that goes badly  where you might try to chat to attack or belittle your teammates  instead try to rethink the situation into a  what more could i have done there   rather than  what more could they have done there    it helps you shift frustration into a learning tool  and redirects potential anger you have towards teammates towards yourself or the game if you do this  you can make negative experiences into somewhat helpful learning experiences  b  unless you phrase your comments very specifically  your chat wo nt be seen as criticisms  but rather as just insults the easiest way to get less toxic when you chat to other players is that you work on how you say things understand that if you see a teammate die 4 times in a row top lane against riven  you saying  you fucking suck stop feeding  does nt accomplish anything at all instead  do nt make reference to how bad they are doing  but give a criticism or advice all the same  something along the lines of  hey  you should play more passively and build armor  and just sit tight so riven does nt snowball anymore   c  you need to be more humble  less proud  in game this one is usually the hardest for toxic players to accomplish because they typically view themselves as superior to their fellow players  and it causes you to react in a way that you feel the need to control or influence the game more than you are by just playing your champion trust me on this one  if you can change your mindset in game from  these idiots suck  why ca nt i get good teammtes  to  these guys are having bad games  and there is nt much i can do to stop that aside from playing well  from  they re doing these obviously bad plays that i would never make  to  i ca nt play for them  so i should just do as good as i can and help if they need it  from  i know what they are doing wrong and they should stop doing said thing  to  they probably know that they are doing poorly  i should just do my best and move on  in every scenario  you should be focusing on yourself and how you play  and recognize that chatting negatively wo nt help at all if you change your viewpoint  no matter what  seriously  to  i m the only person i should be criticizing  it not only improves your play  it helps reduce the negativity you feel and act on in game ,d02g9ch,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455661280.0,walkur1005,2.0,0.0,227.0,194.0,0.0

this is why  generally speaking  teams  in traditional sports  pickfind a coach and have the coach build the team in the usual case of a team already existing  they let the coach make roster decisions if the coach handpicks the players  you have someone to goto when things are nt working out because of the simple fact that the coach built the team not every coach will work well with certain players and obviously  tsm was nt going to let kc get rid ofreplace players on their team it can be difficult to fit in a coach that works with such strong personalities that are in tsm hopefully tsm can find a new coach before katowice and all the best to kc ,d022we2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643325.0,tjfllo,2.0,0.0,756.0,4870.0,0.0

imo  the way to nerf ahri is buffing the power of her skillshots while nerfing the power of her w and r when i started to get into ahri i was shocked by how unreliant she actually is on hitting her skillshots what  should  be a high skillcap champion can just bum rush an adc with r while spamming w with 40  cdr and just assassinate them without using any other spells  without any room for outplay on the victim s part unless they can burst her down faster than she bursts them down  which is really fast  even without skillshots   add ignite to the mix for more brainless  nonskillshot burst  ahri mains will always circle jerk that she s hard to play and you need to good at hitting skillshots to be good at ahri while you do need to be good with skillshots to get the best out of her  as someone who s awful at them  i can testify to the fact that you absolutely do nt need it to get results on ahri   http  iimgurcomtmkvcappng   i love playing her for that reason but it s also awful to play against and highly counterintuitive when her kit was clearly meant to require her to hit her skillshots to do well  rather than just being an additional reward while her w and r are already more than enough on their own in so many situations  i think her r is basically fine  on its own it s not a problem  the main reason it looks like an issue is that the gap closing is such an easy enabler for her w  which is the real problem imo w requires a nerf to either the damage or the cooldown  or a mix of both making it harder to assassinate targets with 23 r charges and 2 w s makes it more important for her to be able to land her skillshots  one or both of which can receive small buffs to help keep her overall power the same  so long as you re playing mechanically well and not just mashing r and w in the general direction of the person you want to kill  my thoughts on riot s nerf is that it s strange to nerf one of her skillshots rather than hitting her unhealthy gameplay pattern  but the nerf itself actually does make a lot of sense all things considered  it s not a displacement cc so it should nt cancel out dashes i do nt think they re aiming to directly nerf ahri s power with that change as much as they re just trying to make their game more consistent but i think ahri  is  a champion they should take a closer look at  she really needs some power shifts in her kit ,d02mhwd,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455670797.0,VaporaDark,5.0,0.0,975.0,9420.0,0.0
