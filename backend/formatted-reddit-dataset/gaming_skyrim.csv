the elder scrolls  dominion  takes place in the entire aldmeri dominion main plots would involve the build up for the next great war and the imperial attempts to sabotage the military build up may take place concurrently or shortly after skyrim  with only vague references to the  troubles in skyrim  importantly the goals and ideologies of the members of the dominion would be presented in a positive light  with emphasis on how everybody is actually pretty happy  and the economy seems to be booming of course there will be drawbacks  like some racism and maybe the occasional secret police raids  but most common citizens will feel that it s worth it of course the imperial agents  maybe some of them blades or penitus oculatus  will be shown as cutthroat  paranoid agents who will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals  there would be a quest line to combat the imperials or to help sabotage the dominion  though you may be able to do both  the thieves guild may be based in elsweyr  the fighters guild could be a mercenary group that is taking care of policing while the army prepares for war  the mages guild could be a research lab for the war effort  or just a regular college  the assassins guild could be made up of some surviving dark brotherhood members  maybe even some that were presumed dead by cicero  important mechanics would be in game consequences for your actions oh  you helped imperial agents destroy the mill  now the khajit that ran the place is in the street begging for money because he ca nt afford the repairs oh  killed the spy that was bothering that shopkeeper  now she ll happily sell you better goods at lower prices  or maybe offer an alternative solution to a tricky quest oh  you did nt kill the thief that you caught while on patrol with the mercenaries  every bandit hideout now has an extra enemy for a few days oh  you  did  kill that thief  now the thieves guild thinks they ve been crossed and wants you to find out who s betraying them  in this game you have to think about who your actions will affect in the whole world and question whether this is really what you want ,d01h753,skyrim,gaming,1455592656,RedDemocracy,10,0,1,1986,0.0

a lot of the time we remove posts from this subreddit  we the mods are often met with various behaviors that normal people would find unacceptable  despite our rules being clearly labeled on our side bar so instead  i m making this post to clarify a couple things and highlight our rules  which are as follows  1   please read the  skyrim faq   https  wwwredditcomrskyrimwikiindex  before you post    this is a good way to start the faq outlines several commonly asked questions and also highlights certain threads that contain good information  such as  what mods should i get   and system info  among other things  2   slurs and personal attacks will be met with an immediate ban    anything that can be construed as a personal attack or slur  even in jest  is not allowed in skyrim  in the last hour  i ve banned 10 people   http  iimgurcomvoxjgoepng  for varying degrees of personal attacks  and it s easy for me  because all i have to do it press a button and then read someone telling me to go fuck myself we have 4 pages of bans  and i do nt mind adding to it  so behave yourselves and if you see someone telling someone else to kill themselves or something similar  report it  3   mods reserve the right to remove posts and ban users at their discretion    see rule 2  4   no memes  no rage comics  no unrelated material    the first two are self explanatory instead  i will be explaining what constitutes unrelated material   pictures of real life that remind you of skyrim   hand prints   anything that is nt a screenshot of skyrim  art someone made of skyrim  or direct cosplay  including crafts  from skyrim   sweetrolls   screenshots or images with memelike text or captions   piracy  where to pirate the game  etc   begging for someone to gift you the game go fuck off   etc   on the topic of reposts    get over it there are 316379 subscribed users on rskyrim  and if rpics  user count of 9942242 subscribers is any indication of how many people are registered on this site  that means that only 318  of all of reddit normally sees posts on rskyrim  and i highly doubt that all 316379 of you see every single post made here  if anyone has questions or wants to get banned  please say so ,3tlzza,skyrim,gaming,1448051903,MaxLemon,230,0,3002,26049,0.0

  magic resistance   is capped at 85   elemental resistance is also capped at 85   but it is calculated separately from magic resistance  so you can stack  say  fire resistance on top of magic resistance however  in this case  elemental resistance is calculated as percentage of the damage not blocked by the magic resistance for instance  if i have 80  magic resistance and 20  fire resistance  that does nt mean i resist 100  of fire damage it means i resist 80  of fire damage  plus 20  of the remaining 20  that is nt taken care of by my magic resistance so stacking a 20  fire resistance item or potion on top of 80  magic resistance only yields an extra 4  resistance to fire  for 84  total on the other hand  you can stack capped elemental resistance on top of capped magic resistance  so that you resist 9775  of each spell  85  magic resistance  and 85  of the remaining 15      spell cost   can be reduced to zero with sufficiently high enchanting skill but you can only do this for two magic schools  since the most you can get on a single item is a 25  cost reduction  and you can only put two enchantments on each item also note that the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from enchanting is different from the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from potions having  say  an amulet with 20  fortify destruction reduces your spell cost by 20   but a potion that grants 20  fortify destruction increases your spell damage by 20   there are nt gear pieces that improve your enchanting  because there is no fortify enchanting enchantment  only fortify enchanting potions but this can still be used for   maximizing enchantment power    check out  this brief guide   http  wwwuespnetwikiskyrim  enchanting  maximizing_enchantment_power  on the wiki the basic idea is to get a kind of feedback loop going between fortify enchanting potions and fortify alchemy enchantments  brief a fortify enchanting potion  then make a fortify alchemy enchantment while under that potion s effects  which you can use to make an even more powerful fortify enchanting potion  and so on however  the most powerful fortify enchanting potion you re going to be able to make no matter what is somewhere between 40  50   depending on what patches you re using ,d012h14,skyrim,gaming,1455569797,Grundlage,2,0,27,1317,0.0

the concept of an illusion mage really speaks to me  however bethesda could ve done so much more with it then what they did  it s basically 4 basic spells that get stronger from novice to master and then master spells that are also the same except they get an area of effect and then you also get muffle and invisibility  so in my opinion you really only get 6 spells which  after a while  is very boring to play with  is there any mod that revamps the illusion spells ,45xzwc,skyrim,gaming,1455562255,Virark,2,0,160,508,0.0

i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,d01bg2z,skyrim,gaming,1455583606,sloogz,10,0,337,4059,0.0

a lot of the time we remove posts from this subreddit  we the mods are often met with various behaviors that normal people would find unacceptable  despite our rules being clearly labeled on our side bar so instead  i m making this post to clarify a couple things and highlight our rules  which are as follows  1   please read the  skyrim faq   https  wwwredditcomrskyrimwikiindex  before you post    this is a good way to start the faq outlines several commonly asked questions and also highlights certain threads that contain good information  such as  what mods should i get   and system info  among other things  2   slurs and personal attacks will be met with an immediate ban    anything that can be construed as a personal attack or slur  even in jest  is not allowed in skyrim  in the last hour  i ve banned 10 people   http  iimgurcomvoxjgoepng  for varying degrees of personal attacks  and it s easy for me  because all i have to do it press a button and then read someone telling me to go fuck myself we have 4 pages of bans  and i do nt mind adding to it  so behave yourselves and if you see someone telling someone else to kill themselves or something similar  report it  3   mods reserve the right to remove posts and ban users at their discretion    see rule 2  4   no memes  no rage comics  no unrelated material    the first two are self explanatory instead  i will be explaining what constitutes unrelated material   pictures of real life that remind you of skyrim   hand prints   anything that is nt a screenshot of skyrim  art someone made of skyrim  or direct cosplay  including crafts  from skyrim   sweetrolls   screenshots or images with memelike text or captions   piracy  where to pirate the game  etc   begging for someone to gift you the game go fuck off   etc   on the topic of reposts    get over it there are 316379 subscribed users on rskyrim  and if rpics  user count of 9942242 subscribers is any indication of how many people are registered on this site  that means that only 318  of all of reddit normally sees posts on rskyrim  and i highly doubt that all 316379 of you see every single post made here  if anyone has questions or wants to get banned  please say so ,3tlzza,skyrim,gaming,1448051903,MaxLemon,230,0,3002,26049,0.0

oh man  i ll give you the run down on how to level quick and make a lot of gold in the process you ll need to delve into dungeons to get started as well as keep this going  so you should nt get too bored  first and foremost  some rules  1  whenever you see any weapon or armor or ring that is enchanted  pocket it and disenchant it at an altar so you can enchant other weapons with its effects  2  grab all soul gems you see  3  any iron  silver or gold oreingot pocket it as well 4  do nt buy anything except ingots and ores they are sold at blacksmiths whiterun is ideal because there are 3 people you can buy from  first  you ll want to go north of whiterun to halted stream camp there is a ton of iron mines there  and an awesome spell called transmute this take iron ore and turns it into silvergold ore this makes your smithing increase more than iron would do  buy as much iron ingot and ore and make iron daggers and jewelry and then sell them off  a huge thing here that will change both your money and leveling drastically is to find a weapon that has soul trap on it  disenchant it and then use a soul gem to enchant a bowcrossbow with soul trap  since you likely are low level you ll only encounter petty and lesser soul gems fill these by walking around the whiterun plains and killing deer  mudcrabs  etc with your bow  now that you have a lot of filled soul gems  go make some daggers and jewelry  and then enchant them all with whatever enchantment and then sell them this will get you quite a bit of money  all while leveling enchanting and smithing you can now afford even more iron ingot to make more daggers to rinse and repeat  if you have the dawn guard expansion  the soul cairn is full of soul gems ripe for the taking if you are running low on them just go and restock  after you ve leveled your smithing a bit you ll want to unlock the dwarven smithing dwarven ingot is by far the most common and easy to stockpile in the game they are all found in dwarven ruins  and dwarven ingot can be smelted from many dwarven scrap metal you find lying around there  make dwarven bows  enchant  sell  some other tips  you can level conjuration easily by finding a mud crab and just recasting a summon spell like  conjure sword   it levels very fast the reason being is that you must be in combat to level conjuration  and the summon sword spell wo nt kill the mudcrab as long as you do nt attack it  also  you do nt need to specialize in skyrim  you can really do anything g with any character you want to focus on health and magic for your character  i d say your stamina should never go above 200 points unless you are very high level  the solitude blacksmith also has a ton of iron  steel  and silver ingot for you to loot just do nt get caught ,d023j98,skyrim,gaming,1455644191,hks9,11,0,94,17344,0.0

leveling up enchanting  alchemy and smithing is something that happens  very gradually  over the course of your playthrough unless you spend all your time mining and getting the money to buy soul gems  you ll be around level 40 before you can smith ebony  if you want to speed up enchanting  use conjuration and focus on using bound weapons  as i believe a perk allows bound weapons to put a soul into an empty soul gem  you do nt  need  anything to play on a higher difficulty  i m personally on a level 93 legendary run   just the willpower not to turn it down use restoration to keep your health up  dodge more  etc ,d020lck,skyrim,gaming,1455640056,shit-I-justfuckedup,1,0,2110,2624,0.0
you level up enchanting  alchemy  and smithing by enchanting stuff  brewing potions  and making weaponsarmor one of the best things about skyrim in my opinion is that skills level up as you use them so if you want to make stupidly powerful potions  you ll start with relatively weak potions  and gradually get stronger as you obtain perks and skill levels  alternatively  you can just find trainers for the skills pretty sure there s an enchanting trainer in the college of winterhold ,d0235p6,skyrim,gaming,1455643679,illkillyouwitharake,1,0,255,2696,0.0
1  do not start a new character just shift gears  2  mages have weaker dps than the physdmg builds  3  even with cheating you will find it hard to make a hi dps mage 4  see the uesp pages for great leveling advice  5  do not play higher than adept difficulty until you learn everything you need to know  6  always follow the fun  ie let your personality do what it wants  7  see my recent post  about mage builds  and read the 4 physdmg builds and go for the one that best suits your personality if you like dps then any of those 4 builds will make you very happy you wanted a ranged dps mage so might i suggest that you immediately shift gears to sneaksniper  which is the single best ranged dps in the game  hope this helps ,d027fzq,skyrim,gaming,1455649494,Riitoken,1,0,1,-71,0.0

i need a satisfying skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller on a pc  i ve got a level 90 nord male with all perk trees at 100 i ve got all the black books so i can reconfigure perks at will i have a good gaming pc with an xbox 360 controller my problem right now is that i simply can not find a gratifying mage build and i ve tried more than a few ideas  satisfying is a relative concept for each gamer so let me offer my current frame of reference before you reply below i only describe the major chapters of my skyrim career by build                                           heavyarmor twohanded warrior i started playing on novice mode  during early learning curve  using heavy armor and twohanded build  somewhere around level 10 it got boring easy so i bumped to apprentice until i finished the main quest line  first thing  then bumped up to adept during this build i got to see more than a few of the coup de gras cut scenes  very satisfying my final build was legendary dragonplate with a legendary dragon bone hammer with healthstam regen enchants this is a very easy way to play i could easily rush 2 giants and 2 mammoths with maybe only a single health potion having satisified myself with this build i turned to an assassin build   lightarmor dagger assassin i turned to the dark brotherhood questlines and i donned all the best sneak armor i d collected along the way  wielding two dragonbone daggers  legendary   my sneak was already near to 100  and i went out at night to test drive my newb assassin build by my lakeside house and my very first kill was sneaking a vampire in the open dark of night and i got the 15x dagger backstab cut scene throat slice and i was blown away  absolutely fantastic badass gaming experience  my actual thought was this game just let me assassinate a vampire at night     during this time  i would always grab my two hander to deal with random dragons merely to save on potions because i could put any dragon down in two hits before any serious damage but with the daggers not so easy i easily completed all brotherhood quests and was very satisfied with this build   sneak sniper i decided that i wanted to experience dragon slaying without the twohander so i turned to my dragon bone bow  legendary  and trained archery full 100 and ran all the thieves guild quests and it was insane like shooting drunken comatose ducks in a pond this was the first moment i really felt like i was cheating even though i was not although i usually did need a potion or two  i could put down any random dragon with my bow typical potion sequence was a 55  magic resist and a single full health  i finished all the thieves guild quest lines this way it was great and the cut kill scenes with the flying arrows are very satisfying   zerker dual wield i still did not have lightarmor max d because sneaking is such that you rarely get hit and thus you do nt train in addition  onehanded was not max d because daggers and bows do nt count so i turned my attention to a lightarmor  dragonscale legendary  dual wield dragonbone dagger left hand and dragonbone mace right hand  both legendary   and i started clearing my very bloated quest log and chasing all the shouts and dragonborn content i ca nt say enough about this build  it is bleeping fantastic this is the only build that will let you literally sprint all the way thru any dungeon  or anywhere   i ve got enchanting max d so my dagger has stamina regen and soultrap and the mace has stamina regen and paralyze i can literally rush every target and beat it senseless in 12 seconds  including a legendary dragon  sometimes hardly ever getting hit most of the damage taken is from mages at range for me  zerkersprinting combat on legendary difficulty is a serious adrenaline rush i highly recommend the experience it is the most satisfying of each of the major 4 builds i ve described so far   note  i finished both the werewolf and vampire skill trees just to get the achievement but the gameplay was just a gimmick novelty and no where near as good as any of the 4 builds above   mage build     wtf         so once i decided i could not minmax my zerker build better  i finally turned my attention to a mage build i began by training all the 5 schools to 100 and completing all 5 of the college ritual quests so now i m the archmage with 100 s in all 5 trees and all the black books  and all shouts and powers  and i can not find any build that is even remotely close to satisfying it is not that there are not enough spells or that they do nt do some cool stuff  there are plenty of spells and cool fx   but rather that i simply can not find only 2 spells that i can wield such that i can solo an entire dungeon easily with an xbox 360 controller on a pc  so my question for all of you is to simply ask you to tell me how to enjoy a skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller and 2 spells  as far as i know i have every kind of item that can benefit a mage  but i ca nt get thru a dungeon without needing 510 spells and that reduces the skyrim mage experience to a big game of popup menu  not fun in the least   note that it is entirely ok to suggest that this is impossible because if it is then i want to know that it is so i do nt waste any more time i ll go back to my legendary zerker   edit  i failed to mention that i made a cheater ring with 3 million magicka  so spell cost is not an issue but even with this god level cheat  i still can not find a satisfying 2spell mage build and my current assessment is this  the magic system is not playable with only 2 spells this is why physical damage builds have value  because they are   playable   and that playability matters ,460da1,skyrim,gaming,1455590867,Riitoken,0,0,1,-71,0.0

gt  how do i level up things  this  for me  is one of the brilliant aspects of skyrim as you do a thing  you improve so  if you smith a lot  your smithing improves if you practice your alchemy  you learn what works and your level goes up if you fight with magic  that skill gets stronger  or onehanded weapons  or archery the more you use a skill  the better you get ,d01yrbr,skyrim,gaming,1455637293,1_Marauder,40,0,22078,19520,0.0
i ve found that in order to get the most of skyrim  you need to play the most interactive playstyles good example is swordamp  shield  which makes you time your attacks around your opponent s and maximizeminimize damage least entertaining playstyles to me are dualwielding anything  daggers  axes  swords  destruction  etc   this is because you just have to evade attacks and then spam the attack button sneak archer is somewhere in between where you still have to be careful  but there s often no fight  also  what platform are you on  if pc  i highly suggest modding it gets a bad rap because of the ridiculous stuff  but there s plenty of good ones that just spice things up a bit ,d0220fu,skyrim,gaming,1455642071,FarazR2,1,0,37,10622,0.0

try mixing things up with conjuration  restoration and alteration makes a mage build far more fun  smithing is easy just buy a bunch of leather and leather strips from a shop and then skip two days ahead using the time changer function  which should restock the materials  and do it over and over til you reach 100  for enchanting  mine a bunch of ore  smelt them  craft a bunch of jewelry  which could help with levelling smithing as well if you have nt fully completed levelling it  and then go to dawnstar  find the dawnstar chest  it s near a mining cave iirc watch a video on the dawnstar chest glitch since it s too well hidden to accurately pinpoint the location using text  which has a significant amount of soul gems and gold which you should loot  then go to the khaijit caravan  if they do nt show up  change the time until they do  right outside dawnstar  talk to atahbah and if her gold is at 1250 that means the chest reset  and if it is nt on 1250  just save your game  attack her  then load the save and her gold should reset to 1250 which means the chest has reset as well go back to the chest and then rince and repeat  alchemy takes a long time go to the es wiki  find all the recipes  and then get the ingredients via buying them or just finding them  you can find their locations in the wiki as well  and then create them until you reach 100 alchemy  ps  you have to complete the thieves guild mission regarding caravans to unlock atahbah as a fence try doing the enchanting thing when you progress a little further in the game ,d01yw22,skyrim,gaming,1455637503,KnightsofKnightobia,14,0,1,-7,0.0

oh man  i ll give you the run down on how to level quick and make a lot of gold in the process you ll need to delve into dungeons to get started as well as keep this going  so you should nt get too bored  first and foremost  some rules  1  whenever you see any weapon or armor or ring that is enchanted  pocket it and disenchant it at an altar so you can enchant other weapons with its effects  2  grab all soul gems you see  3  any iron  silver or gold oreingot pocket it as well 4  do nt buy anything except ingots and ores they are sold at blacksmiths whiterun is ideal because there are 3 people you can buy from  first  you ll want to go north of whiterun to halted stream camp there is a ton of iron mines there  and an awesome spell called transmute this take iron ore and turns it into silvergold ore this makes your smithing increase more than iron would do  buy as much iron ingot and ore and make iron daggers and jewelry and then sell them off  a huge thing here that will change both your money and leveling drastically is to find a weapon that has soul trap on it  disenchant it and then use a soul gem to enchant a bowcrossbow with soul trap  since you likely are low level you ll only encounter petty and lesser soul gems fill these by walking around the whiterun plains and killing deer  mudcrabs  etc with your bow  now that you have a lot of filled soul gems  go make some daggers and jewelry  and then enchant them all with whatever enchantment and then sell them this will get you quite a bit of money  all while leveling enchanting and smithing you can now afford even more iron ingot to make more daggers to rinse and repeat  if you have the dawn guard expansion  the soul cairn is full of soul gems ripe for the taking if you are running low on them just go and restock  after you ve leveled your smithing a bit you ll want to unlock the dwarven smithing dwarven ingot is by far the most common and easy to stockpile in the game they are all found in dwarven ruins  and dwarven ingot can be smelted from many dwarven scrap metal you find lying around there  make dwarven bows  enchant  sell  some other tips  you can level conjuration easily by finding a mud crab and just recasting a summon spell like  conjure sword   it levels very fast the reason being is that you must be in combat to level conjuration  and the summon sword spell wo nt kill the mudcrab as long as you do nt attack it  also  you do nt need to specialize in skyrim  you can really do anything g with any character you want to focus on health and magic for your character  i d say your stamina should never go above 200 points unless you are very high level  the solitude blacksmith also has a ton of iron  steel  and silver ingot for you to loot just do nt get caught ,d023j98,skyrim,gaming,1455644191,hks9,11,0,94,17344,0.0

try mixing things up with conjuration  restoration and alteration makes a mage build far more fun  smithing is easy just buy a bunch of leather and leather strips from a shop and then skip two days ahead using the time changer function  which should restock the materials  and do it over and over til you reach 100  for enchanting  mine a bunch of ore  smelt them  craft a bunch of jewelry  which could help with levelling smithing as well if you have nt fully completed levelling it  and then go to dawnstar  find the dawnstar chest  it s near a mining cave iirc watch a video on the dawnstar chest glitch since it s too well hidden to accurately pinpoint the location using text  which has a significant amount of soul gems and gold which you should loot  then go to the khaijit caravan  if they do nt show up  change the time until they do  right outside dawnstar  talk to atahbah and if her gold is at 1250 that means the chest reset  and if it is nt on 1250  just save your game  attack her  then load the save and her gold should reset to 1250 which means the chest has reset as well go back to the chest and then rince and repeat  alchemy takes a long time go to the es wiki  find all the recipes  and then get the ingredients via buying them or just finding them  you can find their locations in the wiki as well  and then create them until you reach 100 alchemy  ps  you have to complete the thieves guild mission regarding caravans to unlock atahbah as a fence try doing the enchanting thing when you progress a little further in the game ,d01yw22,skyrim,gaming,1455637503,KnightsofKnightobia,14,0,1,-7,0.0

leveling up enchanting  alchemy and smithing is something that happens  very gradually  over the course of your playthrough unless you spend all your time mining and getting the money to buy soul gems  you ll be around level 40 before you can smith ebony  if you want to speed up enchanting  use conjuration and focus on using bound weapons  as i believe a perk allows bound weapons to put a soul into an empty soul gem  you do nt  need  anything to play on a higher difficulty  i m personally on a level 93 legendary run   just the willpower not to turn it down use restoration to keep your health up  dodge more  etc ,d020lck,skyrim,gaming,1455640056,shit-I-justfuckedup,1,0,2110,2624,0.0

you level up enchanting  alchemy  and smithing by enchanting stuff  brewing potions  and making weaponsarmor one of the best things about skyrim in my opinion is that skills level up as you use them so if you want to make stupidly powerful potions  you ll start with relatively weak potions  and gradually get stronger as you obtain perks and skill levels  alternatively  you can just find trainers for the skills pretty sure there s an enchanting trainer in the college of winterhold ,d0235p6,skyrim,gaming,1455643679,illkillyouwitharake,1,0,255,2696,0.0

1  do not start a new character just shift gears  2  mages have weaker dps than the physdmg builds  3  even with cheating you will find it hard to make a hi dps mage 4  see the uesp pages for great leveling advice  5  do not play higher than adept difficulty until you learn everything you need to know  6  always follow the fun  ie let your personality do what it wants  7  see my recent post  about mage builds  and read the 4 physdmg builds and go for the one that best suits your personality if you like dps then any of those 4 builds will make you very happy you wanted a ranged dps mage so might i suggest that you immediately shift gears to sneaksniper  which is the single best ranged dps in the game  hope this helps ,d027fzq,skyrim,gaming,1455649494,Riitoken,1,0,1,-71,0.0

i need a satisfying skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller on a pc  i ve got a level 90 nord male with all perk trees at 100 i ve got all the black books so i can reconfigure perks at will i have a good gaming pc with an xbox 360 controller my problem right now is that i simply can not find a gratifying mage build and i ve tried more than a few ideas  satisfying is a relative concept for each gamer so let me offer my current frame of reference before you reply below i only describe the major chapters of my skyrim career by build                                           heavyarmor twohanded warrior i started playing on novice mode  during early learning curve  using heavy armor and twohanded build  somewhere around level 10 it got boring easy so i bumped to apprentice until i finished the main quest line  first thing  then bumped up to adept during this build i got to see more than a few of the coup de gras cut scenes  very satisfying my final build was legendary dragonplate with a legendary dragon bone hammer with healthstam regen enchants this is a very easy way to play i could easily rush 2 giants and 2 mammoths with maybe only a single health potion having satisified myself with this build i turned to an assassin build   lightarmor dagger assassin i turned to the dark brotherhood questlines and i donned all the best sneak armor i d collected along the way  wielding two dragonbone daggers  legendary   my sneak was already near to 100  and i went out at night to test drive my newb assassin build by my lakeside house and my very first kill was sneaking a vampire in the open dark of night and i got the 15x dagger backstab cut scene throat slice and i was blown away  absolutely fantastic badass gaming experience  my actual thought was this game just let me assassinate a vampire at night     during this time  i would always grab my two hander to deal with random dragons merely to save on potions because i could put any dragon down in two hits before any serious damage but with the daggers not so easy i easily completed all brotherhood quests and was very satisfied with this build   sneak sniper i decided that i wanted to experience dragon slaying without the twohander so i turned to my dragon bone bow  legendary  and trained archery full 100 and ran all the thieves guild quests and it was insane like shooting drunken comatose ducks in a pond this was the first moment i really felt like i was cheating even though i was not although i usually did need a potion or two  i could put down any random dragon with my bow typical potion sequence was a 55  magic resist and a single full health  i finished all the thieves guild quest lines this way it was great and the cut kill scenes with the flying arrows are very satisfying   zerker dual wield i still did not have lightarmor max d because sneaking is such that you rarely get hit and thus you do nt train in addition  onehanded was not max d because daggers and bows do nt count so i turned my attention to a lightarmor  dragonscale legendary  dual wield dragonbone dagger left hand and dragonbone mace right hand  both legendary   and i started clearing my very bloated quest log and chasing all the shouts and dragonborn content i ca nt say enough about this build  it is bleeping fantastic this is the only build that will let you literally sprint all the way thru any dungeon  or anywhere   i ve got enchanting max d so my dagger has stamina regen and soultrap and the mace has stamina regen and paralyze i can literally rush every target and beat it senseless in 12 seconds  including a legendary dragon  sometimes hardly ever getting hit most of the damage taken is from mages at range for me  zerkersprinting combat on legendary difficulty is a serious adrenaline rush i highly recommend the experience it is the most satisfying of each of the major 4 builds i ve described so far   note  i finished both the werewolf and vampire skill trees just to get the achievement but the gameplay was just a gimmick novelty and no where near as good as any of the 4 builds above   mage build     wtf         so once i decided i could not minmax my zerker build better  i finally turned my attention to a mage build i began by training all the 5 schools to 100 and completing all 5 of the college ritual quests so now i m the archmage with 100 s in all 5 trees and all the black books  and all shouts and powers  and i can not find any build that is even remotely close to satisfying it is not that there are not enough spells or that they do nt do some cool stuff  there are plenty of spells and cool fx   but rather that i simply can not find only 2 spells that i can wield such that i can solo an entire dungeon easily with an xbox 360 controller on a pc  so my question for all of you is to simply ask you to tell me how to enjoy a skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller and 2 spells  as far as i know i have every kind of item that can benefit a mage  but i ca nt get thru a dungeon without needing 510 spells and that reduces the skyrim mage experience to a big game of popup menu  not fun in the least   note that it is entirely ok to suggest that this is impossible because if it is then i want to know that it is so i do nt waste any more time i ll go back to my legendary zerker   edit  i failed to mention that i made a cheater ring with 3 million magicka  so spell cost is not an issue but even with this god level cheat  i still can not find a satisfying 2spell mage build and my current assessment is this  the magic system is not playable with only 2 spells this is why physical damage builds have value  because they are   playable   and that playability matters ,460da1,skyrim,gaming,1455590867,Riitoken,0,0,1,-71,0.0
i ve never tried to minmax a mage like this before  but have you tried using the peryite spellwardshield in your off hand  it would let you handle protection from magic and physical damage in one hand while devoting your other hand to damage i ca nt see a way to not need to switch up spells  i always set up hotkeys but that might not be an option on an xbox 360 controller ,d020sud,skyrim,gaming,1455640357,Kent468,2,0,2,661,0.0

there is a variety of things you can try to improve your magic flailing madman in the fantastic land of skyrim  as you said you have gone through everything there is to be the wonderful wizard of skyrim so let s get a good look at the various schools of magic and see what might fit you  1   alteration   a class for a magician who just wants to feelwell magical  this school as you may know is based around defenses and miscellaneous utilities essentially your  buff  school being a mage is a squishy life unlike the heavy plated beserking monstrosity that are mighty orc  the wall  warrior builds  mages tend to be as well defended as a wet napkin this can be offset later on with enchanting which i will talk about later but that s the bitch way son spells like stoneflesh and dragonskin put some hair on your pale wizard chest and get you ready to rumble in the cold harsh world however alteration shines the greatest when its just doing utility jobs with its tools such as candlelight  transmute  detect life  telekinesis  and paralysis  alteration can work with any school but is more or less a passive school  2   conjuration   imagine this a dragon swoops down and starts causing a ruckus on your hometown of  insert home here  but you just ca nt be bothered to get your soft magic hands dirty well then conjuration is the class for you  this school of magic lets you summon your wageless demonic slaves or undead minions to combat problems for you even awaken your inner goodguymagicman and banish the creatures of oblivion back to the shadow realm from whence they came but if you re the sort of person who s day is nt complete without killing it yourself well then conjuration allows you to summon weapons and bows as well  a pro at this school can have their own undead army or personal daedric escort to help you and your merry magical adventures across the land of skyrim hell you can even steal the souls of the living to use in your horrible  or purely academic  mad experiments by trapping them in soul gems with soul trap as long as you can kill them before the spell ends depending on how you play  this school can be either very hands on or very laid back whether you d decide to get up and personal with hell itself or just let your army of the damn deal with it on your behalf it is a very fun school that can work very well with alteration if you refuse to dawn even the most fragile of armors and restoration if you find yourself getting more than a scratch  3   destruction   now here s a fucking school of magic if you want to be a master of the element  s  that throws balls of explosive fire  bone chilling spikes of ice  or motherfucking sith lightning  then this is the school for you you can either focus into a specific element or branch out and enjoy what destruction has to offer now by endgame  with the proper perks invested such as impact  overpowered  you can essentially have enemies constantly stagger as you launch volley after volley of whatever flamingfrozenshocking projectile you can fling at them until they are nothing but smears on the floor each branch of destruction has their benefits and drawbacks fire works mostly with overtime damage and directly focuses on taking down an enemies health but is somewhat weaker  frost is excellent at slowing an enemy to a crawl and preventing power attacks but can be fairly wonky to work with and does the least damage of the 3 shock does the most damage and is the magician s natural predator as it will beat that magicka bar like it caught it cheating but it takes a ton of magicka to use their spells and cost the most of the 3 each one is a different playstyle and ultimately falls under player preference this school works exceptionally well with restoration as you may be the more offensive kinda guy and it is an offensive kinda school  4   illusion   you ever feel like you want to be a sneaky manipulative piece of shit but ca nt be bothered to do any actual fighting  welcome to the palpatine school of being a manipulative asshole illusion works great if you want to be stealthy and out of the way spells like pacify  fear  frenzy  can make sure you do nt ever have to worry about an enemy again because they either ran away  killed each other  or simply lost the will to be bothered other spells like rally do the opposite and make your allies  better  faster  and stronger which makes this work really well with conjuration if you are simply too shy to deal with people at all then muffle and invisibility are the introverted wizard s best friend  this school is a very supportsecondary school you use on top of your combat or lack thereof as it takes full advantage of a situation given you have the proper training because of this  it can be a school that works well outside of the sphere of the mage that warriors  thiefs  assassins and shifty pedophiles take complete advantage of the possibilities are endless  5   restoration   this is possibly the most essential school that a mage could invest in you can have your fireballs  your invisibility  your bark skin  but nothing really matches being able to heal yourself from damage if you plan on getting hit then restoration is your good friend more or less your  holy builds  have this as a secondary school because of its ability to fuck up zombies spells like turn undead can have the ability to not only make the spirits of the damned run away peeing their pants but also sets them on fire because fuck it that s what good guys do it also has a proper magic defense system as well in the form of wards even a low level steadfast ward spell can have total protection against dragon breath  if you need something to complement your  main  school you can never go wrong with restoration it is a perfectly valid school of magic  6   enchanting  special    probably the most potentially broken  magic school   this basically makes the game easier than your mom on prom night making full suits of daedric armor overflowing with health and magicka and making spells have zero cost speaks for itself you probably wo nt need to bother with builds at this point  now  these can be used in any combination of ways such as destructive conjurer  holy gandalf build batman   alterationrestorationconjuration   manipulative priest  illusionrestoration   pure conjurer  conjuration   pure destruction mage  destruction   sneak archer etc etc  in the end there is nt really any particular way to play a mage if none of the many combinations suit you or you simply are not having fun then magic might not be for you ,d01krkg,skyrim,gaming,1455598735,Loremaster_Wuyo,6,0,3965,20668,0.0

the concept of an illusion mage really speaks to me  however bethesda could ve done so much more with it then what they did  it s basically 4 basic spells that get stronger from novice to master and then master spells that are also the same except they get an area of effect and then you also get muffle and invisibility  so in my opinion you really only get 6 spells which  after a while  is very boring to play with  is there any mod that revamps the illusion spells ,45xzwc,skyrim,gaming,1455562255,Virark,2,0,160,508,0.0

i ve started playing again after some time off  decided to switch from my usual glass hammer approach and play a magic based character  i ve started playing with enchanting and alchemy  are there any pieces of gear that improve enchanting  i ve found alchemy ones and then enchanting potions but not gear  can i also get magika use down to 0   or can i get resists upto 100   or would i have to spread the stats across multi pieces of gear ,45ye9z,skyrim,gaming,1455566612,thebluemonkey,2,0,1556,63055,0.0
  magic resistance   is capped at 85   elemental resistance is also capped at 85   but it is calculated separately from magic resistance  so you can stack  say  fire resistance on top of magic resistance however  in this case  elemental resistance is calculated as percentage of the damage not blocked by the magic resistance for instance  if i have 80  magic resistance and 20  fire resistance  that does nt mean i resist 100  of fire damage it means i resist 80  of fire damage  plus 20  of the remaining 20  that is nt taken care of by my magic resistance so stacking a 20  fire resistance item or potion on top of 80  magic resistance only yields an extra 4  resistance to fire  for 84  total on the other hand  you can stack capped elemental resistance on top of capped magic resistance  so that you resist 9775  of each spell  85  magic resistance  and 85  of the remaining 15      spell cost   can be reduced to zero with sufficiently high enchanting skill but you can only do this for two magic schools  since the most you can get on a single item is a 25  cost reduction  and you can only put two enchantments on each item also note that the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from enchanting is different from the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from potions having  say  an amulet with 20  fortify destruction reduces your spell cost by 20   but a potion that grants 20  fortify destruction increases your spell damage by 20   there are nt gear pieces that improve your enchanting  because there is no fortify enchanting enchantment  only fortify enchanting potions but this can still be used for   maximizing enchantment power    check out  this brief guide   http  wwwuespnetwikiskyrim  enchanting  maximizing_enchantment_power  on the wiki the basic idea is to get a kind of feedback loop going between fortify enchanting potions and fortify alchemy enchantments  brief a fortify enchanting potion  then make a fortify alchemy enchantment while under that potion s effects  which you can use to make an even more powerful fortify enchanting potion  and so on however  the most powerful fortify enchanting potion you re going to be able to make no matter what is somewhere between 40  50   depending on what patches you re using ,d012h14,skyrim,gaming,1455569797,Grundlage,2,0,27,1317,0.0
if you are using vanilla skyrim the most you can change spell cost and resists are 20  per item that being said  if you have ringamulethelmetarmorboots  you get 5 20  enchantments  so you can get one or the other to 100  ,d011ovs,skyrim,gaming,1455568693,Bozzz1,1,0,2893,20443,1.0

all of the vigilants that i ve encountered in skyrim have been limited to the use of a mace and spells from the restoration and alteration schools of magic  it begs the question  could they use  or more importantly why are they prevented from using   swords  bows  shields  sneaking  conjuration magic  bound weaponssummons   destruction magic  i have a reason for asking  role playing and fan fiction creation i m thinking of a former soldier  spellswordscout  recently becoming a devotee of stendarr he s on a pilgrimage to the hall of the vigilant in skyrim which is his first experience as a vigilant since he has knowledge and experience of all the things above  i m wondering if there is some deeply religious reason why he should nt be using them i can see the limitation on the conjuration tree  but i ca nt see the limits imposed on the others ,45x38a,skyrim,gaming,1455551815,p4ck3tl055,16,0,39,436,0.0
conjuration is daedric magic and is therefore banned  think of the to be more like dnd clerics  heavy armor  maces to crush skeleton bones  healing and protection magic ,d00qf0z,skyrim,gaming,1455552182,LosGrak,23,0,546,1609,0.0
generally  they have the standard paladin feel heavy armor  mace  and protective and restorative spells if you run into them  they ll heal you of any diseases also  a few individuals  like the one in markarth  wear higher level robes and use other weaponsspells my guess is the standard macerestoalto set up is learned at vigilant boot camp and as members progress in ranks they ll learn more advanced skills  they re main goal is destroying daedraundead  so they ve got a skill set for that ,d00scks,skyrim,gaming,1455555192,MightyDebo,6,0,426,34436,0.0

for enchanting  get a bunch of soul gems  empty ones   you ll find them constantly just keep saving them  as soon as you find an item with soul trap  disenchant it at an enchanting station  then acquire the best bow  unenchanted  that you can find  and a decentsized soul gem  greater should be fine  though lesser can work too  go to an enchanting station with the bow and a soul gem  select the bow  select  soul trap  from the enchant list and slide the slider all the way to the left  it should say  when the target dies in 1 second  fill a soul gem   name it something original like  soul trap bow  and then craft it  the reason you do the  1 second  thing is because it maximizes the number of charges on it now just roam around and shoot stuff with empty soul gems in your inventory  and you ll fill them up quickly  also  be sure to always check the disenchant menu before selling magic items  you only need to disenchant something once to unlock it  so it s typically better to do that than sell it  there are the  gloves of the pugilist  in the ratways of riften  these are the only source of  fortify unarmed  in the whole game  be sure to disenchant these  if you want to make the game more fun  and are playing on pc  get some mods that make the game mor erealistic i like  traps kill    realistic lightning    improved enemy ai   requires skse    skyui   better menus   a lighting improvement mod that makes everything far darker  you should not be able to see when the moon is not out and it s 12 am  or in the dark parts of a dungeon where there are no torches   even on legendary  though  when you get to be high enoug hlevel with good equipment  the game is still sorta easy  i can 1shot normal dragons with my bow if i crit them   ,d02dym0,skyrim,gaming,1455658172,armahillo,2,0,544,7459,0.0

i think what a lot of people do while playing skyrim is just play the game  that s not a bad thing  but i found something that i did that made the game feel freakin  epic  before you even click  new game  write up a character sheet and make it interesting i ll show you mine  name  kalecoe class  rougemage race  kajit kalecoe has no desire to be liked  he is not a good person  he was brought to skyrim in chains and he intends to leave it with all of its gold  kalecoe s weakness is his love for gold  if a decision is made where someone tries to bribe kalecoe  he takes the bribe  kalecoe is an illusion mage who hides in the shadows and fucks with peoples minds  he uses his powers for gold  kalecoe is not evil  just very very selfish  name  frummond class  scout race  wood elf frummond used to be in the army  he was one of the best scouts in his division  using all kinds of weapons  he is exceptional with a sword and also a bow  frummond is a simple man who will help anybody in need  frummonds main weakness is that he s too naive  he ll stop at nothing to help others and he has no need for special weapons and armor  frummond wears weak armor and uses awful weapons  well that s how i play the game now i do nt make the decisions for the characters  they do  for example  kalecoe actually kills off the dark brotherhood  because he was offered money to do so  kalecoe helped the assasins in whiterun find the redguard woman even though he swore to help her they offered him money  kalecoe became a vampire because he saw how much wealth harkon had and wanted it for himself  frummond joined the imperials because that s what he knows best  he wears terrible armour and uses a steel sword because he hates change  frummond brews his own potions and looks after the average joe he helped prevent the thieves guild from getting bigger  stuff like that ,d01tnbv,skyrim,gaming,1455626738,Bowmance,2,0,959,3014,0.0

so  i ve been researching how to fix this problem for a few hours now but nobody seems to have it the way i do basically  i killed the cultists way back when i finished the windcaller quest i got their note i read it then continued to finish the rest of the game so  i completed the main quest  the dawn guard dlc  and a bunch of side quests  trying to do it lorewise   finally i get to windhelm to take the boat to solsthiem  and the captain talks normally with me i do nt have to bargain with him or anything  just 250 gold and off we go so once i m in solstheim i do a bunch of side quests there  and now i own property in raven rock trouble is  i ca nt seem to get anyone to talk to me about the earth stone neloth  the mushroom wizard  is nt in raven rock  but back at tel mythrin talking to him does nt initiate anything to do with the stones or miraak  so  basically i ve tried almost everything i ve tried to set my quest progress to different points to try and start the temple of miraak  but it just breaks it going back and refinding the cultists is not possible at this point because that was around save 13 and i m at like save 130 what should i do  is there any other way to force the quest  s  to start  thanks for any help ,4603z5,skyrim,gaming,1455587279,oue_k,1,0,43,270,0.0

the elder scrolls  dominion  takes place in the entire aldmeri dominion main plots would involve the build up for the next great war and the imperial attempts to sabotage the military build up may take place concurrently or shortly after skyrim  with only vague references to the  troubles in skyrim  importantly the goals and ideologies of the members of the dominion would be presented in a positive light  with emphasis on how everybody is actually pretty happy  and the economy seems to be booming of course there will be drawbacks  like some racism and maybe the occasional secret police raids  but most common citizens will feel that it s worth it of course the imperial agents  maybe some of them blades or penitus oculatus  will be shown as cutthroat  paranoid agents who will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals  there would be a quest line to combat the imperials or to help sabotage the dominion  though you may be able to do both  the thieves guild may be based in elsweyr  the fighters guild could be a mercenary group that is taking care of policing while the army prepares for war  the mages guild could be a research lab for the war effort  or just a regular college  the assassins guild could be made up of some surviving dark brotherhood members  maybe even some that were presumed dead by cicero  important mechanics would be in game consequences for your actions oh  you helped imperial agents destroy the mill  now the khajit that ran the place is in the street begging for money because he ca nt afford the repairs oh  killed the spy that was bothering that shopkeeper  now she ll happily sell you better goods at lower prices  or maybe offer an alternative solution to a tricky quest oh  you did nt kill the thief that you caught while on patrol with the mercenaries  every bandit hideout now has an extra enemy for a few days oh  you  did  kill that thief  now the thieves guild thinks they ve been crossed and wants you to find out who s betraying them  in this game you have to think about who your actions will affect in the whole world and question whether this is really what you want ,d01h753,skyrim,gaming,1455592656,RedDemocracy,10,0,1,1986,0.0
i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,d01bg2z,skyrim,gaming,1455583606,sloogz,10,0,337,4059,0.0

the elder scrolls vi  alinor takes place on the summerset isle a few years after skyrim the main city of focus would be alinor under the third aldmeri dominion s control  there would be a few factions to join  the aldmeri dominion s army the altmer pantheon s religious body the psijic order the aldmeri dominion s version of the mage s guild the aldmeri dominion s version of the fighter s guild an aldmeri dominion spy and assassin guild  reminiscent of the blades or the morag tong  the game would start you off on a boat reaching the summerset isle  perhaps you were a dissenter of the thalmor or a talos worshiper the ship would crash off the northwestern coast of the isle near lillandril or alinor  the altmer s version of the mage s guild would be orderly and extremely wellkept  considering their veneration of the magical arts the questline would be similar to that of the mage s guild in morrowindoblivion  the altmer s version of the fighter s guild  on the other hand  is decrepit and the questline would be about raising it from the ground and helping it become stronger than the other magical related guilds  the aldmeri dominion s army would be joinable  and would be all about rooting out talos worhsip and aldmeri dissenters within the isle racism would be highly present in the army  only the altmer themselves spared from the scorn of their superiors and of their colleagues an example quest would be this  a man was reported for having an undesirable opinion about the third aldmeri dominion  and it would be your job to carry out his arrest and interrogation  the aldmeri dominion s version of the blades or the morag tong would be all about assassinating talos worshipers and dissenters and quieting public knowledge of the outside world s view on the altmer and their government  the psijic order would play a part as a joinable faction and a part of the main quest they are steeped in mystery and are the next step for a mage beyond the dominion s sanctioned guild  the altmer s pantheon would be joinable  helping to convert outsiders to the altmer pantheon  etc  the main quest would be about the eye of magnus and the untapped power that was discussed lightly in skyrim the main quest begins with rumors of the psijic s return  and you have to seek them out based on clues you get on the boat you originally crashed on the isle on  plus the local rumors upon finding the psijic order  you ll do some grunt work and work your way up the ranks  eventually you ll get attacked by the aldmeri dominion and you ll hear about how the eye of magnus was stolen  and how the dominion recently acquired a powerful artifact from across the sea  that artifact being the staff of magnus  whoever would be leading the aldmeri dominion at that point in time would utilize the staff and eye to become a demigod  much like how the almsivi became gods  but through the eye of magnus instead the rest of the main quest would focus around the psijic s pursuit of recapturing the eye and putting and end to unrightful godhood ,d01gtdd,skyrim,gaming,1455592052,ElvishisnotTengwar,3,0,3688,2776,0.0

i would set it in either black marsh or hammerfell and go back to the morrowind formula of making a strange and wondrous world  as well as making the player largely feel at a disadvantage for a lot of it the player wo nt be some god in human flesh  at least not from the start they will have to build and work to it  i think i d also probably lean more toward static leveling  since i felt that it was rather rewarding when you managed to get to higher level dungeons and collect higher level loot  and tbh  i d prolly add in a lot of spell effects that were missing in skyrim  and mysticism would definitely get back in  i d try my best to get more weapon types like spears and halberds  furthermore  i d love to build on fallout 4 s crafting system  although less tiered and more varied i would love to add much more aesthetic influence  with different racial styles and being able to have  say  a khajiitistyle pommel on a nordic hilt with an argonianstyle blade  i d try and make the components all as viable as one another  too  as for plot and questlines  i think it s a given the games are leading up to a clash with the thalmor  so we re going to see a followup on that a reveal of their intentions  their desire to unravel the world by waking the godhead  so on and so forth i wan na get into much more esoteric stuff with the main quest and utilize a lot of lore that s not been used before  i d also love to have questlines be a bit more layered and have multiple ways of resolving them more in the morrowindstyle  where things can and probably will go wrong  and the journals account for things like npc death  faction questlines will prolly end up a bit more mundane  but have more content packed into them skyrim i always felt rewarded you too easily and you just ascended the ranks extremely fast so this time  you re going to have a bit more mundane experience at the beginning  but you re going to be interacting with guildmates more as a result radiant quests will probably still be around but a bit less  since i find a merit in handcrafted stuff handcrafted quests probably have less edging toward fetch quests  which were pretty damn rampant in skyrim  so i think overall  probably largely go back to an older way of doing things but revitalize the older concepts with a bit of the new  edit  oh and there s discussion earlier on voice actors i think i d definitely invest more in simply hiring way more voice actors or having the voice actors we already have doing more kinds of voices for different characters  rather than trying to get people like liam neeson or max von sydow to voice characters quality is important  but a diversity in voice is equally important when you have tons of npcs  hence  i would want to make as many npcs as i can feel unique  furthermore  i ve noticed a lot of npcs tend to have unique greetings  and what it results in is people blurting out their life story   i work for belethor at the general goods store  or the riverwood vendor thanking you for getting the golden claw every time you pass even after it s been months  when i actually feel simply recording a bunch of simple greetings would be better  though unique greetings would have a merit of their own and if i could  i d put them in as well  although a bit diminished  giving disposition a greater presence would also be a good idea and would factor into the greetings better  npcs would greet you less favorably if they do nt like youmore favorably if they do like you   i do nt think anyone wants a dialogue wheel again  but maybe putting in more unseen factors to increase or decrease disposition would be better even adding a ui indication in the spirit skyrim wanted to is possible  perhaps by having the dialogue menu or some element of it brighter with higher disposition and darker with lower disposition ,d02bii4,skyrim,gaming,1455654918,NeuroticNyx,1,0,513,20901,0.0
