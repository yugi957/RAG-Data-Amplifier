if you open the server browser  you can type  pd_watergate  into the map box and it ll bring you all the servers currently running watergate  unfortunatly not many servers are running it  which is a crying shame  because it s a really fun map ,d025ulw,tf2,gaming,1455647350.0,thesteam,6.0,0.0,2079.0,5677.0,1.0

heavy is pretty balanced  and heavy is pretty powerful at last in 6s even in pubs  a heavymedic combination can dominate the playing field perhaps more weapon choices for the heavy would be nice  but i think buffing him would be too much ,d02nr59,tf2,gaming,1455672717.0,AgentMafia,2.0,0.0,764.0,3007.0,1.0
i think the passive 20  damage resistance would nt be broken it s only active while he s spun down completely  not when he s spinning up or down it would help him with his survivability  since he s pretty much everyone s bullet whore i wish there was a way to test this  like a mod of some sorts heavy s health regen would be slow  but could definately help in situations where he does nt have a sandvich  although a heavy without a sandvich is stupid his real problem is his survivability is overestimated by valve heavy can take hits  but not as well as he should ,d02o8vh,tf2,gaming,1455673462.0,CaptainKappa14,1.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0

besides pyro  the only class i consider to be lacking in performance is heavy  who has a number of problems without a medic or a sandwich  heavy has problems performing his job as an offensivedefensive tank the whole point of heavy is to be the center of attention and absorb lots of damage while your team attacksdoes their jobs if your team does nt have a medic  you re screwed 300 is still a lot of hp  but it does nt go very far if you do nt have a medic healing you i think it would be a good idea to give heavy a  20  damage resistance while spun up  on all of his miniguns  or at least everyone of them except the tomislav  which could have a new stat  like extra movement speed or something the natascha and brass beast already have those  but stock is usually superior to both it would give heavy a better edge in fights  and i think it would be very good for him to have some sort of natural damage resistance i also think he could have a small hp regen while spun up and crouching  since he s basically a sitting duck while spun up and crouching  literally  and it could give him some more survivability spies and snipers would still screw you over  but i think it would be fair i would also like it if they brought his minigun back to it s old state  without the weird drop in accuracydamage for the 1st second of revup  and restore it s accuracy however  to balance it out  his minigun takes slightly longer to rev  about one second   it might need another change to keep it balanced  but i ll leave that up to your discussion ,465nmf,tf2,gaming,1455670915.0,CaptainKappa14,5.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0
maybe because there would be issues with activating it if the wrong weapon was out like if your frontier justice was out of ammo  you ca nt use the killtaunt but with the taunt menu you could if you had your primary out and you wanted to do your melee taunt  how would that work  quickly switch to melee and back ,d02msu9,tf2,gaming,1455671279.0,Meester_Tweester,6.0,0.0,2652.0,11692.0,0.0

might as well toss my two cents in  although it s a little late to the thread  for me  the best thing with the contractoriented updates is the contracts themselves it s almost undeniably fun to get a new contract and then complete that sucker gives you a good reason to play  as if you needed one anyhow   where valve got it wrong  1 too many freakin  crates at first  you could immediately sell the crates for pretty good amounts on the market and they were one of the more desireable drops later in the process  they become irritating to get when you want a weapon and the crates are only selling for maybe a scrap or two at first  it s  oh boy  crate  awesome   sell  kaching   about halfway through  it seems you re getting about 50  crates and it becomes  crap  another one of these   and the question becomes whether to unbox and find crap  selling the crate for squat on the market  or just deleting it  2 crates should never  ever  ever have crappy condition skins ever there is an undeniable sense of feeling screwed when you complete a contract  drop a crate  open it  because you re stupid  like me   and end up with a shitty skin worth  05 that just bites and makes you not want to open crates when a contract completion weapon can be more valuable than an unboxed weapon  the system is not working right if you open a crate  the skin you get should be top quality with maybe a 30  or so chance of strange  not potentially shit quality with what seems like about as much chance of a strange as there is of unboxing an unusual i ve unboxed way too many contract crates and ended up with a grand total of one strange which leads me to  3 the incidence of strange weapons in the crates is ridiculously low i think there s a damn good argument for a return to  weapon from a crate is gon na be strange  again  you spend  250 plus tax to open the digital box  you want something of value it does nt have to be a wash or more than you put in  but it should have some value to it especially since you already paid  6 just to be eligible to get it again  it sucks so bad to effectively spend  850 plus tax for a chance to get and open a crate  and then find a nonstrange piece of shit well worn skin it s like gaben just takes your money then slaps you in the face and laughs  4 duplicate skins  especially from crates duplicate skins from a contract once in a while is maybe okay  but overall multiple copies of the same piece of shit just sucks this gets even worse if you get duplicates from crates this badly needs a fix  i ca nt help but think you can still have rare  seldom unboxed items while also largely avoiding duplicates being unboxed  number 4 here was edited for coherency  so in conclusion  i really like the contract concept and find it definitely keeps me coming back to the game i really just about hate the frequency of crate  rewards  especially when the chance of unboxing a strange is very low and the chance of getting a shit to middling quality skin is very high it gives me the distinct sense of being basically ripped off while valve just kinda shrugs i expect that kind of bullshit from a company like ea i do nt expect or appreciate it from a perceived  good  company like valve ,d02k3vl,tf2,gaming,1455667132.0,letdogsvote,2.0,0.0,8979.0,410807.0,1.0

i m late to this thread but  here s the opinion of someone who has been with the game for a while  when gun mettle came out  it was something new for tf2 contracts were a novel idea  but it wore off quick players had been starved for anything new for the game for a while i d look back at the medic update  love amp  war  sniper vs spy  pyromania you know  those updates that had a 3 day count down day 1  the maps day 2  the new weapons  day 3  the new game modes  updates that added a ton of stuff to the game new weapons  strategies etc now it s just  give us  6 for the chance to give us more money to open a crate for a weapon reskin  the first campaign was new and novel  but now it seems like this is the direction valve will go in and the quality updates of the past are long gone it s why i will never buy another campaign pass and i m sure i m not the only one ,d02nuni,tf2,gaming,1455672866.0,shenrougu,2.0,0.0,3634.0,3647.0,0.0

that guy honestly sounds like a bit of a douche  in hl  of course good engineers matter  even if not as much as some other classes  because both teams are made to run one any increase in skill your engineer has that the enemy does nt is a bonus to your team  in 6s  engineers do matter a lot less though because explosive classes are always run 99  of the time  medics do their best to utilise ubercharge to the full  and generally you will have less time to set up a sentry as well engineers do still shine at lasts  where their defensive power makes them useful for wasting an enemy uber and shutting down scouts  but if you want to play 6v6 as an engineer main you re going to need to be able to play other classes for the 80  of the time where an engineer is nt that great  in matchmaking  nobody knows what will be good yet maybe engineers will be the most important class probably not ,d028gox,tf2,gaming,1455650874.0,remember_morick_yori,29.0,0.0,234.0,13881.0,0.0
gt  one of the coordinators of the hl team i m in is a 6s player  and downright dismisses engineers i ve gotten a littletono feedback on my playing because simply   i do nt care  and while i ve tried to make engineer have a good name in the past  on rtf2   i m questioning my main is it time to just give up my favorite class  and become a boring soldier main  i have no clue    protip    bad leaders are a dime a dozen  i m sitting out this season  so forgive me if i m mistaken  but did nt ugc just get done playing steel or steel is the upcoming map being played  that map  of all maps  is the one where i say engie is absolutely pivotal you have your team escort engie with a level 3 sentry into the e cap room  suddenly the defending team has a huge problem on their hands and tons of pressure to deal with only took a couple steel games for me to notice a pattern of this  and soon after i was taking special care to watch my engie and offering to go with him to guard him and buy him some room to get his sentry up  obviously when the combo itself was headed that direction anyways of course   get a sentry in e  suddenly most of their classes can not actively pressure e to stop your cap  and only a couple sightlines or classes can continue harrassing the point even if a spy is fully confident he can get the sap  the respawn time for anyone that s died fucking hurts even the best spy can fail a sap attempt  and a failure there is 20 more seconds of cap time even if they successfully deny e  the effort that s been demanded of them to do so means they ve had to surrender the other active point  largely thanks to the sentry  do nt let this kind of shit get you down  there s all kinds of bias from players against everything possible  and constant claims that this or that class is worthless or easy tons of 6s players hate hl classes  tons of hl players have a grudge against 6s classes  etc etc etc for engie  i find it s common for a lot of 6s players to dislike the class because a sentry can deny a scout and a jumper completely  which is obviously quite dull for them the result is plenty of claims the class is easy since you have an aimbot in my opinion  most of those people are simply trying to validate how pro they are by claiming their class and their work is leagues above that of their comrades the reality is that each class provides it s own challenges and strengths it s all just fragile egos needing reassurance and validation  and honestly  not hating on your friend as a person  but realize many people want to be a leader for the  prestige  of being a leader the people that actually have what it takes to lead are a small fraction of the players that want to lead so they can gloat and talk about what a tactical genius they think they are i would expect a leader to have at least some sense for each class and how to best utilize them  and if i m correct that currently ugc is playing steel and this guy s response to how to best utilize engie is  i do nt care   then i seriously question his leadership engie would be a fucking cornerstone of any steel strats i d use  personally ,d02dg6c,tf2,gaming,1455657493.0,AFlyingNun,5.0,0.0,3181.0,37590.0,1.0

after reading the cactus canyon thread  where it s in beta since forever   i have a few ideas for our beloved tf2 team to repurpose more of the beta and empty servers  1  one is as i had mentioned in other threads  an other mode  server which would host tc  arena  pd maps  and take out doomsday and put into these ones that itself would be enough of a map cycle to constitute a large enough server for people to play on these do nt need much since not a lot of people would play it  but maybe at most 15  of the valve servers would be enough for this  2  another idea is to make beta servers  currently only for 247 asteroid and cc  for workshop maps that are in beta status unfortunately  custom maps do nt get much shine  as most people would just play whatever map that s in valve servers currently only nonvalve servers  ie community or custom servers  have custom maps  and a good percentage of them are established custom maps that had been played for a long time or tf2mapsnet s gamedays or people would just download the map and check themselves  at this point  after 3  or 4 if you count halloween 2015  contracts you start to see some of the issues pop up unfinished andor not wellbalancedwip maps are becoming official and while new maps being added officially is always nice  the tough break ones have exploits  readjustments  missing things happen in the maps  personally i feel that it s because these maps do not get played much by a larger pool of players  or at all by the general public that any feedback to the map makers are slow or very few that the mapmaker could nt get enough feedback to improve on hisher map note that at this point i am not saying the tf2 mapping community by itself is bad  they are an excellent bunch that makes maps for a game that s been almost out for 10 years there s also map critique people who goes thru the maps thoroughly  i did some before when i was active in tf2maps   but sometimes  perhaps more voices being heard is a good thing  which is why i want to suggest that valve make beta workshop map rotations  say 23 maps a quarteryear or every 2 months put into beta servers along with asteroid and cc  sorry 247ers   this also utilizes the workshop feature of steam where you would subscribe to these maps as well  and then you can go to the workshop page for feedback after playing them on the valve beta servers so far most workshop comments are  this looks cool  and some occasional feedback about the map itself  or a spooky skeleton so adding them to valve servers would add a lot more exposure to the mapmaker on getting more feedback  of any type  mind you   which allows himher to use the feedback to fix or improve the map  however this involves a bit more work from the tf2 team to go thru the workshop maps and decide which maps to put in the servers and the quality varies by a lot  so i think the map should at least be in beta status  and it s recommended that it also has a tf2mapsnet map thread opened as well    tl  dr    1 add other modes  servers 2 add workshop maps into beta servers on a bimonthlyquarterly rotation for better custom map quality what do you guys think  edit  some wordings added,4623uh,tf2,gaming,1455623204.0,penpen35,23.0,0.0,2862.0,4581.0,0.0

great gameplay  the spire and mid point are a great example of how to balance around scout  demo  and soldier s mobility by giving them ways to use it to the full  while also giving plenty of cover to medic however the sniper sightline game can be a little strong at times easily one of the best 6s maps in terms of gameplay  visually  i do nt feel like it hits the overall tf2 theme very well  though rather than the industrial blu v agricultural red stylings of many other tf2 maps  which feature wood and sheet metal to spice up the show  it s just clean concrete interspersed with grassy dirt all the way through  sort of like gorge   a disclaimer  though variation between maps is a good idea  and if all maps stuck to the same formula the game would be a lot more boring however  if you re playing process a lot  it can still start to feel a bit washedout after a while  this map is sort of like the polar opposite of 2fort  and of course  like many things  that comes down to personal preference more than objective fact but one thing that can be said for certain is it can lead to balanced 6s combat ,czym93q,tf2,gaming,1455384703.0,remember_morick_yori,5.0,0.0,234.0,13881.0,0.0

yeah wellthey probably have other priorities now and both beta maps are nt in great needs to be released sadly  however i want to suggest that since they have beta servers  they can put some community workshop beta maps on rotation  eg two maps per month  so map makers can get more feedback and coverage  and players can try something new obviously the tf team would choose the maps to put on  so that s a bit of extra work there ,d01euyx,tf2,gaming,1455588972.0,penpen35,3.0,0.0,2862.0,4581.0,0.0

i agree with your message in general and as a sniper main i have to appreciate that really nice run of kills and if i were on the opposing team would probably end up really hating you because you would be killing me so many times  one caveat though  playing games like you want is great  and i do nt mind the guy who spends half the round taunting or the spycrab or the competitive scout or the new sniper who is trying to shoot through the glass  or the spy that is always killing me  ok i hate that spy a little bit   but the chat in your video brought something up that should be mentioned  i draw the line when people are hacking  i do nt think you are  it s pretty obvious when players are and i am also accused of hacking when i m doing really well   play however you want  enjoy the game and all  but when you play against others please do nt use hacks  do whatever you want in single player  but there s no quicker way to end the fun for everyone else than using hacks maybe that s how some people have fun  but i ve been in countless servers that were really even and both teams were really into it and then the server was cleared when a hacker showed up and just started dominating everyone ,d01e36x,tf2,gaming,1455587775.0,abrahamdrinkin,17.0,0.0,568.0,5756.0,0.0

well  honestly this is a subjective question i suppose to me  i think they are but let me explain why i think this  one of the coordinators of the hl team i m in is a 6s player  and downright dismisses engineers i ve gotten a littletono feedback on my playing because simply   i do nt care  and while i ve tried to make engineer have a good name in the past  on rtf2   i m questioning my main is it time to just give up my favorite class  and become a boring soldier main  i have no clue  i play hl steel  and i play engineer am i really worth it to my team  especially in the maps this season  this is really being done for reflection  i ve learned a lot this season  it being my first   and i want to see on how i really want this next season to go am i sticking with the texan  or am i just becoming a lime green scout  edit  my leader is generally still a fun guy  but he just gets me down a bit i understand where he s coming from  and maybe i take it too harshly ,464240,tf2,gaming,1455650234.0,ThisIsTotallyChris,15.0,0.0,7.0,544.0,0.0
that guy honestly sounds like a bit of a douche  in hl  of course good engineers matter  even if not as much as some other classes  because both teams are made to run one any increase in skill your engineer has that the enemy does nt is a bonus to your team  in 6s  engineers do matter a lot less though because explosive classes are always run 99  of the time  medics do their best to utilise ubercharge to the full  and generally you will have less time to set up a sentry as well engineers do still shine at lasts  where their defensive power makes them useful for wasting an enemy uber and shutting down scouts  but if you want to play 6v6 as an engineer main you re going to need to be able to play other classes for the 80  of the time where an engineer is nt that great  in matchmaking  nobody knows what will be good yet maybe engineers will be the most important class probably not ,d028gox,tf2,gaming,1455650874.0,remember_morick_yori,29.0,0.0,234.0,13881.0,0.0
even in 6s engineers are worth something  last holds  i do nt know much about hl  but i do know that engineers are definitely more important there than in 6s if you enjoy engineer  then play it if your team is nt supporting you and helping you improve then you should find a new one  as umiauw62 says  ,d028gk0,tf2,gaming,1455650870.0,Ymir_from_Saturn,17.0,0.0,290.0,42580.0,0.0
find another team if your leader is an asshole engineer is nt a very powerful class in hl  and he gets worse as teams get better he s probably still better than pyro and spy though i d recommend gitting gud at some other class also but mainly because always playing one class is boring  also  shotgun dm,d028b26,tf2,gaming,1455650665.0,miauw62,16.0,0.0,320.0,9265.0,0.0
gt  one of the coordinators of the hl team i m in is a 6s player  and downright dismisses engineers i ve gotten a littletono feedback on my playing because simply   i do nt care  and while i ve tried to make engineer have a good name in the past  on rtf2   i m questioning my main is it time to just give up my favorite class  and become a boring soldier main  i have no clue    protip    bad leaders are a dime a dozen  i m sitting out this season  so forgive me if i m mistaken  but did nt ugc just get done playing steel or steel is the upcoming map being played  that map  of all maps  is the one where i say engie is absolutely pivotal you have your team escort engie with a level 3 sentry into the e cap room  suddenly the defending team has a huge problem on their hands and tons of pressure to deal with only took a couple steel games for me to notice a pattern of this  and soon after i was taking special care to watch my engie and offering to go with him to guard him and buy him some room to get his sentry up  obviously when the combo itself was headed that direction anyways of course   get a sentry in e  suddenly most of their classes can not actively pressure e to stop your cap  and only a couple sightlines or classes can continue harrassing the point even if a spy is fully confident he can get the sap  the respawn time for anyone that s died fucking hurts even the best spy can fail a sap attempt  and a failure there is 20 more seconds of cap time even if they successfully deny e  the effort that s been demanded of them to do so means they ve had to surrender the other active point  largely thanks to the sentry  do nt let this kind of shit get you down  there s all kinds of bias from players against everything possible  and constant claims that this or that class is worthless or easy tons of 6s players hate hl classes  tons of hl players have a grudge against 6s classes  etc etc etc for engie  i find it s common for a lot of 6s players to dislike the class because a sentry can deny a scout and a jumper completely  which is obviously quite dull for them the result is plenty of claims the class is easy since you have an aimbot in my opinion  most of those people are simply trying to validate how pro they are by claiming their class and their work is leagues above that of their comrades the reality is that each class provides it s own challenges and strengths it s all just fragile egos needing reassurance and validation  and honestly  not hating on your friend as a person  but realize many people want to be a leader for the  prestige  of being a leader the people that actually have what it takes to lead are a small fraction of the players that want to lead so they can gloat and talk about what a tactical genius they think they are i would expect a leader to have at least some sense for each class and how to best utilize them  and if i m correct that currently ugc is playing steel and this guy s response to how to best utilize engie is  i do nt care   then i seriously question his leadership engie would be a fucking cornerstone of any steel strats i d use  personally ,d02dg6c,tf2,gaming,1455657493.0,AFlyingNun,5.0,0.0,3181.0,37590.0,1.0

holding territory is nt as sexy as taking it  but your team will find it difficult to win koth or ad without a competent engineer reinforcing turf with a dispenser  teleporter  and sentry  adds minutes to your clock   as i like to point out    most classes trade on health    they trade their health to take ground and deal damage to the other team   engineers  however  trade on time    they spend their time shoring up their teams  holds  saving their team time spawning and resupplying they also force the the other team to spend their time  health  and ammo to destroy their contraptions a good engy will multiply the value of their team by saving them time  a bad engineer plays for themself and is nt flexible enough to support their team in the way the team needs ,d02k55a,tf2,gaming,1455667185.0,ScootPilgrim,1.0,0.0,91.0,3898.0,0.0

i do nt have much to talk about for cp_process process obviously plays well  otherwise it would nt be a comp staple   but the map gives me a veryquakeish vibe on its design that i do nt feel like it s a tf2 map it s obviously different  you can say so for me  the style deducts points for the map  on another note i would like to start discussing about more custom maps in the near future  maybe in march   if you have one that s not in this list  do let me know  https  docsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1aqrgoss5ol21fieobxgig8w8elygqmc4ibdjptncliedit  usp  sharing  do not mind the versions issue ,czyhu3g,tf2,gaming,1455376500.0,penpen35,20.0,0.0,2862.0,4581.0,0.0

cp process is hands down my favourite map for rocket jumping  aside from actual jump maps obviously   mid is litetally a playground  one of my favourite sixes maps and also a decent pub map  better for pubs than most sixes maps imo ,czyjdvy,tf2,gaming,1455379637.0,relaxedgamer,17.0,0.0,312.0,401.0,0.0
arguably the blandest map in tf2  both in aesthetic and map design that s not an inherently bad thing  and it s certainly an excellent map for 6s  but if you re in the mood for some classic tf2 craziness  you re probably least likely to find it on process ,czyhyyv,tf2,gaming,1455376793.0,MastaAwesome,23.0,0.0,2781.0,11497.0,0.0
for a comp staple  this map is still pretty fun to play on pubs definitely a top5 map ,czyqj4w,tf2,gaming,1455392133.0,pwc-,4.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,0.0
i fucking love this map it was one of the first maps i played  i think the 3rd  not sure   and has been one of my fav maps ever since the ramps and shit makes it a extremely good map for rocketjumping around  this means mging noobs is even easier on process than on hightower same for stickyjumping and cabering a sniper  the best part with this map is that engi does nt ruin the map  unlike most 5cps last is very open so this means flanking the sentry or sniping the engi is very easy,czyzow8,tf2,gaming,1455408512.0,6root,8.0,0.0,472.0,4901.0,0.0
i like this map overall it s terrible for pubs  and rather frustrating for highlander play  but it is amazing for 6s  the map design is really good  but the style is rather austere it does nt really look like a tf2 map it s similar to gorge  but at least gorge had more props this is just plain  but that negative is mitigated in full due to how excellent 6s play is on it ,czz8uxb,tf2,gaming,1455424980.0,LittleDinghy,4.0,0.0,1303.0,34127.0,0.0
i actually like this map on pubs but i have a hard time playing spy on this map too many choke areas  yet alot of open areas that make it hard to safely uncloak then there s the garage doors that give away my presence even when invisible i can see how it d be fun for other classes though  like sniper or solly ,czyxox2,tf2,gaming,1455404948.0,MDKLXCS,3.0,0.0,2019.0,7749.0,0.0
my absolute favorite map  i like to rocket jump and this map is awesome  the rollout was nt even intended to be this epic but the ramps on choke are really nice to surf and boost jump on them there are a lot more jumps like from mid to rollout from lower spire to pc i did a video with terrible quality once good times  in lobbies i only played eu 6s process pls a few days ago i was on a jump map which had parts of other maps in it  also process and i had a lot of fun  i never did any epic market gardening yet  but i own everyone with my bhops and then crit   good times screw valve for putting the shit map after it in map rotation ,czzhp52,tf2,gaming,1455453729.0,Vipitis,3.0,0.0,180.0,1533.0,0.0

great gameplay  the spire and mid point are a great example of how to balance around scout  demo  and soldier s mobility by giving them ways to use it to the full  while also giving plenty of cover to medic however the sniper sightline game can be a little strong at times easily one of the best 6s maps in terms of gameplay  visually  i do nt feel like it hits the overall tf2 theme very well  though rather than the industrial blu v agricultural red stylings of many other tf2 maps  which feature wood and sheet metal to spice up the show  it s just clean concrete interspersed with grassy dirt all the way through  sort of like gorge   a disclaimer  though variation between maps is a good idea  and if all maps stuck to the same formula the game would be a lot more boring however  if you re playing process a lot  it can still start to feel a bit washedout after a while  this map is sort of like the polar opposite of 2fort  and of course  like many things  that comes down to personal preference more than objective fact but one thing that can be said for certain is it can lead to balanced 6s combat ,czym93q,tf2,gaming,1455384703.0,remember_morick_yori,5.0,0.0,234.0,13881.0,0.0

this issue has been around for several months at least and despite several complaints on reddit and presumably hundreds of bug reports  valve continues to ignore people who spent their keys  metal  cash on these hats and they only work 50  of the time is there anything we can do to get valve to fix this  to do anything   for anyone who does nt know what i m talking about  circling effects occasionally disappear and reappear several meters away  then begin slowly moving towards the wearer  making it look like their hat is nt unusual at all ,464tog,tf2,gaming,1455659665.0,TheFinalPancake,31.0,0.0,2576.0,5090.0,1.0

well  you re more important than pyro and spy  because you can make dispensers for your power classes to resupply from   full disclosure  i play hl pyro   but on a serious note  engie  along with spy and pyro  is probably one of the least important classes  and the higher up you go the more this is true   that being said  there are still things you can do  and do them well and if you really enjoy engie then you should just stick with it  and get a mentor  a gold engie  to look over demos with you to actually give you more feedback  rather than some steel peer who prolly does nt really have experience to give you suggestions anyways though it would nt hurt to learn how to play scout and soldier because they ll help you with your shotgun dm and wrangled rocket damage  also i used to have a dude on my team who would be all lolhl and i eventually had to cut him because his lolhl attitude made him a terrible teammate who could nt take a loss in the  inferior  game mode even though his complete and utter lack of game sense was partially responsible for us losing in the first place there are plenty of 6s players who play hl and are nt fucking shitlords acting like they re being martyred into some game mode they do nt even want to play  so my advice is give him a big ol  fat one and start looking for a team with more mature people on it ,d02fqah,tf2,gaming,1455660541.0,Piperita,0.0,0.0,137.0,1663.0,0.0

i agree with your message in general and as a sniper main i have to appreciate that really nice run of kills and if i were on the opposing team would probably end up really hating you because you would be killing me so many times  one caveat though  playing games like you want is great  and i do nt mind the guy who spends half the round taunting or the spycrab or the competitive scout or the new sniper who is trying to shoot through the glass  or the spy that is always killing me  ok i hate that spy a little bit   but the chat in your video brought something up that should be mentioned  i draw the line when people are hacking  i do nt think you are  it s pretty obvious when players are and i am also accused of hacking when i m doing really well   play however you want  enjoy the game and all  but when you play against others please do nt use hacks  do whatever you want in single player  but there s no quicker way to end the fun for everyone else than using hacks maybe that s how some people have fun  but i ve been in countless servers that were really even and both teams were really into it and then the server was cleared when a hacker showed up and just started dominating everyone ,d01e36x,tf2,gaming,1455587775.0,abrahamdrinkin,17.0,0.0,568.0,5756.0,0.0

heya chris  i d like to point out  yes  engineers are very good in highlander however  this is mainly due to the class restrictions that highlander puts in place  giving each class equal roles  this  of course  tweaks game balance to make some classes more significant than in normal gameplay circumstances so i would argue that yes  engineer has worth  in highlander since you re forced to have an engineer on both teams  you ca nt really deny that a good engineer will help the team more than a bad one  him dismissing engineer in   highlander   is stupid however  him dismissing engineer in practically any other gamemode is somewhat acceptable  be it pubs  6v6  4v4  or anything that does nt force you to play offensive engi at all times   this is mainly due to most classes being better than engineer on offense  but engineer is still better than the others for defense the only way that offensive engineer is viable is when you literally ban the ability to switch to the other 8 classes    conclusion    he can bitch about engineer being a useless turd to the team anywhere except highlander however  since he s bitching about hl engineers  he s in the wrong because engineers are nt being a burden to the team on offense  and are contributing members due to there literally being no other option  engineer  as a class  is nt worth  it 247 in  unrestricted gameplay   however  highlander pretty much makes everything used 247  so that everything is viable 247 regardless of how the original balance is ,d02hc2f,tf2,gaming,1455662813.0,TF2SolarLight,3.0,0.0,780.0,4876.0,0.0

besides pyro  the only class i consider to be lacking in performance is heavy  who has a number of problems without a medic or a sandwich  heavy has problems performing his job as an offensivedefensive tank the whole point of heavy is to be the center of attention and absorb lots of damage while your team attacksdoes their jobs if your team does nt have a medic  you re screwed 300 is still a lot of hp  but it does nt go very far if you do nt have a medic healing you i think it would be a good idea to give heavy a  20  damage resistance while spun up  on all of his miniguns  or at least everyone of them except the tomislav  which could have a new stat  like extra movement speed or something the natascha and brass beast already have those  but stock is usually superior to both it would give heavy a better edge in fights  and i think it would be very good for him to have some sort of natural damage resistance i also think he could have a small hp regen while spun up and crouching  since he s basically a sitting duck while spun up and crouching  literally  and it could give him some more survivability spies and snipers would still screw you over  but i think it would be fair i would also like it if they brought his minigun back to it s old state  without the weird drop in accuracydamage for the 1st second of revup  and restore it s accuracy however  to balance it out  his minigun takes slightly longer to rev  about one second   it might need another change to keep it balanced  but i ll leave that up to your discussion ,465nmf,tf2,gaming,1455670915.0,CaptainKappa14,5.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0

heavy is pretty balanced  and heavy is pretty powerful at last in 6s even in pubs  a heavymedic combination can dominate the playing field perhaps more weapon choices for the heavy would be nice  but i think buffing him would be too much ,d02nr59,tf2,gaming,1455672717.0,AgentMafia,2.0,0.0,764.0,3007.0,1.0
i think the passive 20  damage resistance would nt be broken it s only active while he s spun down completely  not when he s spinning up or down it would help him with his survivability  since he s pretty much everyone s bullet whore i wish there was a way to test this  like a mod of some sorts heavy s health regen would be slow  but could definately help in situations where he does nt have a sandvich  although a heavy without a sandvich is stupid his real problem is his survivability is overestimated by valve heavy can take hits  but not as well as he should ,d02o8vh,tf2,gaming,1455673462.0,CaptainKappa14,1.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0
problem with heavy is he is either underpowered or he gets something like banners and it is a case of  lol fuck you i have damage resistance  speed and regenerating hp  as a pyro i know damnrightly how it feels to be underpowered  but killing a heavy can be much harder than you heavy mains think and when you have a medic you are already nigh impossible to kill  i really do nt think any more speed or damage resistance changes need to be made  it is why those weapons are options in the first place  just equip stock and gru if you want speed and damage resistance i do like the spin up and crouched idea though ,d02nmw8,tf2,gaming,1455672541.0,Pyrimo,0.0,0.0,1.0,724.0,0.0

after reading the cactus canyon thread  where it s in beta since forever   i have a few ideas for our beloved tf2 team to repurpose more of the beta and empty servers  1  one is as i had mentioned in other threads  an other mode  server which would host tc  arena  pd maps  and take out doomsday and put into these ones that itself would be enough of a map cycle to constitute a large enough server for people to play on these do nt need much since not a lot of people would play it  but maybe at most 15  of the valve servers would be enough for this  2  another idea is to make beta servers  currently only for 247 asteroid and cc  for workshop maps that are in beta status unfortunately  custom maps do nt get much shine  as most people would just play whatever map that s in valve servers currently only nonvalve servers  ie community or custom servers  have custom maps  and a good percentage of them are established custom maps that had been played for a long time or tf2mapsnet s gamedays or people would just download the map and check themselves  at this point  after 3  or 4 if you count halloween 2015  contracts you start to see some of the issues pop up unfinished andor not wellbalancedwip maps are becoming official and while new maps being added officially is always nice  the tough break ones have exploits  readjustments  missing things happen in the maps  personally i feel that it s because these maps do not get played much by a larger pool of players  or at all by the general public that any feedback to the map makers are slow or very few that the mapmaker could nt get enough feedback to improve on hisher map note that at this point i am not saying the tf2 mapping community by itself is bad  they are an excellent bunch that makes maps for a game that s been almost out for 10 years there s also map critique people who goes thru the maps thoroughly  i did some before when i was active in tf2maps   but sometimes  perhaps more voices being heard is a good thing  which is why i want to suggest that valve make beta workshop map rotations  say 23 maps a quarteryear or every 2 months put into beta servers along with asteroid and cc  sorry 247ers   this also utilizes the workshop feature of steam where you would subscribe to these maps as well  and then you can go to the workshop page for feedback after playing them on the valve beta servers so far most workshop comments are  this looks cool  and some occasional feedback about the map itself  or a spooky skeleton so adding them to valve servers would add a lot more exposure to the mapmaker on getting more feedback  of any type  mind you   which allows himher to use the feedback to fix or improve the map  however this involves a bit more work from the tf2 team to go thru the workshop maps and decide which maps to put in the servers and the quality varies by a lot  so i think the map should at least be in beta status  and it s recommended that it also has a tf2mapsnet map thread opened as well    tl  dr    1 add other modes  servers 2 add workshop maps into beta servers on a bimonthlyquarterly rotation for better custom map quality what do you guys think  edit  some wordings added,4623uh,tf2,gaming,1455623204.0,penpen35,23.0,0.0,2862.0,4581.0,0.0

guys  we got ta really look at what has been added into team fortress 2 these past years passes  now i now what you re wondering  cherry  why do passes matter so much to this discussion    well  let s take a look at what has happened in the recent few months  it has been 3 years since we got a major  content wise update given to mann vs machine  not counting the update adding the ability to find aussies in any advanced or expert tour this already gave me a bad feeling why bother adding new maps if you can find the aussies on any advanced or expert tour now  what new prize can we introduce that can top an australium weapon  i do nt know  maybe adding more australium themed weapons  they ve only scratched the small surface of australiums  acting as if  hey  that s it guys we ca nt top the golden pan anymore   so what  i do nt want a golden pan i want a golden degreaser or golden jagsomething  cosmetics have dropped in the amount we ve gotten in crates or updates the last update we got that had a high number of cosmetics was the smissmas 2014 update  two years ago remember when you had to deal with waiting for the price to drop on the most popular hat  remember when you actually had the chance to get the most popular hat  remember when they provided other hats as well to deal with the popular ones  and actually gave more community members a chance to get their work in the game  weapons i m not sure if i wan na touch this one i understand it s hard to create new weapons and put them into the game  with having to balance them  make them coexist with other weapons and work with other weapons  reskins here we go remember when they gave us a reskin but than put them in the craft or drop system  so what do all these have to do with passes  ai nt it obvious  as grampa soldier once said  it s the oldest trick in the book money   with passes  all you have to do is just  make your own skins  slap a rarity system from cs  go on them  do the same with cosmetics  and you re set for life  why do i have to shell out 32 cosmetics that i get profit from the crate opening be slightly rare  when i can bump the rarity to a high tier strange or unusual  why unbox 3 or 4 crates when we can get those youtube unboxing tier unboxs  why make a slight profit off a reskin than release it into the craft and drop system  when i can say it s elite or commando grade  and keep making money off the unboxes  in conclusion from what i ve observed  valve does nt want to put in the time and effort for the community to actually make improvements on old gamemodes and weapons  when they can just shell out the cs  go system instead  the real question is  who is to blame  was it the corporation wanting to make more money for themselves  or was it the response to a community who used to ask when the new weapon would be out  we are sick of hats  whens the new map  now i ll admit  passes have brought in a few new maps and another chance for the creative side of the community to shine with weapon skins and maps however  some stuff like weapon rarity or cosmetic rarity might turn content creators away or prevent them from getting a chance to be put into team fortress 2  this has all just been my opinion throughout the years of team fortress i ve been playing  and i m kinda sad to see the  old  way of updates slowly fading away  leave your thoughts in the comments below  positive or negative ,464y80,tf2,gaming,1455661210.0,CherryThePanPyro,4.0,0.0,342.0,923.0,0.0

i really do hope we start to get old crates back i really do nt like the idea of paying six dollars  just to pay even more money to unbox and after 850 spent i get a 10 cent skin  it s the reason i did nt buy either pass when they came out i loved gun mettle because it was quite possibly the only update since pyromania that did nt shit on pyro  but unfortunately valve went back on themselves to their pyro nerfing ways when tough break came out i feel like the aspects of the updates that worked were nt even new to begin with  adding maps  changing stats etc  whereas all of the stuff that is actually new  i in fact do nt like to begin with i could nt care less about a flamer skin when i ve got my massively decked out degreaser and i m not forking out a ton of money just to open shitty event specific crates  so in truth  when it boils down to it the only new thing that is somewhat good is the contracts and considering you pay 6 dollars for most of your awards to be said cashgrab cratesno thanks valve  tweak the contracts and give us back old crates please not only that but i was sorely dissapointed this christmas  what could of been a simple 250 to get some new festives  would of died happy for a festive degreaser  instead was 850 for a shitty skin that i would nt of wanted so ruining smissmas is another reason i hate the new system  psfor the love of fuck valve  fix axtinguisher ,d02o4jl,tf2,gaming,1455673282.0,Pyrimo,1.0,0.0,1.0,724.0,0.0

the basic idea of  lets put grades on items   is a fine idea  it s just that valve did nt play out the idea correctly they did it  but they did nt do it  good   i think the root of the problem is that the main focus of gun mettle was rebalances  maps  and introducing contracts so the skins and the grades were kind of lazily put together  and people were so quick to ask for a gun mettle 2 that valve just ended up copying and pasting everything into tough break  so  tough break resulted in really sloppy rebalances  4  arguably  poorly made maps  and the only real highlight of the update was betterlooking skins  if we put gun mettle and tough break against each other  gun mettle would win every time  because gm completely  transformed  tf2 if you showed august 2015 tf2 to february 2015 tf2  people would go nuts but  if you showed january 2016 tf2 to october 2015 tf2  they would nt because tough break did nt really shake the game up  it just sort of stuck some sticks in the game and said   eh  that s good   i really think after match making is released  we ll see the  old  style updates return at least  i hope that s the case  because if things stay this way tf2 might really lose its spirit for me  which is probably why scream fortress 7 was my favorite update of 2015  ,d02ipj6,tf2,gaming,1455664871.0,GhoulBones,5.0,0.0,24.0,117.0,0.0

personally i do nt really care if i die by a random crit  sure i may have been winning the fight but thats just what i have come to expect from tf2 i just deal with it and continue playing  its not something worth crying over  i think some people exaggerate a bit when it comes to the topic of random crits   i feel dirty when i get a kill with a random crit   really  do you  its a game  if you do nt like them then play on servers with them disabled  of course remove them from matchmaking as that is actually a skill based mode but i think they should stay in valve servers ,d01fxjb,tf2,gaming,1455590664.0,xPhilip,8.0,0.0,545.0,1447.0,0.0
spawn timers are carefully tuned for game balance  attackers have shorter respawn timers than defenders  times vary between maps and points based on how long it takes to get back in the action and how easy it is to take a point  good players can use respawn timers to track enemy position  eg a spy just died  you estimate when he ll spawn so you can guess where he s headed while invisible and know how long you have to worry before he s in position to do damage again  tweaking the system might be awkward with wave based spawns too that system is really good at forcing teamwork by having players spawn and push together most newbies that spawned alone would hold w as soon as they spawned even if their whole team was dead ,d013pyv,tf2,gaming,1455571618.0,UnoriginalUsername39,3.0,0.0,1.0,2989.0,0.0
