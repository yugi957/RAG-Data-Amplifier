this may vary depending on company  policy  and person but while i worked for xbox support call and chat i would do everything and some to make sure you were good if you acted like a decent person once i got a rude  brat or something if i was nt able to get you to calm down and act human i proceeded to not care and gave shitty help and worry about the other customers i had i just do nt want to deal with you  i do nt sympathize with you  i really just do nt care   i love my games and crap but i wo nt take it out on some stranger because it s just a game   like i play games a lot i know the need to be able to play still no reason to be an ass ,d01tiut,adviceanimals,humor,1455626368.0,MunkiiJunkii,1.0,0.0,8,273,0.0
there needs to be some sort of stipulationbecause they are only going to do what is within their power which is nt a whole lot  i think we all understand that the person on the other end of the phone is nt the cause  but it does nt change the fact that i m the customerclient  i mean if you are paying someone close to minimum wage  how much  power  do they really have  i get it  it does nt matter how high in the food chain you are  unless you are at the top you do nt necessarily have all the power  this is nt a put down of anyone that works in a call center  but if they ca nt solve my problem and continue to escalate my call to their supervisor who also ca nt solve my problemit s frustrating and annoying  my biggest problem is when the person on the other end tells me or implies that something is nt their job you do nt have to tell me this  tell me anything other than this  it just is nt something that flies and it s not something i ve ever told a clientcustomer i ve thought it plenty of times  but it s just unprofessional ,d01j40l,adviceanimals,humor,1455595758.0,ProfLiar,8.0,0.0,17,29996,0.0

not even close to universally true maybe there are some companies that encourage this  or individuals with a chip on their shoulder working in call centers who will do this  but i am never  ever rude on the phone and a vast majority of customer service reps stick to their script and toe the company line until i hang up it is only when i get audibly annoyed and ask for someone s boss that they start to think for themselves and try to actually help me out this advice mallard should just be  be kind and polite to everyone   not because it might inspire someone to actually do their fucking job  but because its the nice thing to do ,d01yovp,adviceanimals,humor,1455637183.0,sam_hammich,1.0,0.0,219,33970,0.0

hi  i have worked in wildlife rehab and can likely shed some light on this topic for those who do nt know one of the most common problems rehab facilities face is the process of imprinting an animal onto humans  or a lesser version of that where the animal just thinks that all humans are providers of food imagine releasing an imprinted bear  the bear thinks that he belongs with humans and will go try to find other humans to hang out with or score food from this is how  nuisance animals  are made  and you better believe people will call anybody to get this big fucking bear off their property  around me it is usually the dnr and in most cases it is putting the bear down this is why you see rehabers wearing costumes or masks when working with wildlife to be released so that animal does nt know what the big thing with the food is here is an example of people working with cranes  https  media2wnycorgi1200627c80photologueimages4bop_mig_crane_costumejpg people are nt perfect and there is a cute affectionate fox to be taken care of  and it s easier than you might imagine to imprint an animal onto people  especially when said animal is very young what most likely happened is that the workers spent too much time trying to play or cuddle with the little guy ,d02m9lk,adviceanimals,humor,1455670436.0,Bringer_of_Bears,111.0,0.0,96,799,0.0

a lot of call centers have a call limit and will disconnect calls when they reach that limit i worked at one place where if we had 200 calls in the queue  if you called it would let you through the automated system  24 minutes of time  and then disconnect you with no message at all it could have been handled better  but the intention was that if we had that many calls backed up it was either a massive service outage or it was gon na be 1 hour before you got talked to either way sucked for the customers ,d0268gv,adviceanimals,humor,1455647871.0,drixtol,7.0,0.0,2604,4800,0.0
