this is not even close to a facepalm the nazi s were indeed socialists not only was it in the name but their policies were incredibly socialist they banned land speculation  communalized large buildings  formed a nationwide government run union called deutsche arbeitsfront that was able to set wages implemented government run education and healthcare there was also a massive tax on corporate profits that was above 90  with only the largest companies being exempt  the largest companies being completely government run of course ,d02lso9,facepalm,humor,1455669712.0,HaydenGalloway8,1.0,0.0,1,90,0.0
first of all  they were national socialists second of all  why do people assume socialism  communism  which in this case it does nt because nazis hated communists  and visa versa and third  sanders is a democratic socialist  so a little different communism wants to get rid of the market completely and advocates for negative equality  no one can rise or better themselves socialism can be market friendly  with some limits as it should be  and supports positive equality  everyone gets the same opportunity to better themselves no matter their background ,d02r8ci,facepalm,humor,1455678081.0,IAteTheDingo,1.0,0.0,45,1880,0.0

internet etiquette 101    i can and will post anything i want and you will like it   it is your job to shower me compliments  so here are some tips  you re only allowed to care about my problems if it means you truly pity me and realize all of these problems are  totally  out of my control and i ve just been wronged by the world  you re only allowed to care about my triumphs if it means you re secretly jealous of me and realize i m  never  exaggerating and i ve never had any help from others  you re only allowed to disagree with me on anything if you play the devil s advocate and preface it by  you re right  but  something to make yourself look really dumb    and even then you re on thin ice  dickhead better to just not disagree with me to be safe  if you re a girl  any acknowledgement of my mere existence means you want to fuck me  failure to follow these simple rules means you re a troll ,d007g04,facepalm,humor,1455502567.0,Ron_Mexicos_Burnr,4.0,0.0,1,2563,0.0

being a male  i understand both side of this argument i do not agree with the idiot tho  so let me ask women a question and i do ask this because i am trying to understand not make people mad  if you are walking down the street at night and see a section of road ahead that has all street lights are out  do you stay on this side and walk thru the dark section  or do you cross to the other side that has appropriate lighting  i think most would cross to the other side because they notice an inherent danger  so  and assuming i am right about the answer above  why is it that women feel that they do not have to try to be safe at other times  the choosing to not be safe is  by drinking to a point where they are unable to notice dangerous situations  by teasing a man  not all men  but some  too far to the point where he has trouble controlling himself  also often brought on by alcohol   by allowing themselves to be duped or deceived into a false sense of safety by strangers  or friends of friends of friends that they barely know   and yes i ll say it by flaunting themselves in front of or directly to some more of the men  as described above   why is it that women can not or will not recognise the danger that exists when dealing with some men  you would not let your child play in a cage with a lion why the hell do you put yourself in that situation  no not all men are slaves to genetics  as in  male animals are dominant  over females  by the use of force and will do whatever is needed to get what they want   but in the same way not all lions will eat your child  you do nt know which ones are going to be dangerous till it s too late  discuss    edit   i am not saying all men are dangerous i am saying that some are  just like not all people are serial killers  some are  the inability for some people to control themselves makes them act in ways the our society has deemed unacceptable the rapist is no different than the serial killer or the mass murderer  they obviously have brain problems   they are bad people  but what i am trying so desperately to ask people to think about is  why do we not recognise danger in this way  we will avoid serial killers by listening to the details of where and how he gets his victims and stay away from those locations we generally tend to run from mass murderers rather than towards them why do we go into situations that present a real danger of being attacked or assaulted ,czz1btn,facepalm,humor,1455411456.0,Niith,-40.0,0.0,10,1839,0.0
