my pops found the neighbors dog outside his house one night  and even though it was late he thought it would be best to return him so he went and knocked on the elderly neighbor who owns pugs front door  11pm  and got no answer he hung out for a bit and tried ringing the doorbell again  still no answer  so he turns around to go and walk home and is met with two guns drawn police men who had been called by the old lady the old lady had both her pugs in the house  it was actually 3rd random pug he was trying to return that also lived in the neighborhood scary situation obviously because they had their guns out  but once they figured out what was going on everybody relaxed and were able to have a laugh over it the old lady neighbor ended up keeping the pug even though it was nt hers to return to the rightful owner in the neighborhood  who she knew  the next day i do nt know what the purpose of this post was ,d02rld8,funny,humor,1455678668.0,pineapplesmasher,10.0,0.0,2042,4686,0.0

i would solve this along a two axis subsystem  on one axis  we have old school  average and new school   unifying factor  stayed with the same interest since they discovered it   dividing factor  how much did they get beat up for what they did   usually  it helps to ask them  if they got beat up for what they did  or for what others thought they did   field test  ask them about geeknerddork culture old schoolers will sigh  and speak with the same attitude about conventions as someone who never was there  but who allways wanted to be there for them  what they did in the privcy of their own four walls was theirs alone to enjoy they may also say   hrk  you mean  popular culture    averages have a mixed opinion on it  on the one hand  they will detest their culture being trampled for the masses  and lots of people who never stood up and suffered for their culture coming in and taking the rudder of their favorite thing  on the other hand  they will appreciate the opportunity to be social new schoolers will most likely hand you the convention badges  list the panels they attended  and swoon over how they allmost go to meet their favorite creator of their field  on the second axis  we have  geek  dork and nerd   unifying factor  appreciation  dividing factor  did they have technical skill in their field  geek   encyclopedic knowledge  nerd   or a bit of both  dork    field test  hand them a computer game from a longer running series a geek will get in on the technical aspects of the game  and what fascinated him or her about it  or what sounds interesting a dork will try to sell you the computer game  either as a must have  or as a do not touch  or will try to sell you on their favorite of the genre a nerd will place the game within its episodical context  and dissect for you what changes made him or her like it more or like it less you will know more facts afterwards then you ever knew  these two acis are sufficient  in my personal experience  to define all the fields  mind you  dork is not used as a negative here a dork to a true geek is someone that can talk without people fleeing in panic  and to a nerd  a dork is a hundred times more approachable then a true geek heck  even nerds and geeks  natural enemies if left alone  can bond if a dork is present dorks are what holds the polar opposites together  if you want examples  geek  has rigged his mothers cable box to get all the channels  plus the pron channels  dork  has had to read the tutorials online  and has had to trouble shoot  but finally made it  nerd  does not need a cable box  due to having all his favorites archived  geek  played damp  d because you could so nicely fiddle around with the numbers  dork  played damp  d because roleplaying was an interesting idea  nerd  played damp  d because it justified why he had to buy all the books  geek  has hacked his favorite video game  or at least seriously tried to  dork  has bought a hack for his favorite video game  because you have to support the people behind this  nerd  uses cheats instead without looking them up  geek  uses linux does not understand where the use of an os woul be that teaches you nothing  and works out of the box  dork  uses apple it looks great  and yet you can do a lot of console work  nerd  uses windows  because  my collection requires it   could give to shits aboutr what the actual os is  as long as the collection is fine  geek  torrents movies after all  it is just some fiddling with the protocoll  dork  streams movies after all  it is convenient  nerd  owns everything needed on dvd  either bought or expertly archived does not care where it comes from  as long as it is high def and in pristine condition if pirated  once the money is there  it will be bought  geek  does not know the best friend on the internet is a woman could care less  dork  does know the best friend on the internet is a woman happy if she is not canadian  nerd  can base a convincing display of a woman on a lifetime of study most likely  has befriended geek and dork as women  because it would be too embarassing to admit what he is into  geek  makes people cringe when they realize what this person is capable of  dork  makes people cringe when he explains to them what he can do  knows  owns  nerd  makes people cringe when they realize that these bottles are not full with mountain dew  geek  has worked for four years with a woman on a project forgot about it  dork  has talked to a girl once that ws not related to him  nerd  gets in shouting matches with girls over trivia without realizing why people may find this douchey  geek  dreamjob is  something in ramp  d  dork  dreamjob is  something in nerd  geek  dork culture  nerd  dreamjob is librarian  archivar geek  ca nt cosplay for the life of him has build a to scale modell of his own lightsaber though dresses his tower up and takes pictures  dork  can cosplay makes his own costumes buys the occasional thing or two  nerd  takes photos of his favorite cosplay sorts them by how much they got right makes a fanpage for the best cosplayer  geek  has a bookshelf full of tech manuals knows what the ugly red book that wo nt fit on a shelf is dork  doies not own a bookshelf owns a kindle instead  nerd  has a bookshelf of his favorite nieche sorted alphabetically pristine condition only peasants buy one copy  master racers buy 2  one for the shelf  one for the day to day  geek  calls it animation has seen a few of everything  but lost interest  dork  wears a magical love gentlemen tshirt to school  nerd  calls it manga  anime has his favorite series ova  geek  actually has a japanese penpal that he writes to for tech problems in english  dork   ooomg  how kawaii desuu  do nt you think so as well  geek and dork senpai   nerd  has at least listened to the ova often enough to be able to pronounce common phrases like a native is ashamed he does not know more  geek  views geeks as the master race after all  we have job prospects  dork  views geeks as professionals sadly  they lack the social skills to make good use of it  nerd  views geeks the same way an art major would view a scientist who disassembles a painting to count molecules  geek  views dorks as people who may have had sex  dork  views dorks as a slur after all  they can be geeks  nerds as well  nerd  view geeks as the more understandable version of geeks lets them loan select parts of his collection  geek  views nerds as people who would collect  and actually read  user manuals dork  views nerds as super cool examples of the culture  nerd  views nerds as competition there can only be one  geek  ideal sunday consists of formatting the pc  and setting it up again  because it was beginning to throw errors  dork  ideal sunday consists of a convention spent talking to fellow nerds and geeks  nerd  ideal sunday consists of a binge session of their favorite product  geek rolemodell  steve wozniak  dork rolemodell  dr dr sheldon lee cooper nerd rolemodell  local librarian  comic book  anime fan club president geek  hidden talent  can actually draw pretty well  dork  hidden talent  has the uncanny ability to pick out something the person will
