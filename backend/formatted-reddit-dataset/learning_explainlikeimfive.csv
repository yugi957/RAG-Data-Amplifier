for any such number where there are units of measurement involved  like the speed of light  it s because the units are not derived from that phenomenon humans defined miles  kilometers  seconds  minutes  etc  first then we used them to describe the speed of light it s like measuring a random tree in the forest what are the chances it ll be precisely 30 meters tall  as for pi  which is a pure mathematical ratio  there s no explanation it just is what it is ,d02g32d,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455661036.0,respighi,14.0,0.0,7443,20303,0.0

there are a lot of reasons people faint  if you get hit hard enough  your brain may knock against the inside your skull and may shut down as a defense mechanism  you may have low blood pressure  which will caused oxygen supply to lower to the brain your brain responds by shutting down  you may be hyperventiliating  which also interferes with oxygen to the brain  what your brain does  is basically knocks you out so that you will become horizontal this will make it easier for your heart to pump oxygen to the brain fainting is  in this respect  a survival reflex  as for what it s like  it sucks i get vasovagal syncope from time to time  though now i know what triggers it  anxiety attacks  and how to combat them directly so it does nt happen anymore  i have no perception of the passing out  when i wake up  it s like everything is fuzzy and slow and really far away i am totally disoriented   to share an embarassing story  the first time it happened to me  i was on the toilet i was going through some weight loss  and had overdone it at the gym for a week and did nt eat enough i was at like 1800 calories and really should have been eating more like 2800 or more  so  on the toilet got dizzy got a stomache ache woke up totally freaking out and thinking i was gon na die  horrible  but  i saw a doctor  it happened again  and we talked about what was going on and how to prevent it ,d01ntei,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455605704.0,StumbleOn,35.0,0.0,25,67199,0.0

the mass migration is because the us congress passed a law that both required card companies to issue chipped cards  and holds merchants responsible if a stolen card is used in their store and it s swiped instead of put in the machine for the chip to be read  the current chip implementation  without a pin to back it up  is only useful in making it harder for a thief to use a cloned card  because they can still use it online  and they can still use the original chipped card if it is in their possession  which i feel is not worth the aggravation of having to deal with temperamental chip readers that ca nt read a card if it s even the tiniest bit dirty  last night  my card actually crashed the pos terminal  i ca nt imagine that this could even possibly happen with a normal swipe card ,d028hp0,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455650912.0,Reese_Tora,2.0,0.0,2820,26150,0.0

without the chip  any compromised terminal can copy the information on the card this allows for fraudulent payment even while the card holder maintains possession of the card  which means the fraud is often not discovered until much later the chip facilitates the use of encryption  so that the particular information from the card and the processor network received by the terminal are only valid for that specific transactionthe data can still be copied  but can not be used for new transactions and is therefore useless  the  mass migration  is because the credit card networks are now incentivizing merchants in the us to accept the chipif they do not  they bear the cost of fraud  and not the issuer  as with most fraud   so now not only will the issuers benefit from issuing chipenabled cards  but the merchants will want to accept and use those cards as well ,d023nf5,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455644353.0,TokyoJokeyo,17.0,0.0,24,32322,1.0

planes in the air are still affected by gravity in order for them to stay off the ground  a force has to be applied in the opposite direction of gravity  aka lift   now planes can get lift two ways the common way is using wings as air moves over the wings  the shape pushes most of it down increasing pressure under the wing and decreasing it above you can experience this yourself by sticking your hand out of a car window the second way in some jet powered aircraft  the force of the engine is enough to lift the plane without using wings this works the same way as letting go of the end of a balloon both of these are contingent on having enough air to either power the jet engine  or provide lift under the wings as planes fly higher  the air gets thinner until it is not enough to power the engines or provide enough lift under the wings to get to space  you need a rocket that brings its own air with it to power its engines,d02tylj,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455682679.0,Master-Potato,1.0,0.0,114,16146,0.0

when you say  clusters  are you more referring to galaxies  as in why do nt they continually disperse as the universe is accelerating  if so  then i ll say this we attribute  dark matter  as a force that pulls and keeps things together  like galaxies mathematical calculations reveal dark matter to amount to about 25  of all the mass in the universe  remember  mass has an equivalent energyforce  thanks to einstein   this is in contrast to  dark energy  which we call the force which pushes the universe apart and we attribute as the cause of the exponentially accelerating expansion of spacetime calculations reveal darn energy to amount to about 71  of the mass in the universe  we know these two things exist we call them  dark  because they do not interact in any manner of a directly observable spectrum  and in fact we ve yet to deduce a manner in which to measure them directly when you have a feeling something is there  but can not take a picture or measure to account for it  you carefully account for every single other variable that you can  whatever externalities left over which serve to unbalance your mathematical proofs afterward are thus  dark  but nonetheless must exist in some fashion  for instance  we know dark matter  pulling force  exists after a hubble experiment measures the speed at which stars in the milky way move around the galactic core logic says  the stars nearest to the core must be moving around the center at a higher rate if speed than those stars around the edges  as an analogy  hypothetically  imagine a hubcap on a car that has bolts right around the center and more bolts at the very edge of the rim  not very realistic  but moving on   you d imagine those those bolts right around the center of the rim are spinning at a faster velocity than those on the outside of the rim  moving at the same rpm but around a shorter distance stars in the milky way should follow suit  right    only they did nt all the stars  besides those in the immediate death zone proximity of the super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy  are rotating around at the same speed which  all else held relative  means there must be some external force  dark matter  outside the halo of the milky way which is  tugging  on all of the stars to maintain this equivalent speed crazy  right   we ca nt put it in a beaker and measure it directly  but we can observe and measure it s influence to some degree  sorry for the long winded response  i hope that this is nt too hard to digest and makes some sense ,d02vfbx,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455685365.0,SupremeWizardry,1.0,0.0,1,10511,0.0

the impetus for the pearl harbor attack was the us placing an oil embargo on japan  which pretty much  any  country 100  dependent on foreign sources for oil would consider an act of war  by attacking pearl harbor  they hoped to eliminate  or at least cripple the us pacific fleet naval combat was still a major  deciding force in those days they might not have actually thought they could invade the us and win  although the  did  manage to invade and hold one of the aleutian islands for a couple monthshardly the mainland   but they certainly hoped they could pull america s teeth in the pacific  but the raid was botched disastrously not only were all the allimportant aircraft carriers out to sea and thus spared  but even the bombing that did occur was not that effective only three ships were damaged beyond repair  perhaps even worse  the japanese attackers also failed to bomb the oil storage tanks near pearl harbor they knew about them  but had bought into the myth that america was awash in oil  and they felt it would be pointless in reality  those tanks represented pretty much all the oil for the pacific fleet  and if they d destroyed them  the fleet would have been essentially cut off from operating very far into the pacific for up to a year ,d02n3up,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455671753.0,DrColdReality,6.0,0.0,1,53378,1.0

first  this is changing pretty quickly lots of good breweries are canning these days my own research indicates that the canning line is more expensive to buy but has lower operating costs than a bottling line  as to why  good  beer has historically come in bottles rather than cans  it s mainly consumer perception  bottles just had more perceived quality than cans did if you are trying to sell beer for  10six rather than  6  you have to make the consumer feel like it s worth it  cans probably got a bad rap because when you drink straight from the container  they can make the beer taste tinny also  early cans were not as good as current cans  with coatings on the inside that could flake off  leading to tinny flavor even if you drank from a glass  it s the same reason that people preferred green glass over amber for a while  because the european imports they saw were in green glass  they associated that with a higherquality beer  even though beer in green glass skunks more easily a similar calculation goes into choosing pryoff caps over twistoffs  twistoffs are associated with cheap beer  so all the  good  breweries use pryoffs to differentiate their product ,d02g7gx,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455661208.0,NoLongerBetweenDogs,7.0,0.0,1,293,0.0

okay lets start with dimensions  yes we live in a universe with three physical dimensions the fourth dimension refers to time  or more specifically  causality  the process in which a transformation or change causes changes another change or transformation within the universe  basically the concept of cause and effect as causality determines the direction in which time flows  the important thing to realize here is that this model is what is defined by the standard model of physics  or our current accepted  interpretation  of physical laws of the universe various other theories such as the multiverse theories  string theory  supersymmetry theory  or super string theory offer varying interpretations of the physical laws which govern our universe now i use the word interpretation not as in that these laws or somehow not concrete or defined  they are definitely defined and established  it is simply how we connect these laws  in regards to the multiple universes  although our current model of physics does nt account for the existence of multiple universes in a multiverse  the other mentioned theories and models do i would recommend a book called hyperspace by michio kaku which explains multiverses  branes  higher dimensions  as well as many other topics in great depth  though with layman s terms so it is easy for average person to understand ,d02pzrd,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455676142.0,GreyGriffin98,2.0,0.0,1,706,0.0

there are a lot of reasons people faint  if you get hit hard enough  your brain may knock against the inside your skull and may shut down as a defense mechanism  you may have low blood pressure  which will caused oxygen supply to lower to the brain your brain responds by shutting down  you may be hyperventiliating  which also interferes with oxygen to the brain  what your brain does  is basically knocks you out so that you will become horizontal this will make it easier for your heart to pump oxygen to the brain fainting is  in this respect  a survival reflex  as for what it s like  it sucks i get vasovagal syncope from time to time  though now i know what triggers it  anxiety attacks  and how to combat them directly so it does nt happen anymore  i have no perception of the passing out  when i wake up  it s like everything is fuzzy and slow and really far away i am totally disoriented   to share an embarassing story  the first time it happened to me  i was on the toilet i was going through some weight loss  and had overdone it at the gym for a week and did nt eat enough i was at like 1800 calories and really should have been eating more like 2800 or more  so  on the toilet got dizzy got a stomache ache woke up totally freaking out and thinking i was gon na die  horrible  but  i saw a doctor  it happened again  and we talked about what was going on and how to prevent it ,d01ntei,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455605704.0,StumbleOn,35.0,0.0,25,67199,0.0

syncope or feinting is essentially when you lose consciousness as a result of low blood pressure to the brain there are quite a few reasons as to what can trigger a feinting spell but the most common type is called vasovagal syncope  the symptoms are usually a sense of feeling lightheaded  feeling like you are about to throw up and a general loss of visual acuity  grey vision  tunnel vision  before ultimately blacking outloss of muscle control  medically there is nothing preventing someone from dreaming but its not a guaranteed thingat least no more than having or remembering a dream when you fall asleep naturally curiously though some patients have reported  hearing  or at least being aware of conversations while unconscious ,d01o551,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455606619.0,Rawsharkbones,3.0,0.0,1,119,0.0

the biggest problem is that transistors  performance degrades with increased temperature the two key things that define a give transistor are its  threshold voltage   the voltage where it turns on  and its drive current  how much current it can provide when it is turned on hard   the big issue is that higher temperatures strongly degrade the  drive current   this reduces the transistor s ability to quickly turn on other transistors that it is connected to  so if an integrated circuit gets too hot  it will slow down below its rated speed at that point  circuits can fail to work as intended and all sorts of screwy behavior is possible the most likely problem  however  is memory corruption  in the cpu s internal caches   if you keep the temperature of the device below its rated value  then you should nt have to worry they are typically tested at hot temperatures to ensure that even when they get hot they will still meet timing that s why overclocking is possible if you keep the microprocessor cool  you can run it faster than its worstcase speed  even if you do nt run a microprocessor hot enough to misbehave  running any integrated circuit hot for long periods of time will tend to make it more likely to experience a reliability failure almost all of the failure mechanisms that affect such devices are accelerated by temperature the general rule of thumb is that for every 10 degrees c you elevate the temperature  you reduce the lifetime by a factor of 3  that was nt formerly too big of a deal  since most microprocessors had such good reliability that even if you reduced the lifetime by a large value  it would still last as long as you were likely to use it that really is nt so true these days it s gotten very hard to make parts that are high performance  cheap  and extremely reliable so the reliability margin has been reduced quite a bit   source  i m a former reliability engineer who worked with intel ,d01ivs7,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455595377.0,afcagroo,65.0,0.0,3029,66282,1.0

i could be wrong about this  finance major having taken only 4 total economics courses over my degree  so feel free to correct me  the value of a country s currency  say relative to the usd  is determined by how much people want to have that currency as you can imagine  people will only want that currency if they need to buy things that are denominated in that currency  because canada has a weak dollar  relative to the usa  and it wishes to purchase a lot of things that are denominated in usd  a good idea would be to strengthen its currency  but how do you do that  well  you increase the demand for canadian dollars  or alternatively  reduce the supply of canadian dollars  by selling its gold reserves  presumably in exchange for canadian dollars that it will remove from circulation in the market  it will result in a strengthening of the canadian dollar  so that we can buy all that cool stuff that the americans produce  sidenote  this is also why you always hear talk about china  cheating  the currency system china produces a ton of things that people want to buy  which are denominated in china s currency  so you would think there would be a very high demand for their currency  and thus a strong currency but that is nt the case the reason why is china prints a lot of money first of all  but also  when you purchase their stuff  the government will use a lot of that money to buy  opposite of canada  precious minerals to keep the value of their currency low  since there is a huge supply of their currency in the market  they do this so that they can keep the value of their currency low so that the value of their goods remain cheap for purchasers  which result in a huge trade surplus for the country this works for them since they generally do nt buy a lot from other countries  but when they do buy stuff it s extremely expensive ,d023e9k,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455644004.0,sureves,1.0,0.0,1,28,0.0

in addition to untitleddocument37 s info on addressing  i would like to add some more information about how this complex process works  the main thing to realize is that your phone can only  yell  so loud to the tower there may only be a couple of towers that can even  hear  your phone nearby  you must also realize that your phone does nt so much  yell  at the towers the way we would  it more chirps it sends an incredibly fast burst of data to the tower the tower can be set up to only listen at specific time slots  and the phones know this  so all the phones are chirping at different times to make sure they are nt chirping all at once frogs do this in a swamp when they are croaking to find a mate if everyone talked at once  nobody could hear anything at all  not only are all of our phones chirping at the towers at different time slots  they can also be using a different  pitch  or frequency  the tower s  ear  can selectively listen to a small frequency range  or  pitch   kinda how you can tune someone out when they are asking you to take out the garbage and you are listening to a video or song instead  imagine how much different a piano song would sound if you could only hear two or three individual notes if everyone could only hear their own few note range  a piano tune would sound completely different to all of them  these are gross simplifications of what the towers do to get your data to you and not have it collide with someone else s data  tldr  phone s do nt broadcast that loud and try to talk on different frequencies at different times to avoid collisions ,d02s9zu,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455679791.0,Abe_Odd,1.0,0.0,30,4913,0.0

let s simplify this a bit for the sake of the explanation  assume that the airline has one ticket available for the flight you  and another 10 people are interested in this ticket the airline will sell its only ticket to the person that is first in line  you everyone else can not buy the ticket now  and they leave  a few days later  you decide that you do not want to travel on this ticket  you either want to return it  or exchange it for a different flight in this case  the airline has to refund you your money  or give you another ticket  but most importantly  they are now stuck with a ticket that people used to want in the past they have to wait until one of the previous 10 people realizes that the ticket is for sale before they can sell it again in this case  your action inconveniences the airline  not just as a cost of updating the list  which is relatively easy   but because they thought they had made a sale when in reality they did nt  now scale that up from one person to a full planeful of people the airline wants to make sure that when they fill up a plane  they have it filled up  and there will be no last minute surprises to dissuade you from returning the ticket  they will make it completely nonrefundable  so they wo nt care if the seat flies empty  it s already been paid for  or they will charge you a fee to changecancel the ticket  so they make some money back for the inconvenience you caused them ,d02t8us,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455681421.0,person95,1.0,0.0,28,6549,0.0

there are two situations you could be referring to and the odds are if you re confused it s because you re conflating the two there are  punts  and  kickoffs    a  punt  is when the team with the ball is on it s fourth down  and rather than risk turning the ball over to the other team after their next play  they opt to punt it back to the other team instead the ball will end up back an additional 3040 yards  but it ll end up in the other team s possession the offensive team snaps the ball back to a guy standing behind the line  the punter    he catches the ball  drops is from chestheight  and then kicks it downfield   http  i880photobucketcomalbumsac6cmpainpuntgif   a  kickoff  is when the offensive team has just scored  either by touchdown or field goal  and now the ball goes to the other team they put the ball on a tee at the 35yard line  and a guy standing about 15 yards behind the ball  the kicker    takes a running start and kicks it as far as he can down the field   https  mediagiphycommedia5xtdarzcaams4luhyeigiphygif  why am i making this distinction  because  the rules of football differ depending on which play is being run   specifically they differ on what happens if nobody from the other team touches the ball during a punt or a kickoff if nobody touches the ball during a  punt   the ball eventually comes to a stop at that point the play is whistled  dead  and the ball s awarded to the receiving team at the spot the ball stopped moving  if nobody touches the ball during a  kickoff   the ball remains live in fact  if a member of the   kicking team   grabs the ball   subject to certain rules  that go beyond an eli5  then they get the ball  so a member of the receiving team really needs to grab the ball  so with that in mind  here are the decisions to be made    during a punt     punt into the end zone   if the punt goes very deep  like past the receiving team s ten yard line  then it s in real danger of going into the end zone if it does  then the receiving team is awarded the ball on the 20 yard line so the punt returner  the guy who s job it is to catch the punt  will often just let the ball drop amp  bounce  hoping it goes into the end zone and they can get the ball on the 20 without a fuss this is a good deal for the receiving team  if the ball would have been caught at the 5  and you offered them a guaranteed 15yard return with a guarantee of nothing bad  fumbles  injuries  etc  happening  they d sign up    punt fair caught   if the punt goes very   high    and it s in no danger of going into the end zone  then often it gets fair caught it s very high  so it hangs up there a while  giving the punting team plenty of time for their guys to get downfield right next to the returner and they re getting all set to line up and take the guy s head off to avoid this the punt returner waves his arms like he s flagging a passing car  and then catches the punt where it s going to first hit the ground the opposing team is nt allowed to touch him but he s not allowed to run with the ball since he probably would ve gotten obliterated the moment he caught the ball  and maybe something bad happens  fumble  injury  etc   this is nt a bad deal    punt allowed to bounce   sometimes the returner does nt have a good play to make  either a fair catch or a return  so instead he just stays out of the way and the punt bounces mostly it bounces forward  good for the punting team  but sometimes backwards it   is    after all  an oddly shaped ball eventually the ball stops moving and it is awarded to the receiving team at the spot it stops moving or  if the punting team touches it  it stops there at that spot    punt returned   sometimes the returner catches the ball and runs it back    during a kickoff     kickoff into the end zone   if the kickoff ends up in the end zone  the ball still needs to be fielded by the receiving team but once they do the returner can  take a knee  and the ball is advanced to the 20 yard line  just like a punt into the end zone    kickoff through the end zone   this is the exact same result  only no kneeldown because it s impossible to field the ball in the field of play    kickoff returned   this is the only realistic other outcome  during a kickoff there is no fair catch but that s mostly because the defenders have a much longer way to run to get to the guy catching the ball during kickoffs  so there s less need to protect the guy and they never let the kickoff bounce  or if they do  they pick it up asap  because a kickoff is fair game for either team ,d02fjrm,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455660286.0,garrettj100,9.0,0.0,112,5826,0.0

if the ball hits the end zone or go past it  the receiving team automatically start on their 20 yard line the receiver of the ball makes a quick judgement on the people rushing at him and based on his perception if he can get catch the ball and run it past the 20th yard line if he can and there are no dangers of defenders forcing a fumble he would go for it  if he predicts the defenders will get to him too quickly  he might wave his arms indicating to everyone that it is a  fair catch   which is an agreement that he would attempt to gain more yards other than where he catches the ball  and in return the defenders wouldnt try to tackle him  if he doesnt go for the fair catch and he miscalculated and the defenders are closer than antipated  he might take the knee as soon as he catches the ball to end the play so he doesnt chance getting injured or fumbling the ball away ,d02d0qn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656918.0,therealgillbates,1.0,0.0,1,23264,0.0

in addition to the other answers  it s worth noting that unlike in many other sports  colliding with your opponents is just bad strategy in rugby in a scrum  you lock shoulders with your opponents in a controlled manner in open play  you re typically trying to grab hold of someone who s trying to dodge you  which normally means going for the legs  and new rugby players are taught to aim for the legs or waist when tackling  a typical rugby tackle involves wrapping your arms around the opponent s legs and causing them to trip over your arms as a result   additionally  much less tackling goes on in rugby than in american football because you only tackle the person who currently has the ball  there s no blocking going on of the nonballcarrying members of the team  one of the rules of rugby is  approximately  that at all times you must either be behind the person carrying the ball from your team s point of view  or trying to get behind the person carrying the ball so the opponent carrying the ball is the only one that you can legally reach  the others are further back because they have to be behind from their point of view   and if your team has the ball  you ca nt tackle anyone ,d02noye,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455672626.0,ais523,1.0,0.0,499,3415,0.0

wearing protective gear allows people to tackle each other with much greater force although the protective gear protects from the primary impact  your body actually ends up absorbing more concussive force i ll relate this to boxing  as i m more familiar with it and can explain it better that way  something similar happens in fighting in you strike someone in the head with a bare fist  you will cause more surface damage  bruises  split eyebrows  etc maybe even broken bones however  if you hit someone while wearing a boxing glove  2 things happen 1  you hit harder  because there is nt much chance of injuring your own hand and 2  the cushioning does nt disperse much of the force on the surface instead  that force is transmitted through the entire head with a hard enough hit  your brain will actually impact with the inside of your skull  possibly causing a concussion for this reason  boxing gloves are considered protection for the person wearing them  not for the person being hit  the same thing happens with football the protective gear allows you to actually deal more damage it protects the person who is doing the tackling moreso than the person being tackled ,d02t4px,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455681221.0,AssBlaster_69,1.0,0.0,99,13052,0.0

back in the day  only the nobility was educated kings and dukes would pay scholars to live in their castles and share knowledge with their kids  and those scholars would take on apprentices and teach them  typically from the clergy  as the nobility expanded  someone came up with this neat idea called a university basically a boarding school  you d send your kids off there until you felt like having them back  often late into life part finishing school  part general studies  part daycare for princes  these places were pretty popular  helping nobles to stay ahead of the curve on technology and history rulers need to know about literally everything  so literally everything a ruler might need to know was taught  at the same time  churches started to provide basic schooling for commoners  no more than a primary education  it was still helpful to have farmers that could read state proclamations or the bible  and who could do some quick math to guess how many eggs they had to sell or how much wheat  in order to make more schools  they needed more and more teachers  who would up getting to go study with nobles in universities if they were bright enough to become university teachers by the mid 20th century  university became a way for the best and brightest to go meet the wealthy and powerful  gaining tremendous opportunity  then  in the 80s  people started to get this idea that university was the key to a better life for everyone we all wanted to go  instead of just the idle rich and the scholarship geniuses we started to borrow money to go  but fundamentally  university is still what it always was  a place for the idle rich to learn a little of everything so that they could have intelligent conversations with their advisers and ministers  so  basically  a better question is  why in the heck do they teach 3d animation in a university  that should be a trades course in a technical college  and should not have electives ,d0197gl,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455579988.0,alexander1701,6.0,0.0,314,73470,1.0

for a long time  ireland was ruled by britain  and treated very badly indeed one of the worst events was the famous potato famine  caused by very unfair agricultural policies and practices imposed by the british  who then refused to help  most of ireland was  logically enough  ethnically irish  most of the irish were catholics and  well  really wanted to be independent of britain but there was also an ethnic group that traces its ancestry from what is now scotland  they were protestant and loyal to the british crown these people are concentrated in the north of the island  the fight for independence was partially successful most of ireland gained its independence and became a republic but part of the north remained under british rule  with a roughly 5050 split between catholics and protestants  which means it was a roughly 5050 split between republicans and loyalists  so there was now a province where half the population was passionately in favour of remaining british  and half the population was passionately in favour of joining ireland  a real loselose situation because whatever you did  half the population would be violently opposed to it  essentially  extremists on both sides took up arms against each other  and so there were a few decades of bombing campaigns  shootings and so on eventually  though  the british government managed to broker a deal that northern irish politicians on both sides felt able to work with  and things have quietened down considerably  there are still a few problems  though a small number of very radical extremists still want to continue the fight  and the loyalists will insist on antagonising people by parading through catholic areas of certain cities and there s still the issue that half the population is nt happy with the status quo  although for the most part civilians just want to be left in peace ,d01san8,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455622156.0,rewboss,3.0,0.0,626,32182,0.0

to understand the modern troubles  and to appreciate why it was so violent you have to look at the history as far back as the 12th century when ireland was invaded by the normans this was the start of direct english rule  this established a deep running hatred in many native of the native irish people  who felt they were being oppressed and they had nt the cohesion at that time to fight back matters didnt get any better and when henry viii came to the throne in england and started the english reformation  and his own branch of protestantism  he proclaimed himself king of ireland and tried to impose the protestant beliefs on irish people  the majority of whom were catholic peasants  the reformation failed in ireland and this lead to a campaign known as the plantation  in which many english and scottish protestants were promised some of the most fertile and prosperous land in ireland  at the expense of many of the native irish farmers at this point tensions had increased between the protestant and catholic sides  who were typically seen as english and native irish respectively  and sometimes still are by the more narrow minded people  the tension culminated in various re occurring conflicts that became part of the tapestry of irish  and then northern irish culture  again things did not get any better  irish people were considered second class to protestants  and were not even granted full rights until the catholic emancipation in 1829  the irish potato famine had further negative effect on relations also as the english government of the time had an economic policy of  laisser faire   meaning to let be implying they would not get involved in economic issue that they believed should right themselves in time  tensions and conflicts came to a head in 1922  after the irish war of independence and the angloirish treaty  most of ireland seceded from the united kingdom to become the independent irish free state  which after the 1937 constitution  began to call itself ireland  the six northeastern counties  known as northern ireland  remained within the united kingdom the irish civil war followed soon after the war of independence the history of northern ireland has since been dominated by sporadic sectarian conflict between  mainly catholic  irish nationalists and  mainly protestant  unionists this conflict erupted into the troubles in the late 1960s  so to understand why it may have been so violent at times  you have to appreciate that this conflict had been building up and even ongoing for some 700 years and while many counties of ireland split from the uk  many catholic irish  people were stuck in a uk controlled northern ireland and were reluctant to leave their homes  and this sentiment was shared by the protestant british  who at this point had been living in ireland for many years also ,d01smrn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455623428.0,Tongston,42.0,0.0,1,180,0.0

you can drink enough alcohol before you pass out  or without even passing out if you ve been drinking habitually for long enough  to raise the alcohol level in your blood high enough that it depresses the function of certain parts of the brain enough that it just stops telling the lungs to breathe or the heart to pump that does nt happen with marijuana because 1  you ca nt imbibe that much to begin with  2  the level of thc in your blood can only get so high and it is nt high enough to cause that effect  and 3  studies suggest that marijuana depresses with a different mechanism than alcohol and no amount of thc can cause that effect  which is nt to say that you ca nt kill yourself with marijuana  just that the death wo nt be directly attributable to overdose if nothing else  too much marijuana can make you pass out when you really need to be awake  like when driving or when the house catches on fire ,d00jzxz,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455536992.0,troycheek,28.0,0.0,28,9971,0.0

in addition to the other answers  it s worth noting that unlike in many other sports  colliding with your opponents is just bad strategy in rugby in a scrum  you lock shoulders with your opponents in a controlled manner in open play  you re typically trying to grab hold of someone who s trying to dodge you  which normally means going for the legs  and new rugby players are taught to aim for the legs or waist when tackling  a typical rugby tackle involves wrapping your arms around the opponent s legs and causing them to trip over your arms as a result   additionally  much less tackling goes on in rugby than in american football because you only tackle the person who currently has the ball  there s no blocking going on of the nonballcarrying members of the team  one of the rules of rugby is  approximately  that at all times you must either be behind the person carrying the ball from your team s point of view  or trying to get behind the person carrying the ball so the opponent carrying the ball is the only one that you can legally reach  the others are further back because they have to be behind from their point of view   and if your team has the ball  you ca nt tackle anyone ,d02noye,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455672626.0,ais523,1.0,0.0,499,3415,0.0

wearing protective gear allows people to tackle each other with much greater force although the protective gear protects from the primary impact  your body actually ends up absorbing more concussive force i ll relate this to boxing  as i m more familiar with it and can explain it better that way  something similar happens in fighting in you strike someone in the head with a bare fist  you will cause more surface damage  bruises  split eyebrows  etc maybe even broken bones however  if you hit someone while wearing a boxing glove  2 things happen 1  you hit harder  because there is nt much chance of injuring your own hand and 2  the cushioning does nt disperse much of the force on the surface instead  that force is transmitted through the entire head with a hard enough hit  your brain will actually impact with the inside of your skull  possibly causing a concussion for this reason  boxing gloves are considered protection for the person wearing them  not for the person being hit  the same thing happens with football the protective gear allows you to actually deal more damage it protects the person who is doing the tackling moreso than the person being tackled ,d02t4px,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455681221.0,AssBlaster_69,1.0,0.0,99,13052,0.0

midnight is always in the middle of the night in 90  of the world if we started the day at sunset or sunrise  those always change in every place around the world midnight  wherever you go  will always be at nighttime  well  because its the middle of the night you ll never go somewhere at midnight and have it be day   except in select parts of the world  i know   it s also relevant because if we  did  choose to start it at sunrise  because of that changing  it would throw off the date system keep in mind we cant just change how long a year is or how long a day is a day will always be 24 hours  no matter what units you use to measure it a year will always be 365 days  because thats what we calculated for the rotation around the sun and the rotation of the earth  etc so basically its so that its a constant night and so we didnt throw off the dating system and so that it provides an accurate calendar system ,d02po7s,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455675641.0,DestinyPvEGal,1.0,0.0,10,1033,0.0
midnight is the opposite of noon  noon is the time when the sun is at it s highest point during the day amp  in the middle of the sky it s a consistent reference point throughout the year  as long as you re not fucking with time zones but those did nt exist until the 1600s   in contrast  sunrise amp  sunset move by several hours throughout the year  so  we ve got 1 natural fixed point of reference  noon  and a fixed point of reference derived from that  midnight it would make sense to label one of these as the start of your day placing the boundary between days at noon just makes everything messy amp  complicated because it s the  middle  of the day most people are asleep at midnight  especially true before electricity  so it s much more practical to use that as the dividing line ,d02uqej,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455684072.0,ameoba,1.0,0.0,1255,209550,1.0

because the ball is an oblong shape  and on a kick it is tumbling end over end  it is very difficult to catch securely also on a kick you have guys coming in at you at full speed  as opposed to a normal play where they would be coming at you much more slowly because of these two facts  if a defender is able to time it so that he can hit you within a second of you touching the ball  there is almost no way you will be able to hold onto it  which means it will probably be a turnover and a score for the other team that is why quite often a player will call for a fair catch on a punt  as for letting it bounce  the most common reason for this is because if it bounced into the endzone  you get the ball at the 20 yard line if you were to instead catch it inside the five  you probably wo nt be able to advance very far if at all  so the 20 is much better  so the player has to make a judgement call of whether or not it will reach the endzone  and then there is taking a knee this only occurs on kickoffs  as opposed to punts   one a kickoff  when you catch it in the endzone you have the option of either taking a knee and having the ball at the 20  or you can try to make it as far as you can hoping to get beyond the 20 on a kickoff it is much more reasonable to hope to get farther than the 20 than it would be on a punt because the opposing team is usually much farther away and you have more blockers still though it is a judgement call by the receiver  depending on how long the ball was in the air and how far back in the endzone it is ,d02co3p,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656444.0,bjb406,1.0,0.0,465,8453,0.0

the japanese army commanders were traditionalist  hidebound  and not very wellversed in foreignwestern cultures they were of the belief that wiping out the us navy would eventually force the us into a truce  where japan got to keep their gains in asia  the japanese navy commanders were more educated  with many of their senior people having been educated in britain and the us  and they told the army commanders that this plan would not work and that the us would not sign a truce after being sneakattacked  unfortunately for everyone involved  the japanese army gained the upper hand in the empire s internal politics  and the japanese navy was basically ordered to come up with a plan to do what they d already said would fail  the attack on pearl harbor was their best shot at putting the army s strategy into action and trying to quickly smash the us navy ,d02mo83,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455671080.0,Paid_Internet_Troll,10.0,0.0,151,10725,0.0
the impetus for the pearl harbor attack was the us placing an oil embargo on japan  which pretty much  any  country 100  dependent on foreign sources for oil would consider an act of war  by attacking pearl harbor  they hoped to eliminate  or at least cripple the us pacific fleet naval combat was still a major  deciding force in those days they might not have actually thought they could invade the us and win  although the  did  manage to invade and hold one of the aleutian islands for a couple monthshardly the mainland   but they certainly hoped they could pull america s teeth in the pacific  but the raid was botched disastrously not only were all the allimportant aircraft carriers out to sea and thus spared  but even the bombing that did occur was not that effective only three ships were damaged beyond repair  perhaps even worse  the japanese attackers also failed to bomb the oil storage tanks near pearl harbor they knew about them  but had bought into the myth that america was awash in oil  and they felt it would be pointless in reality  those tanks represented pretty much all the oil for the pacific fleet  and if they d destroyed them  the fleet would have been essentially cut off from operating very far into the pacific for up to a year ,d02n3up,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455671753.0,DrColdReality,6.0,0.0,1,53378,1.0
just to add to the already great explanations  the japanese also believed if their attack went according to plan  it would take years for the us navy to be rebuilt to the same strength  turns out  they were able to rebuild in the matter of months  also  their plan included that they would have been able to destroy the aircraft carriers in the harbor fortunately they were out at sea during the attack,d02ns59,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455672759.0,Amongg,6.0,0.0,125,1644,0.0
so my understanding is that japan needed oil to get oil they needed to take some of the islands around indonesia to do this they needed to eliminate the americans in the philippines rather than a straight up fight they went with a surprise attack it worked they crippled our force  and were able to defeat us in the philippines and eventually take pretty much the entire pacific  so how did the us win  well  no one knew how effective aircraft carriers would be  and the american carriers survived pearl harbor also  pearl harbor was fairly shallow some of the ships could nt be salvaged  but a lot of the ships were salvaged no one really understood just how effective america could be at producing things the pocket battleship comes to mind also  the us was able to close the technological gap with the japanese zero  finally  war is an interesting concept the us was unwilling to except anything less than unconditional surrender when everything was going well for the japanese  before the battle of midway  they probably would have taken much worse terms if the us had sued for peace probably just guam and the philippines of course i am just speculating here that is the thing about war not all wars are fought to annihilate your enemy japan really wanted to fight the us briefly and win mild territorial gains i have heard a strong case that the yom kippur war was really about the arabs trying to get a better deal when they sued for peace than they had after the six days war it worked you do not always have to win a war to win a war ,d02psyn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455675847.0,Black__Hand,5.0,0.0,1,1004,0.0

no  they did not actually believe they could beat the us in the sense of taking over the united states and occupying it  that was nt their goal they were on a conquest in asia that was quite successful  but the allied powers were getting unhappy about it despite having their hands full taking control of pearl harbor would have seriously undermined us influence in the pacific  and made the us attacks on japan much more difficult and they almost did it japan may have been much much bigger if they won ,d02muo9,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455671359.0,slash178,1.0,0.0,2010,41764,0.0

japan had one major experience fighting a western power  the russojapanese war in 1904  japan and russia were arguing over influence in korea and manchuria russia refused a deal  and so japan launched a surprise naval attack against the russian eastern fleet a few hours before declaring war  sound familiar yet    the japanese sunk or crippled several of the russian battleships  and it led to the russians staying in port after a series of battles  japan then laid siege to the main russian base  and managed to take it before a relief fleet could arrive then russia and japan negotiated a peace treaty  this was basically the same japanese plan  surprise attacks  cripple the us pacific fleet  then take their main base  in the philippines  before the us could mount a relief effort it worked once  and worked again  up to a point however  russia caved because it was much weaker and the people were agitating for a revolution against the tsar the us had a much different reaction  and an industrial base that would not collapse under the strain of war  like imperial russia   but would produce massive amounts of arms and ships ,d02s3ld,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455679501.0,AgoraiosBum,1.0,0.0,85,23856,1.0

there s two different but related genres here  giant robot  aka super robot  and real robot  aka mecha   giant robot titles came first  i believe tetsujin28 was the first  or the first notable one   and gundam heralded the real robot genre  i ll address giant robots first this genre was created in the 1950s postwar japan had suffered defeat at the hands of a superior technology this was in the public mindset  and spawned quite a few scifi franchises godzilla  1954   for instance  was just a standin for what actually happened  an atomicpowered monstrosity attacked japan  and there was little they could do about it it captured the helplessness people felt  a natural response is   what if that power and technology could defend us instead of attack us   well  to appeal to people  a defender should nt be a scary monster it should nt be purely destructive like a bomb it should be more like a soldier  but  better  than a soldier incorruptable  more resilient than a human  more powerful  more advanced how can you make something like that  it would resemble a human  but be the product of technology  so  you get robots  the idea of which was just starting to be in vogue   astro boy  1952  was not a giant robot  but he was a humanoid robot he was the very idea of taking atomic power and taming it  turning it into a pure defender of justice instead of a threat to the nation  so you have two approaches at this point  atomic power is a big scary monster  and atomic power is an innocent human defender both ideas were extremely popular they were quickly combined in tetsujin28  1956   in which a giant powerful entity  is  a defender of justice and it s the result of technology  created by manthe public could believe that one day  they too could see such a thing come to pass that technology would not be their enemy  as in the atomic bomb   but their saviour and with japan  it really did work that way  the pursuit of technology turned the ruined nation into a world leader  and not through aggression  but the development of things people enjoyed  so that s how it started but as you d imagine  after a couple of decades of super robots saving the day against mustachetwirling villains  people would get bored japan had grown up  and they d actually developed a lot of technology it was good and useful and helped their economy  but it was nt an idealistic force for justice giant robots held appeal to kids  with a naive sense of good vs evil  but otherwise fell flat reality just was nt so perfect and cheerful  so this prompted the thought   what would it really be like if we developed a giant robot weapon   and the answer was illustrated in gundam  the first  real robot  show it was constrained by realism  these robots would nt have their own mind  but would simply be vehicles  this concept was already used for giant robots too  but it was  necessary  for a more realistic show  they could be used for good or bad  like any militarized technology they would be strong  but not invincible they would be powerful  but one alone could not save the world or a nation  gundam was known for being a series where characters could be killed off at any point  because that s what war was like gundam was a return to gritty realism for a new generation that never saw wwii  and find the idealistic escapism unrelatable  japan  also  was barred from having a real military but people are often interested in largescale conflict people like to imagine being a hero or defender  making sacrifices  etc these desires could not be expressed in a large military like japan used to have they were channeled instead into wild new scenarios  earth against space  a new future with a different political reality  a new chance to engage in war real robots were that answer they were the symbol of a future without restrictions  where people could imagine being war heroes again  but it was also a dark and gritty future full of loss and senseless conflict japan did nt forget those lessons  these two robot genres reflected the attitude of the country as a whole as it emerged from wwii and became what it is today  of course  once these huge series were cultural staples  they simply became part of japan s identity themselves they stopped being reflections and became a core that was in turn reflected people did nt make super robot shows because the public needed invincible heroesthe public instead saw the invincible hero as an ideal to emulate and that public  in turn  was hungry for more so  super robots came backfueled not by technology  but passion passion for justice and upholding ideals real robots continuedthe signature devices of japanese science fiction  a tool to allow any story to be told without regard for japan s current politics  they are now inescapable they re like star wars why are there so many references to star wars in america  was it  that  good  or is it just that it was the right thing at the right time that became part of

this has to do with how video files are encoded and compressed by computers  because green is a really important color for our eyes to perceive brightness  our eyes are bad at picking up tiny color variations but are good at picking up variations in brightness it turns out  due to how our eyes work   brightness is best perceived in the green part of light  since brightness information is much more valuable to our eyes than color  all parts of the digital video production chain  from digital sensors  to digital video encoding   are all built in such a way that information coming from green light is given  extra  weight and  extra  amount of data thus it is often better preserved and better recovered after errors  compressed video is usually transformed from the red green and blue input  into a  very important  brightness channel  calculated predominantly from green  because that s how we see  and two less important values for color  which are then ruthlessly compressed  since our eyes are shit at discerning tiny changes in color   when the video is played back on your screen  the software needs to recombine the brightness channel and the two color channels so it does the opposite math from the transformation  brightness turns into  mostly  green  and the two color channels are then introduced back into the necessary changes to make things stand out as red green and blue  when video is green   it means the brightness information loaded mostly correctly  but something went wrong in loading the color data  to restore correct color balance ,d02ng72,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455672266.0,Zweifuss,0.0,0.0,977,1611,0.0

generally speaking  glass is non reactive  so there s no worry that part of the bottle will react with the beer inside and alter the flavor  this is why most chemistry glassware is  well  glass it can be depended on not to interact with the chemicals  aluminum will react with acidic substances  and could alter the flavor of what it contains if there is not a good quality coating inside the can to prevent a reaction from occurring  as mentioned by others  modern cans are usually more than adequate to not alter the beer they contain  so there s no reason not to use them for high quality beer just like soda  which is also typically pretty acidic ,d02kgxx,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455667699.0,Reese_Tora,1.0,0.0,2820,26150,0.0

sound is vibrations in the air  when you pour water into a container  you create waves in the water these waves push and pull against the air above them  causing the air to vibrate this vibration in the air bounces around the walls of the container  causing it to resonate  trapping a vibration inside a container like this  causing it to resonate  is the basic principle behind most musical instruments   as the container fills up  there s less air inside it to vibrate the sound waves bouncing back and forth between the walls have less distance to cover on each trip from wall to wall so they take less time between each bounce the frequency of the vibration goes up  which means that when your ears sense the vibration  they perceive a higher pitch ,d02075s,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455639482.0,AirborneRodent,8.0,0.0,54189,80783,1.0

there are two situations you could be referring to and the odds are if you re confused it s because you re conflating the two there are  punts  and  kickoffs    a  punt  is when the team with the ball is on it s fourth down  and rather than risk turning the ball over to the other team after their next play  they opt to punt it back to the other team instead the ball will end up back an additional 3040 yards  but it ll end up in the other team s possession the offensive team snaps the ball back to a guy standing behind the line  the punter    he catches the ball  drops is from chestheight  and then kicks it downfield   http  i880photobucketcomalbumsac6cmpainpuntgif   a  kickoff  is when the offensive team has just scored  either by touchdown or field goal  and now the ball goes to the other team they put the ball on a tee at the 35yard line  and a guy standing about 15 yards behind the ball  the kicker    takes a running start and kicks it as far as he can down the field   https  mediagiphycommedia5xtdarzcaams4luhyeigiphygif  why am i making this distinction  because  the rules of football differ depending on which play is being run   specifically they differ on what happens if nobody from the other team touches the ball during a punt or a kickoff if nobody touches the ball during a  punt   the ball eventually comes to a stop at that point the play is whistled  dead  and the ball s awarded to the receiving team at the spot the ball stopped moving  if nobody touches the ball during a  kickoff   the ball remains live in fact  if a member of the   kicking team   grabs the ball   subject to certain rules  that go beyond an eli5  then they get the ball  so a member of the receiving team really needs to grab the ball  so with that in mind  here are the decisions to be made    during a punt     punt into the end zone   if the punt goes very deep  like past the receiving team s ten yard line  then it s in real danger of going into the end zone if it does  then the receiving team is awarded the ball on the 20 yard line so the punt returner  the guy who s job it is to catch the punt  will often just let the ball drop amp  bounce  hoping it goes into the end zone and they can get the ball on the 20 without a fuss this is a good deal for the receiving team  if the ball would have been caught at the 5  and you offered them a guaranteed 15yard return with a guarantee of nothing bad  fumbles  injuries  etc  happening  they d sign up    punt fair caught   if the punt goes very   high    and it s in no danger of going into the end zone  then often it gets fair caught it s very high  so it hangs up there a while  giving the punting team plenty of time for their guys to get downfield right next to the returner and they re getting all set to line up and take the guy s head off to avoid this the punt returner waves his arms like he s flagging a passing car  and then catches the punt where it s going to first hit the ground the opposing team is nt allowed to touch him but he s not allowed to run with the ball since he probably would ve gotten obliterated the moment he caught the ball  and maybe something bad happens  fumble  injury  etc   this is nt a bad deal    punt allowed to bounce   sometimes the returner does nt have a good play to make  either a fair catch or a return  so instead he just stays out of the way and the punt bounces mostly it bounces forward  good for the punting team  but sometimes backwards it   is    after all  an oddly shaped ball eventually the ball stops moving and it is awarded to the receiving team at the spot it stops moving or  if the punting team touches it  it stops there at that spot    punt returned   sometimes the returner catches the ball and runs it back    during a kickoff     kickoff into the end zone   if the kickoff ends up in the end zone  the ball still needs to be fielded by the receiving team but once they do the returner can  take a knee  and the ball is advanced to the 20 yard line  just like a punt into the end zone    kickoff through the end zone   this is the exact same result  only no kneeldown because it s impossible to field the ball in the field of play    kickoff returned   this is the only realistic other outcome  during a kickoff there is no fair catch but that s mostly because the defenders have a much longer way to run to get to the guy catching the ball during kickoffs  so there s less need to protect the guy and they never let the kickoff bounce  or if they do  they pick it up asap  because a kickoff is fair game for either team ,d02fjrm,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455660286.0,garrettj100,9.0,0.0,112,5826,0.0
it depends on the situation on the field if they let it fall there is zero chance for a fumble and the returning team gets the ball if they wave for a fair catch they can not be tackled and have to take a knee but if they drop the catch it is a fumble catching and running gives the best chance to get farther down the field but is the most risky if the opposing team is close to the punt returner ,d029tt9,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455652693.0,enigmasolver,5.0,0.0,112,5049,0.0
they ll run it if they think they can gain ground  if they do nt think they ll gain any ground  they ll call a  fair catch  by signaling with thier arm  this is basically saying  do nt tackle me i m not going to run the ball anywhere we agree to start here  taking a knee is for when there s a turnover  and the ball is kicked into  and caught in the endzone  the person takes a knee it s kind of like a  fair catch   only they ll start on thier 20 yard line they ll do this if they think they wo nt be able to get past the 20 yard line if they run it ,d029o3c,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455652482.0,56Subject,5.0,0.0,8,11555,0.0
it s strategy if you catch it and run  you are running the risk that you might fumble the ball to the other team  or that you will get tackled before the 20 yard line if you catch it and take a knee  or let it fall behind the endzone  you automatically start at the 20 yard line ,d029mwq,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455652438.0,Compromissionary,1.0,0.0,11,15353,0.0
for kickoffs  if they knee it in the endzone they start on the 20 yard line so it is usually a judgement of whether they think they will make it past the 20  maybe depending how far the kick is or how long it has hung in the air  for a punt  it is different because ounts are usually higher and shorter  there is a good chance the defense will be in your face by the time you catch it if you try and catch and fumble  they can take the ball  it must hit someone on the receiver s team   so in this case the judgement is  can i safely catch this and start running  or am i about to get hit and it is better to call a fair catch  ie you ca nt hit me  but i also ca nt run fair catch then is safer than letting it bounce  because it will probably  though not always  bounce further down field ,d02ae61,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455653448.0,bullevard,1.0,0.0,1,6716,1.0
the goal is to get the most yards possible by the receiving team by default  taking a knee   they get 20 yards letting it fall is the same as taking a knee  assuming it will bounce out of bounds   if they think the can make it farther than 20 yards then they run ,d02bu5w,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455655338.0,rafferty85,1.0,0.0,1,8763,0.0
because the ball is an oblong shape  and on a kick it is tumbling end over end  it is very difficult to catch securely also on a kick you have guys coming in at you at full speed  as opposed to a normal play where they would be coming at you much more slowly because of these two facts  if a defender is able to time it so that he can hit you within a second of you touching the ball  there is almost no way you will be able to hold onto it  which means it will probably be a turnover and a score for the other team that is why quite often a player will call for a fair catch on a punt  as for letting it bounce  the most common reason for this is because if it bounced into the endzone  you get the ball at the 20 yard line if you were to instead catch it inside the five  you probably wo nt be able to advance very far if at all  so the 20 is much better  so the player has to make a judgement call of whether or not it will reach the endzone  and then there is taking a knee this only occurs on kickoffs  as opposed to punts   one a kickoff  when you catch it in the endzone you have the option of either taking a knee and having the ball at the 20  or you can try to make it as far as you can hoping to get beyond the 20 on a kickoff it is much more reasonable to hope to get farther than the 20 than it would be on a punt because the opposing team is usually much farther away and you have more blockers still though it is a judgement call by the receiver  depending on how long the ball was in the air and how far back in the endzone it is ,d02co3p,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656444.0,bjb406,1.0,0.0,465,8453,0.0
if the ball hits the end zone or go past it  the receiving team automatically start on their 20 yard line the receiver of the ball makes a quick judgement on the people rushing at him and based on his perception if he can get catch the ball and run it past the 20th yard line if he can and there are no dangers of defenders forcing a fumble he would go for it  if he predicts the defenders will get to him too quickly  he might wave his arms indicating to everyone that it is a  fair catch   which is an agreement that he would attempt to gain more yards other than where he catches the ball  and in return the defenders wouldnt try to tackle him  if he doesnt go for the fair catch and he miscalculated and the defenders are closer than antipated  he might take the knee as soon as he catches the ball to end the play so he doesnt chance getting injured or fumbling the ball away ,d02d0qn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656918.0,therealgillbates,1.0,0.0,1,23264,0.0

first  this is changing pretty quickly lots of good breweries are canning these days my own research indicates that the canning line is more expensive to buy but has lower operating costs than a bottling line  as to why  good  beer has historically come in bottles rather than cans  it s mainly consumer perception  bottles just had more perceived quality than cans did if you are trying to sell beer for  10six rather than  6  you have to make the consumer feel like it s worth it  cans probably got a bad rap because when you drink straight from the container  they can make the beer taste tinny also  early cans were not as good as current cans  with coatings on the inside that could flake off  leading to tinny flavor even if you drank from a glass  it s the same reason that people preferred green glass over amber for a while  because the european imports they saw were in green glass  they associated that with a higherquality beer  even though beer in green glass skunks more easily a similar calculation goes into choosing pryoff caps over twistoffs  twistoffs are associated with cheap beer  so all the  good  breweries use pryoffs to differentiate their product ,d02g7gx,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455661208.0,NoLongerBetweenDogs,7.0,0.0,1,293,0.0
they do nt necessarily there is a general trend towards canning these days in the brewing industry a big factor is cost  an even bigger factor is minimizing things that can make the beer go bad bottling these days is almost exclusively done through counter pressure filling  the bottle is pressurized while filling   this was expensive and hard to do with cans nowadays there are systems that can do it  but most breweries would have open can filling and a seamer which crimps the lid on there is a high risk of oxygen pickup producing cans this way also  there seems to be a general consensus that bottles are  classier   so a nicer beer would inevitably be bottled the light issue is really only evident in clear  or green bottles ,d02g434,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455661078.0,TheCaptainsDizzler,1.0,0.0,26,18300,0.0
cans protect beer from light better than bottles because they are more opaque cans are made of metal  which are more chemically reactive than glass  so bottles protect beer from some chemical reactions better than cans which results in better tasting beer is up for debate i forget the brand  but there was one beer that advertised it had cans with glass  or glasslike  liners to get the best of both worlds ,d02jsy2,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455666630.0,troycheek,1.0,0.0,28,9971,0.0
generally speaking  glass is non reactive  so there s no worry that part of the bottle will react with the beer inside and alter the flavor  this is why most chemistry glassware is  well  glass it can be depended on not to interact with the chemicals  aluminum will react with acidic substances  and could alter the flavor of what it contains if there is not a good quality coating inside the can to prevent a reaction from occurring  as mentioned by others  modern cans are usually more than adequate to not alter the beer they contain  so there s no reason not to use them for high quality beer just like soda  which is also typically pretty acidic ,d02kgxx,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455667699.0,Reese_Tora,1.0,0.0,2820,26150,0.0

there are a lot of reasons people faint  if you get hit hard enough  your brain may knock against the inside your skull and may shut down as a defense mechanism  you may have low blood pressure  which will caused oxygen supply to lower to the brain your brain responds by shutting down  you may be hyperventiliating  which also interferes with oxygen to the brain  what your brain does  is basically knocks you out so that you will become horizontal this will make it easier for your heart to pump oxygen to the brain fainting is  in this respect  a survival reflex  as for what it s like  it sucks i get vasovagal syncope from time to time  though now i know what triggers it  anxiety attacks  and how to combat them directly so it does nt happen anymore  i have no perception of the passing out  when i wake up  it s like everything is fuzzy and slow and really far away i am totally disoriented   to share an embarassing story  the first time it happened to me  i was on the toilet i was going through some weight loss  and had overdone it at the gym for a week and did nt eat enough i was at like 1800 calories and really should have been eating more like 2800 or more  so  on the toilet got dizzy got a stomache ache woke up totally freaking out and thinking i was gon na die  horrible  but  i saw a doctor  it happened again  and we talked about what was going on and how to prevent it ,d01ntei,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455605704.0,StumbleOn,35.0,0.0,25,67199,0.0

syncope or feinting is essentially when you lose consciousness as a result of low blood pressure to the brain there are quite a few reasons as to what can trigger a feinting spell but the most common type is called vasovagal syncope  the symptoms are usually a sense of feeling lightheaded  feeling like you are about to throw up and a general loss of visual acuity  grey vision  tunnel vision  before ultimately blacking outloss of muscle control  medically there is nothing preventing someone from dreaming but its not a guaranteed thingat least no more than having or remembering a dream when you fall asleep naturally curiously though some patients have reported  hearing  or at least being aware of conversations while unconscious ,d01o551,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455606619.0,Rawsharkbones,3.0,0.0,1,119,0.0

the impetus for the pearl harbor attack was the us placing an oil embargo on japan  which pretty much  any  country 100  dependent on foreign sources for oil would consider an act of war  by attacking pearl harbor  they hoped to eliminate  or at least cripple the us pacific fleet naval combat was still a major  deciding force in those days they might not have actually thought they could invade the us and win  although the  did  manage to invade and hold one of the aleutian islands for a couple monthshardly the mainland   but they certainly hoped they could pull america s teeth in the pacific  but the raid was botched disastrously not only were all the allimportant aircraft carriers out to sea and thus spared  but even the bombing that did occur was not that effective only three ships were damaged beyond repair  perhaps even worse  the japanese attackers also failed to bomb the oil storage tanks near pearl harbor they knew about them  but had bought into the myth that america was awash in oil  and they felt it would be pointless in reality  those tanks represented pretty much all the oil for the pacific fleet  and if they d destroyed them  the fleet would have been essentially cut off from operating very far into the pacific for up to a year ,d02n3up,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455671753.0,DrColdReality,6.0,0.0,1,53378,1.0
just to add to the already great explanations  the japanese also believed if their attack went according to plan  it would take years for the us navy to be rebuilt to the same strength  turns out  they were able to rebuild in the matter of months  also  their plan included that they would have been able to destroy the aircraft carriers in the harbor fortunately they were out at sea during the attack,d02ns59,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455672759.0,Amongg,6.0,0.0,125,1644,0.0
so my understanding is that japan needed oil to get oil they needed to take some of the islands around indonesia to do this they needed to eliminate the americans in the philippines rather than a straight up fight they went with a surprise attack it worked they crippled our force  and were able to defeat us in the philippines and eventually take pretty much the entire pacific  so how did the us win  well  no one knew how effective aircraft carriers would be  and the american carriers survived pearl harbor also  pearl harbor was fairly shallow some of the ships could nt be salvaged  but a lot of the ships were salvaged no one really understood just how effective america could be at producing things the pocket battleship comes to mind also  the us was able to close the technological gap with the japanese zero  finally  war is an interesting concept the us was unwilling to except anything less than unconditional surrender when everything was going well for the japanese  before the battle of midway  they probably would have taken much worse terms if the us had sued for peace probably just guam and the philippines of course i am just speculating here that is the thing about war not all wars are fought to annihilate your enemy japan really wanted to fight the us briefly and win mild territorial gains i have heard a strong case that the yom kippur war was really about the arabs trying to get a better deal when they sued for peace than they had after the six days war it worked you do not always have to win a war to win a war ,d02psyn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455675847.0,Black__Hand,5.0,0.0,1,1004,0.0

japan s ultimate goal was to create its own sphere of influence in asia no  the japanese leadership did not believe they could win against america in a long war of attrition  which the war ended up being   but  the thinking was that by striking quickly at pearl harbour  japan could cripple the american fleet and allow japan to control asia unopposed then  after a few more victories  america would sign a peace deal allowing japan to keep the gains keep in mind  most of asia at this time was colonized by the european and american powers so  these strategic resources  such as rubber and oil  were going to europe and america instead of japan furthermore  obtaining these resources from russia was out of the question the russian army firmly defeated japan at the battle of  khalkhin gol   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattles_of_khalkhin_gol  which was a border skirmish by japan to test the russian military s strength so  japan s plan was now to expand southwards  tl  dr by eliminating the american navy  japan felt that it could achieve a quick victory and then sign a peace treaty ,d02oi2t,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455673848.0,DanALurker,1.0,0.0,965,188,0.0

there are two situations you could be referring to and the odds are if you re confused it s because you re conflating the two there are  punts  and  kickoffs    a  punt  is when the team with the ball is on it s fourth down  and rather than risk turning the ball over to the other team after their next play  they opt to punt it back to the other team instead the ball will end up back an additional 3040 yards  but it ll end up in the other team s possession the offensive team snaps the ball back to a guy standing behind the line  the punter    he catches the ball  drops is from chestheight  and then kicks it downfield   http  i880photobucketcomalbumsac6cmpainpuntgif   a  kickoff  is when the offensive team has just scored  either by touchdown or field goal  and now the ball goes to the other team they put the ball on a tee at the 35yard line  and a guy standing about 15 yards behind the ball  the kicker    takes a running start and kicks it as far as he can down the field   https  mediagiphycommedia5xtdarzcaams4luhyeigiphygif  why am i making this distinction  because  the rules of football differ depending on which play is being run   specifically they differ on what happens if nobody from the other team touches the ball during a punt or a kickoff if nobody touches the ball during a  punt   the ball eventually comes to a stop at that point the play is whistled  dead  and the ball s awarded to the receiving team at the spot the ball stopped moving  if nobody touches the ball during a  kickoff   the ball remains live in fact  if a member of the   kicking team   grabs the ball   subject to certain rules  that go beyond an eli5  then they get the ball  so a member of the receiving team really needs to grab the ball  so with that in mind  here are the decisions to be made    during a punt     punt into the end zone   if the punt goes very deep  like past the receiving team s ten yard line  then it s in real danger of going into the end zone if it does  then the receiving team is awarded the ball on the 20 yard line so the punt returner  the guy who s job it is to catch the punt  will often just let the ball drop amp  bounce  hoping it goes into the end zone and they can get the ball on the 20 without a fuss this is a good deal for the receiving team  if the ball would have been caught at the 5  and you offered them a guaranteed 15yard return with a guarantee of nothing bad  fumbles  injuries  etc  happening  they d sign up    punt fair caught   if the punt goes very   high    and it s in no danger of going into the end zone  then often it gets fair caught it s very high  so it hangs up there a while  giving the punting team plenty of time for their guys to get downfield right next to the returner and they re getting all set to line up and take the guy s head off to avoid this the punt returner waves his arms like he s flagging a passing car  and then catches the punt where it s going to first hit the ground the opposing team is nt allowed to touch him but he s not allowed to run with the ball since he probably would ve gotten obliterated the moment he caught the ball  and maybe something bad happens  fumble  injury  etc   this is nt a bad deal    punt allowed to bounce   sometimes the returner does nt have a good play to make  either a fair catch or a return  so instead he just stays out of the way and the punt bounces mostly it bounces forward  good for the punting team  but sometimes backwards it   is    after all  an oddly shaped ball eventually the ball stops moving and it is awarded to the receiving team at the spot it stops moving or  if the punting team touches it  it stops there at that spot    punt returned   sometimes the returner catches the ball and runs it back    during a kickoff     kickoff into the end zone   if the kickoff ends up in the end zone  the ball still needs to be fielded by the receiving team but once they do the returner can  take a knee  and the ball is advanced to the 20 yard line  just like a punt into the end zone    kickoff through the end zone   this is the exact same result  only no kneeldown because it s impossible to field the ball in the field of play    kickoff returned   this is the only realistic other outcome  during a kickoff there is no fair catch but that s mostly because the defenders have a much longer way to run to get to the guy catching the ball during kickoffs  so there s less need to protect the guy and they never let the kickoff bounce  or if they do  they pick it up asap  because a kickoff is fair game for either team ,d02fjrm,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455660286.0,garrettj100,9.0,0.0,112,5826,0.0
it depends on the situation on the field if they let it fall there is zero chance for a fumble and the returning team gets the ball if they wave for a fair catch they can not be tackled and have to take a knee but if they drop the catch it is a fumble catching and running gives the best chance to get farther down the field but is the most risky if the opposing team is close to the punt returner ,d029tt9,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455652693.0,enigmasolver,5.0,0.0,112,5049,0.0

it s strategy if you catch it and run  you are running the risk that you might fumble the ball to the other team  or that you will get tackled before the 20 yard line if you catch it and take a knee  or let it fall behind the endzone  you automatically start at the 20 yard line ,d029mwq,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455652438.0,Compromissionary,1.0,0.0,11,15353,0.0
for kickoffs  if they knee it in the endzone they start on the 20 yard line so it is usually a judgement of whether they think they will make it past the 20  maybe depending how far the kick is or how long it has hung in the air  for a punt  it is different because ounts are usually higher and shorter  there is a good chance the defense will be in your face by the time you catch it if you try and catch and fumble  they can take the ball  it must hit someone on the receiver s team   so in this case the judgement is  can i safely catch this and start running  or am i about to get hit and it is better to call a fair catch  ie you ca nt hit me  but i also ca nt run fair catch then is safer than letting it bounce  because it will probably  though not always  bounce further down field ,d02ae61,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455653448.0,bullevard,1.0,0.0,1,6716,1.0
the goal is to get the most yards possible by the receiving team by default  taking a knee   they get 20 yards letting it fall is the same as taking a knee  assuming it will bounce out of bounds   if they think the can make it farther than 20 yards then they run ,d02bu5w,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455655338.0,rafferty85,1.0,0.0,1,8763,0.0
because the ball is an oblong shape  and on a kick it is tumbling end over end  it is very difficult to catch securely also on a kick you have guys coming in at you at full speed  as opposed to a normal play where they would be coming at you much more slowly because of these two facts  if a defender is able to time it so that he can hit you within a second of you touching the ball  there is almost no way you will be able to hold onto it  which means it will probably be a turnover and a score for the other team that is why quite often a player will call for a fair catch on a punt  as for letting it bounce  the most common reason for this is because if it bounced into the endzone  you get the ball at the 20 yard line if you were to instead catch it inside the five  you probably wo nt be able to advance very far if at all  so the 20 is much better  so the player has to make a judgement call of whether or not it will reach the endzone  and then there is taking a knee this only occurs on kickoffs  as opposed to punts   one a kickoff  when you catch it in the endzone you have the option of either taking a knee and having the ball at the 20  or you can try to make it as far as you can hoping to get beyond the 20 on a kickoff it is much more reasonable to hope to get farther than the 20 than it would be on a punt because the opposing team is usually much farther away and you have more blockers still though it is a judgement call by the receiver  depending on how long the ball was in the air and how far back in the endzone it is ,d02co3p,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656444.0,bjb406,1.0,0.0,465,8453,0.0
if the ball hits the end zone or go past it  the receiving team automatically start on their 20 yard line the receiver of the ball makes a quick judgement on the people rushing at him and based on his perception if he can get catch the ball and run it past the 20th yard line if he can and there are no dangers of defenders forcing a fumble he would go for it  if he predicts the defenders will get to him too quickly  he might wave his arms indicating to everyone that it is a  fair catch   which is an agreement that he would attempt to gain more yards other than where he catches the ball  and in return the defenders wouldnt try to tackle him  if he doesnt go for the fair catch and he miscalculated and the defenders are closer than antipated  he might take the knee as soon as he catches the ball to end the play so he doesnt chance getting injured or fumbling the ball away ,d02d0qn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455656918.0,therealgillbates,1.0,0.0,1,23264,0.0

planes in the air are still affected by gravity in order for them to stay off the ground  a force has to be applied in the opposite direction of gravity  aka lift   now planes can get lift two ways the common way is using wings as air moves over the wings  the shape pushes most of it down increasing pressure under the wing and decreasing it above you can experience this yourself by sticking your hand out of a car window the second way in some jet powered aircraft  the force of the engine is enough to lift the plane without using wings this works the same way as letting go of the end of a balloon both of these are contingent on having enough air to either power the jet engine  or provide lift under the wings as planes fly higher  the air gets thinner until it is not enough to power the engines or provide enough lift under the wings to get to space  you need a rocket that brings its own air with it to power its engines,d02tylj,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455682679.0,Master-Potato,1.0,0.0,114,16146,0.0

back in the day  only the nobility was educated kings and dukes would pay scholars to live in their castles and share knowledge with their kids  and those scholars would take on apprentices and teach them  typically from the clergy  as the nobility expanded  someone came up with this neat idea called a university basically a boarding school  you d send your kids off there until you felt like having them back  often late into life part finishing school  part general studies  part daycare for princes  these places were pretty popular  helping nobles to stay ahead of the curve on technology and history rulers need to know about literally everything  so literally everything a ruler might need to know was taught  at the same time  churches started to provide basic schooling for commoners  no more than a primary education  it was still helpful to have farmers that could read state proclamations or the bible  and who could do some quick math to guess how many eggs they had to sell or how much wheat  in order to make more schools  they needed more and more teachers  who would up getting to go study with nobles in universities if they were bright enough to become university teachers by the mid 20th century  university became a way for the best and brightest to go meet the wealthy and powerful  gaining tremendous opportunity  then  in the 80s  people started to get this idea that university was the key to a better life for everyone we all wanted to go  instead of just the idle rich and the scholarship geniuses we started to borrow money to go  but fundamentally  university is still what it always was  a place for the idle rich to learn a little of everything so that they could have intelligent conversations with their advisers and ministers  so  basically  a better question is  why in the heck do they teach 3d animation in a university  that should be a trades course in a technical college  and should not have electives ,d0197gl,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455579988.0,alexander1701,6.0,0.0,314,73470,1.0

the university has its roots in religious institutions where it was believed that all proper schools of thought pointed to god  to have a better understanding of god you need a better understanding of math  science  and philosophy the ideal goal of education was to create a better believer  obviously modern university s are nt religious but the rise of liberalism and secularism did nt really challenge this conception of education it was still believed that a well rounded education might result in creating better people better capable of finding truth theology was nt the endallbeall  in general it seems we saw the universities move towards philosophy as the pinnacle of education though the sciences definitely hold that distinction today  through all of this  it s important to understand that  in the tradition of greek thinkers  philosophy and math and science often intersected a university wanted to create good philosophers or capable teachers of philosophy to be good at this you needed other skills  today  university is conceived as a better technical school but it s roots are more concerned with trying to shape the youth that attend into a specific sort of thinker one that is wellrounded yet specialized the first schools universities wanted to make better christians  postreformation they wanted to make better liberals for both a wellrounded education was deemed the way to do it ,d01wfzd,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455633285.0,piddlystains,1.0,0.0,1,15106,0.0

whenever i hear a university or faculty member say the reason for required gen ed is to make you  well rounded   i die a little on the inside politics has unfortunately become very interwoven with the administration of our educational institutions everywhere  particularly in public universities since funding is tied to a government and thus  politics this is not to say that politics are all bad  but there certainly is some weight behind the arguments trying to separate education from it i do nt really agree with those saying gen ed is to milk money universities do not make much money off of students the bulk of the money comes from donorsalumni and research  which is carried out usually at the graduate level and above  and also by established professionals who are said to be professors but you never see them because they do not teach or they rarely teach  you say you want to major in animation  and i wanted to respond because i am currently majoring in that field myself  it is very exciting and fun  you will love it so long as you work diligently  develop a thick skin to critiques  and strive to always express yourself in every project even if the teacher wants to suppress your voice  they are out there unfortunately   so  i say  specifically to you  soontobeanimator  gen ed will be good for you as a part of the artistdesigner field of specialties  animators draw from everything around them we are inspired by everything  i took a class called  insects and human disease  to fulfill a science credit and now i am taking a stellar astronomy class they both have inspired me greatly in my ideas some of my projects which required creations of patterns  i used the shape classifications of bacteria as a basic motif  for instance you never know where you will suddenly find inspiration and  as an animator  if you find yourself animating humans or animals  which you will  you re going to want to know what s going on inside them  for instance you will want to know basic newtonian physics to understand more intuitively how objects will collide or bendsnap  or how hair will flow  but there are computer programs to stimulate that   is a true and valid argument but intuition is invaluable  and though it pains me to say it  math is surprisingly helpful in the design world and history  and yes  you will need to know how to formulate and present both in writing and speech your ideas  arguments  thoughts  and justifications for your final projects so english is going to be a boon for you there too  as animatorsdesignersartists it is good to have a solid breadth of knowledge to draw from i firmly believe this applies to every other major ,d02e7sn,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455658517.0,foxwaffles,1.0,0.0,1,55,0.0

there s actually a very interesting physical principle behind thisit s called the the square cube law when size of something doubles  the surface area quadruples  2 squared  and the mass octuples is multiplied by eight  2 cubed   the reason is because surface area is 2 dimensional and volume  upon which mass depends  is three dimensional the area of a square is l x w double the size of the square  and you get 2l x 2w separate out the 2s and you get 2x2xlxw  or 2 squared times the surface area you had before you doubled it s size now for volume  you have l x w x h  so double that and you get 2lx2wx2h  2x2x2xlxwxh or 2 cubed times the previous volume thus the law it s called the square cube law rather than the four eight law or something because this principle holds for any multiplier triple the size  the surface area becomes 9 times larger  3 squared   and the mass becomes 27 times larger  3 cubed   now  strength of materials is proportional to the cross section  so let s look at a leg bone as an example cut a leg bone in the middle and you ll see how thick it is  the cross section this cross section is proportional to the surface area  double the size of the leg  the cross sectional area quadruples but the mass that leg must support is eight times heavier  so say you have a leg that can carry 20lbs of weight but the creature it s attached to only puts 10lbs of weight on it supposing it has four such legs  the creature can therefore carry 40 extra pounds  or 4x its body weight the weight carrying ability of the leg is once again proportional to the cross section and thus the surface area double it s size  the leg can now carry 80 lbs because it quadrupled but the mass it must carry is now 80lbs  still just fine because there are four legs  the creature can now carry 240lbs extra seems like an improvement  right  but it s not  really  when you compare that to the body weight the creature can now only carry 3x it s body weight instead of the previous 4x  and that keeps diminishing the larger the creature gets  now  i used weight carrying ability because it s more intuitive  but the same principle applies to any other force you apply to the creature from any direction a flick technically counts as an impulse  i believe  which makes the math a little messier  but it s the same principle at work a smaller creature can resist larger accelerationsforcesimpulses compared to its body weight because it has proportionally less mass compared to its structural and muscular strength  edit  i screwed up the example a bit if the creature puts 10lbs of its bodyweight on each leg  it would weigh 40 pounds total  and could carry it s bodyweight extra double the size  and it would barely be able to carry it s own body weight and could carry no extra ,d021hng,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455641335.0,silverskull39,264.0,0.0,384,62122,0.0
