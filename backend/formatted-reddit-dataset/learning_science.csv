gt  for every hour later a test was held  scores declined by 09 percenta 20 or 30 minute break before an exam saw an average improvement of 17 percent in test scores the conclusion seems wrong to me so if you have a exam later but with a break prior then the results are better is it likely the decline is due to students sitting more than one exam or being exhausted by other mental work prior to the exam that is causing the decline and not the start time itself so exam results have nothing to do with start time and more to do with having a rested mind ,d01u49c,science,learning,1455628063.0,_durian_,2.0,0.0,1,15678,0.0

this provides more evidence that you should eat high quality food  not just the cheapest type sold  in this study the problems result from contaminants and toxins in the fish  not the from eating fish in general this is why wildcaught salmon are so nutritionally different from farmed fish you could cross reference this study with studies that show how environmental toxin exposures causes rapid weight gain  relevant quote   contamination by environmental pollutants in fish could provide an explanation for the observed association between high fish intake in pregnancy and increased childhood adiposity  ,d02cs5f,science,learning,1455656596.0,DarrenRM,3.0,0.0,142,323,0.0

translating the equations for gravity from describing curved spacetime  to describing a separate parameter for the equations of gravitational time dilation  straumann  s calculations showed that an algebraic equation  eq  2    was a very accurate representation of gravitational experiment  when applied to solar system and even using binary pulsar data  6   thus by using these principles it has

hole systems  as will be shown here  in very high density objects such as black holes these equations also give very accurate results for time dilation in doing so  they also avoid the formation of black hole singularities here  we develop these equations for gravitational time dilation in the vicinity of a black hole this again gives answers that are technically in exact agreement with observations  the principal difference in dynamic gravitation  enters the equations in the very high mass density scale in objects such as black holes  conventionally these form an infinitely dense singularity  and classically there is infinite time dilation at the event horizon  4  5   the advantage of this new approach is that we can resolve the concept of singularities and infinite time dilation it is possible to use the dynamic advanced equations  and importantly these agree with current observation of black holes  for the event horizon  t  rs  rs  2gm  c2  7  and as t   t0  1  gmrs

i applaud your efforts at transparency it s a sign of good management well done  i hope you will take thorough and active consideration of the resulting feedback  i ve never been banned nor silenced in a subreddit  so what i have to say does nt come from personal interest     your audience may find the number of bans more significant than you do   the opening of your report states the aim of disspelling the perception that rscience is ban happy later in the report  it says  we only banned 126 users this month  the word  only  concerns me only 126 users a month  every month  tots up to more than 1500 users banned a year statistically  that may be an insignificant fraction of your users communitywise  you re banning a townful of people each year     how does your list of banned phrases relate to your community s standards    many of the banned phrases mentioned in your report are part of the everyday reddit vernacular it s not likely that your typical redditor would be offended by them in general conversation     banning without a warning and reasonable grounds is unethical   call it ethics  natural justice  procedural fairness  what you will the point is  if you re going to act to someone s detriment  you need to present them with the evidence of what they ve done and ask for their side of the matter before you make a decision  or you ll have acted unjustly now  if you ve posted a clear warning  eg the warning that appears under the comments pane when a user clicks the reply link  and a user ignores that  it would be ethical to act as long as you state reasonable grounds eg what warning they ignored banning a person without notifying them of reasonable grounds is never justified it s good that your report admits fault in that area and identifies it as an area to work on it s ethically necessary that you follow that up     your rules may need to be posted more clearly   if  as the report suggests  you re responding to modmail more than 100 times a month to inform people that reposts and posts without flair will be removed  you might be able to cut down your workload as well as reduce your users  frustration by showing those criteria in big letters above the content pane of your link submission form i ve seen that approach used to good effect in other subreddits  edit  a little clarification ,czi6vyf,science,learning,1454208278.0,Falstaffe,17.0,0.0,4155,66990,0.0

who ever wrote this article has   no idea   how electronics work the claims about even conventional transistors or basic conduction are so terribly wrong that it makes me mad  let me start my more in depth response by saying the people at university of utah probably know what they are doing  though 3 yeas sounds like a long time for a proof of concept prototype  it is possible they mean a marketable design or something like that   but the interviewer is lacking on understanding  ok the first point is on basic conduction  here is a quote rom the article gt   sno allows  electrical charges to move through it much faster than conventional 3d materials such as silicon electrons generally move pretty slowly  you could out walk them  in a wire and what not  but that does nt matter because the fields propagate at a  significant portion of the speed of light   https  enwikipediaorgwikispeed_of_electricity   speeding up electrons means basically nothing and probably is not what is actually happening  gt  and because the electrons move through one layer instead of bouncing around in a 3d material  there will be less friction  meaning the processors will not get as hot as normal computer chips  this is a bald faced lie  friction does not come in to it  and in fact the more crosssectional area for a given conductor the lower the resistance so a thicker wire will conduct better heat comes from power which comes from current  voltage or or more relevantly  the energy for a charging transistor output is  voltage of supply   2   capacitance of the output node  so a reduced capacitance at the  drain  would mean a cooler chip a 2d transistor would likely have pretty low capacitances which brings me to my next point gt  transistors made with tiwari s semiconducting material could lead to computers and smartphones that are more than 100 times faster than regular devices  since the rest of his reporting is so bad i have no idea if he is just making that number up or what but i will go over what makes a transistor fast  here   http  flylibcombooks41021html2images0130338575graphics05fig03gif  is a diagram of a simple cmos logic family inverter  put in a 1 get a 0 and vice versa   i am picking cmos because it is super nice but most logic works in basically the same way let s look at what happens when vin goes from gnd to vdd  0 to 1   initially  the pmos is conducting  though it has some resistance  which pulls the output up to vdd but as the input voltage drops the it turns in to an open switch and no longer conducts as this is happening the nmos begins to conduct  again with some resistance  which starts to pull the output down to gnd the speed at which the output discharges and reaches a useable value for the next logic gate to start working is proportional to the  the capacitance at the output    current through the currently conducting transistor   so a lower capacitance at the output is faster  note that there is not an actual capacitor here just the inherent capacitance of the transistors and whatever the output is driving   the other way to increase speed is to increase current which can be done by increasing vdd  which will increase the power and heat  see  voltage of supply  above  or reducing the resistance of the conducting transistor  which usually increases size of the transistors  see  crosssectional area  above   edit  added specifics,d01feqx,science,learning,1455589839.0,LessConspicuous,8.0,0.0,15,3063,0.0

there s probably a lot of truth to it  if the goal of dominance is to get what you want  then it is one path in getting what you want let s take the research for what it is and say that people are more comfortable with male dominance  the other way to get what you want is to seek compassion  manipulate  act cute i d venture to say people are more comfortable with female using these  what is interesting about this research is that the implicit forms of dominance do not affect likability or hireability we might not be inherently turned off by dominance by woman in our lizard brain we might not be inherently turned off by weakness in men in our lizard brain  i d go out on a limb here and suggest that the reason we might get sexist results  for both men and women  when they seek to get what they want by feminine and masculine ways respectively  is due it appearing a contradiction  for example  if a man tries to be cuteweakmanipulate in order to get what they want  can people sense a conflict there if it is fake  if he is actually quite capable so they are repulsed by it  or if a woman tries to be dominance  but also shows weaknessmanipulates then are you going to be repulsed by her dominance  some powerful woman  can create an aura of repulsion if they display dominance and as i reflect on it  i think a lot of it has to do with them leaking a lot of weakness the primal part of people says  how can i be dominated by someone who leaks weakness whether it is her physical weakness  talking about being a victim  about how men oppress them or hold them back  if you look at it from a political perspective  were people turned off by margaret thatcher s dominance  i was nt around during that british era  but from i read  it does nt seem like it i think a big reason for it is her powerdominance did nt leak weakness she did nt complain about more powerful people stopping her she did nt complain about the glass ceiling  i think that s a real thing how can you demand subjugation through dominance  when you re constantly talking about how other people are more powerful that you or all the things that limit you  i think a lot of woman have real trouble with dominance as they ve been socialized their whole life to express their weaknesses and get help  the opposite is true of men  men have a lot of trouble with get sympathy because they ve been socialized their whole life to hide their weaknesses  the result is i think naturally that people are repulsed by the contradiction that often results people can cross that barrier  but it is harder ,czzofp5,science,learning,1455469128.0,scamper_22,21.0,0.0,1,6588,0.0

there s probably a lot of truth to it  if the goal of dominance is to get what you want  then it is one path in getting what you want let s take the research for what it is and say that people are more comfortable with male dominance  the other way to get what you want is to seek compassion  manipulate  act cute i d venture to say people are more comfortable with female using these  what is interesting about this research is that the implicit forms of dominance do not affect likability or hireability we might not be inherently turned off by dominance by woman in our lizard brain we might not be inherently turned off by weakness in men in our lizard brain  i d go out on a limb here and suggest that the reason we might get sexist results  for both men and women  when they seek to get what they want by feminine and masculine ways respectively  is due it appearing a contradiction  for example  if a man tries to be cuteweakmanipulate in order to get what they want  can people sense a conflict there if it is fake  if he is actually quite capable so they are repulsed by it  or if a woman tries to be dominance  but also shows weaknessmanipulates then are you going to be repulsed by her dominance  some powerful woman  can create an aura of repulsion if they display dominance and as i reflect on it  i think a lot of it has to do with them leaking a lot of weakness the primal part of people says  how can i be dominated by someone who leaks weakness whether it is her physical weakness  talking about being a victim  about how men oppress them or hold them back  if you look at it from a political perspective  were people turned off by margaret thatcher s dominance  i was nt around during that british era  but from i read  it does nt seem like it i think a big reason for it is her powerdominance did nt leak weakness she did nt complain about more powerful people stopping her she did nt complain about the glass ceiling  i think that s a real thing how can you demand subjugation through dominance  when you re constantly talking about how other people are more powerful that you or all the things that limit you  i think a lot of woman have real trouble with dominance as they ve been socialized their whole life to express their weaknesses and get help  the opposite is true of men  men have a lot of trouble with get sympathy because they ve been socialized their whole life to hide their weaknesses  the result is i think naturally that people are repulsed by the contradiction that often results people can cross that barrier  but it is harder ,czzofp5,science,learning,1455469128.0,scamper_22,21.0,0.0,1,6588,0.0

nonpsychologists often conceive of dominance as an overt display of power  in psychological research  dominance is conceptualized as power of influence the actual strategy one uses does not determine dominance rather  it is about how much one desires to manipulate others  and how successful they are at it  this can also be true of  dominant  behaviors as well  such as eye contact in principle  it is not about staring or looking away it is whether your doing that is expressing a desire to influence someone s behavior  and how successfully you are influencing them a false display of submission can be an incredibly powerful way of manipulating people  and thus becoming dominant over them this strategy has the additional benefit of making it appear as though the dominant person is not responsible  and thus held liable  for the other person s behavior ,czzmxjw,science,learning,1455466411.0,idkwtfhell,756.0,0.0,1101,996,1.0

translating the equations for gravity from describing curved spacetime  to describing a separate parameter for the equations of gravitational time dilation  straumann  s calculations showed that an algebraic equation  eq  2    was a very accurate representation of gravitational experiment  when applied to solar system and even using binary pulsar data  6   thus by using these principles it has

hole systems  as will be shown here  in very high density objects such as black holes these equations also give very accurate results for time dilation in doing so  they also avoid the formation of black hole singularities here  we develop these equations for gravitational time dilation in the vicinity of a black hole this again gives answers that are technically in exact agreement with observations  the principal difference in dynamic gravitation  enters the equations in the very high mass density scale in objects such as black holes  conventionally these form an infinitely dense singularity  and classically there is infinite time dilation at the event horizon  4  5   the advantage of this new approach is that we can resolve the concept of singularities and infinite time

editing and page composition it may differ from the final official version of record  11 in low and medium gravitational fields the results of current classical models and dynamic gravity presented here are technically exactly the same  see results 31   notably  in both gravitational models time dilation increase significantly as the radius of orbit approaches 10 schwarzschild radii or less at these distances the results still remain almost the same current classical gravity gives a time dilation factor of 105  compared to 1054 in dynamic advanced gravity at 10 rs however  in classical gravity time dilation increases exponentially as we approach the event horizon  and time stops at the event horizon with advanced gravity in the case where the event horizon has been reached at 1rs  time dilation due to gravity is equivalent to a factor of 15  eq  9    importantly  the presumed singularities that appeared in current gravity do not appear in these dynamic advanced equations  these observations are strongly corroborated by a reanalysis of recent observations from black holes these observations include emissions from the radius of innermost stable circular orbit  risco   12   and broadening of the iron k alpha line  13   from the observations of cygnus x 1  the results give an inner radius rin  112 rs  and xray fluorescence was shown to be predominantly confined to 10 rs  12   observations of cygnus x1 spectra and the iron k alpha line  gives a red shift 081 101 2  red    13   current classical gravity  eq  1    predicts an increase by a factor of 3055 in the gravitational red shift at the radius of 112 rs  with a red shift 191 2  red   thus  the results from classical gravity predict almost twice the observed values here we predict gravitation red shift by a factor of 1446  at 112 rs  with a red shift  1 013 2  red   in keeping with recent observations  13   importantly these equations allow further accurate tests of gravitation  particularly in the vicinity of black holes  page 11 of 14 can j phys downloaded from wwwnrcresearchpresscom by san diego  ucsd  on 122915 for personal use only this justin manuscript is the accepted manuscript prior to copy editing

we can formulate the equations in a way which technically agrees exactly with gravitational experiment this is particularly applies to the timing of gps systems here we also present the generic formulae for time dilation  which allow these equations to be used in instances including that of black hole gravitational systems here we further show  in extreme cases such as at the schwarzschild radius of black holes  these dynamic advanced equations can be applied to gravitational time dilation equation  9   indicates that time dilation at the schwarzschild radius  where time is slowed  is not infinitely slowed but slows by a factor of 15 thus  using this eq  9   in the dnag model the time dilation is not infinite  and does not result in a black hole singularity  in previous publications we have already calculated the advance in the perihelion of mercury and other planets and astronomical objects in the solar system  to a very high degree of accuracy  3   a reformulation of the equations shows that advanced gravitational equations are also very accurate for binary pulsars  using recent data for psr b 153412 from straumann  6  7   here  it has also been shown that theses equations are accurate for observations of cygnus x1  1214   these results suggest a straight line correlation between dynamic advanced gravitation  for low and medium mass and high density gravitational bodies  these dynamic advanced equations  can also help explain the apparent missing mass of the galaxy  due to the presence of  primordial  black holes in the galactic halo  1  2   and to the indirect effects that an increased force of gravity has on the galactic rotation curve dynamic advanced gravity can explain the presence of page 12 of 14 can j phys downloaded from

official version of record  13 dark matter at the galactic level because of an increase in gravity that is predicted  but goes beyond this in the prediction of observations from the bullet cluster  2  3   in this paper  it has been demonstrated that dynamic advanced gravity can also explain the physical phenomena of time dilation  and technically agrees accurately with gravitational experiment it explains the recent findings of increased gamma rays emanating from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy  15   by resolving infinite time dilation it also resolves the difficulties that arise from the formation of infinite density singularities overall  dynamic newtonian advanced gravity  dnag   de facto technically gives exactly the same answers as gravitational experiment  but it is also offers a solution to a number of contemporary gravitational anomalies  importantly it offers a number of verifiable predictions for gravity  particularly in the vicinity of black holes this could be achieved in accordance with the results of the generic equations for black hole as given in table 1 gravitational time dilation could either be measured the using the gravitational red shift of a strong em source in the vicinity of a black hole equally well a probe issuing a timed signal could be used significant differences between dnag and classical gravity would emerge at about 10

editing and page composition it may differ from the final official version of record  11 in low and medium gravitational fields the results of current classical models and dynamic gravity presented here are technically exactly the same  see results 31   notably  in both gravitational models time dilation increase significantly as the radius of orbit approaches 10 schwarzschild radii or less at these distances the results still remain almost the same current classical gravity gives a time dilation factor of 105  compared to 1054 in dynamic advanced gravity at 10 rs however  in classical gravity time dilation increases exponentially as we approach the event horizon  and time stops at the event horizon with advanced gravity in the case where the event horizon has been reached at 1rs  time dilation due to gravity is equivalent to a factor of 15  eq  9    importantly  the presumed singularities that appeared in current gravity do not appear in these dynamic advanced equations  these observations are strongly corroborated by a reanalysis of recent observations from black holes these observations include emissions from the radius of innermost stable circular orbit  risco   12   and broadening of the iron k alpha line  13   from the observations of cygnus x 1  the results give an inner radius rin  112 rs  and xray fluorescence was shown to be predominantly confined to 10 rs  12   observations of cygnus x1 spectra and the iron k alpha line  gives a red shift 081 101 2  red    13   current classical gravity  eq  1    predicts an increase by a factor of 3055 in the gravitational red shift at the radius of 112 rs  with a red shift 191 2  red   thus  the results from classical gravity predict almost twice the observed values here we predict gravitation red shift by a factor of 1446  at 112 rs  with a red shift  1 013 2  red   in keeping with recent observations  13   importantly these equations allow further accurate tests of gravitation  particularly in the vicinity of black holes  page 11 of 14 can j phys downloaded from wwwnrcresearchpresscom by san diego  ucsd  on 122915 for personal use only this justin manuscript is the accepted manuscript prior to copy editing and page composition it may differ from the final official version of record  12 3  conclusions and discussion the principal findings in this paper are  that using a dynamic reformulation of gravity  we can formulate the equations in a way which technically agrees exactly with gravitational experiment this is particularly applies to the timing of gps systems here we also present the generic formulae for time dilation  which allow these equations to be used in instances including that of black hole gravitational systems here we further show  in extreme cases such as at the schwarzschild radius of black holes  these dynamic advanced equations can be applied to gravitational time dilation equation  9   indicates that time dilation at the schwarzschild radius  where time is slowed  is not infinitely slowed but slows by a factor of 15 thus  using this eq  9   in the dnag model the time dilation is not infinite  and does not result in a black hole singularity  in previous publications we have already calculated the advance in the perihelion of mercury and other planets and astronomical objects in the solar system  to a very high degree of accuracy  3   a reformulation of the equations shows that advanced gravitational equations are also very accurate for binary pulsars  using recent data for psr b 153412 from straumann  6  7   here  it has also been shown that theses equations are accurate for observations of cygnus x1  1214   these results suggest a straight line correlation between dynamic advanced gravitation  for low and medium mass and high density gravitational bodies  these dynamic advanced equations  can also help explain the apparent missing mass of the galaxy  due to the presence of  primordial  black holes in the galactic halo  1  2   and to the indirect effects that an increased force of gravity has on the galactic rotation curve dynamic advanced gravity can explain the presence of page 12 of 14 can j phys downloaded from

official version of record  13 dark matter at the galactic level because of an increase in gravity that is predicted  but goes beyond this in the prediction of observations from the bullet cluster  2  3   in this paper  it has been demonstrated that dynamic advanced gravity can also explain the physical phenomena of time dilation  and technically agrees accurately with gravitational experiment it explains the recent findings of increased gamma rays emanating from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy  15   by resolving infinite time dilation it also resolves the difficulties that arise from the formation of infinite density singularities overall  dynamic newtonian advanced gravity  dnag   de facto technically gives exactly the same answers as gravitational experiment  but it is also offers a solution to a number of contemporary gravitational anomalies  importantly it offers a number of verifiable predictions for gravity  particularly in the vicinity of black holes this could be achieved in accordance with the results of the generic equations for black hole as given in table 1 gravitational time dilation could either be measured the using the gravitational red shift of a strong em source in the vicinity of a black hole equally well a probe issuing a timed signal could be used significant differences between dnag and classical gravity would emerge at about 10

hi do you think capitalism is sustainable in the long run  i m thinking that when at some point there are nt any jobs left  or very few  people will have no buying power which means no revenue for businesses we would have to completely rethink society  if people do nt have money they ca nt survive the idea of a monetary system would no longer make sense unless we simply give everybody money for doing nothing  i also believe that the people in power  ie the few  that are extremely rich  would fight very hard to keep capitalism going since it would sustain their wealth so basically we d run into a period where half the world population  or more  are starving due to lack of income while the rich refuse to remodel society  so all i m saying is  shit is going to hit the fan hard as in a major world war where everyone will be fighting for the resources that will still cost money but should nt  what are your thought on this ,czyg0pg,science,learning,1455372019.0,MyRoomAteMyRoomMate,38.0,0.0,738,5636,0.0

actually  i m a trucker  and encounter the  driverless rig  question a lot and a good deal of questions come up  like how long until they re here and we re out of jobs  i m not asking a question  more like informing you of the improbabilities of that happening on a total scale  most truckers  might  be out of a job think about a box truck driver  gcvw of 26001 or greater  less than 52000   that has to deliver small batches of goods to small businesses that ca nt afford or properly map out a route to their small business or otr flatbed drivers delivering goods to  i shit you not  dirt  rural roads in the middle of nowhere  only being provided rough directions to a farmhouse not yet erected or better yet  hauling hazardous materials  radioactive  combustible   heavy haul  mobile homes  extremely heavy parts for machines  oversized loads   and difficult to carry loads  the infrastructure changes necessary would be immense and would likely not be taken seriously i agree   certain  types of truckers could be replaced good example is places that distribute on routes  think small trucks under 26001  ltl trailers  or 26001 straight box trucks  from distribution centers to stores intrastate but we re talking strictly walmart no other routes could be planned for accordingly  and would still likely require a shotgun aboard to ensure route and safety but in a grand scale  all trucks can not be replaced not even an eighth of them could  think of this there s an empty roboflatbed truck  right  grossed at 80000pulls into a place to pick up  uh lumber well  the shipper could be an ass  and think  oh well  nobody s watching what s a few extra thousand pounds   and bam  there s an illegal rig rolling  more to the point  who has secured that load  did they use proper securement methods  equipment  and regulation  did they use enough  is it tarped  who s gon na take care of that load  who hands the receiver the bills  who ensures the load is the same shit being shipped  who makes sure some rolling roadblock does nt slow the rig to a halt  snag the load from the truck without incident  and absconds with potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of valuable materials  who will pretrip that truck every day to ensure it meets all highway  interstate  and federal safety requirements  who calls in for repairs  who fuels the rigs  who jockies the trailers for drop n hook  who pulls over when a piece of road debris gets thrown under an axel and shears the air lines  who will take responsibility when something bonks with the rig and it kills a family of six that blew a stop sign and got spread across a quarter mile of i225  what about if some teen punks throw a tv off a bridge and it smashes into the cabsensor array and it literally disables the rig  no  my friends i am behind replacing a small group of truckers dedicated  very specific routes  but even then  they ll need a shotgun rider or an escort but at the very least  someone will be on board  at all times it may be a slipseat shotgun  it may be otr shotgun  but someone  has to be on board  if there is any counterargument  i d love to hear it ,czz41d0,science,learning,1455416381.0,TechnoEquinox,2.0,0.0,1007,30172,0.0

hi everyone  there is a vast split between how technologists consider the impact of technology on labor and how economists consider the impact on technology do you think that  perhaps  economists may be better placed to understand the economic impacts of technology and that the focus falling on the wrong issues is going to lead to bad policy in addressing the real challenges technological change introduces  your introduction contained an example of one of these  gt  there are millions of people who make a living from driving like bus drivers and taxi drivers what kind of jobs are going to replace them  as an economist this topic is a huge pet peeve as technological unemployment is fundamentally fallacious  technology disrupts labor but does not displace labor  and technology is often complimentary to labor increasing productivity amp  labor demand there was a symposium devoted to this topic in a jep  last year   https  wwwaeaweborgarticlesphp  doi  101257jep293  but it does nt seem to have any impact on the continued claims of technological unemployment being imminent  to circle back to my original question as automation will introduce wage or income inequality concerns  which require largely an educational and transfer policy response  do you think the focus on something that wont occur  technological unemployment  is going to distract from good policy ,czynavz,science,learning,1455386508.0,he3-1,5.0,0.0,166,6384,0.0

i think the future has the potential for a heavenlike quality of life of course it all depends on how accepting we are of the changes that come with automation i feel as if the world will inevitably become socialized in most aspects everyone would get what they needed in terms of necessities and also not have to work a single day of their lives ever again if this were the case how would we go about distributing the goods and services would we just give people a certain amount of money that they could spend as they choose  also i think  the biggest issue would be that people could no longer differentiate themselves from others by working harder they would want to be  successful  but they would nt have anything to work towards i feel as if the only way the system could function in a way that makes everyone happy would be to have a way for people to  climb up the ladder  in order to achieve more luxurious goods and services when compared to some standard that everyone else lives off do you guys think my perception on the issue is correct  have you guys thought about what kind of work would be available to people who want to be  successful  in order to differentiate themselves from a standard and be able to receive more money  i can think of a few like occupations like computer scientists  arts people  or the owners of goods and services who would be available to receive more money because of the value of their contributions this sounds very silly but perhaps people could earn more money by generating electricity in their spare time  probably the most likely outcome will be that if people want to be successful they will have to contribute to society in a valuable way if you want more then basically you will have to get an education and be a programmer or a physicist or whatever i feel like this would be an era for major scientific breakthroughs since that would be the most valuable thing one last thoughtdo you guys think drug use would sky rocket  people would be bored out of their minds and would need something to distract themselves with do you think people will just do drugs and and play video games and party all day  i think so ,czykfs2,science,learning,1455381549.0,Pablo-Checon,3.0,0.0,1,33,0.0

you are going to find more and more studies describing the toxic  effects of glucose consumption goes on many people do nt know this  but sugars are used for a hell of akt more than just energy carbohydrates form the largest class of lost translational modifications and have been called the third language of life after dna and proteins glycosylation of proteins regulates everything from their half lives on the cell surface  where proteins are trafficked  how proteins fold  and even how proteins function for example  some ion channels have over 30  of their entire molecular weight in carbohydrates  and changing a single sugar on an ion channel in the brain can radically affect gating properties and yes  as time goes on  we recognize more and more that glycosylation patterns changes based on nutritional state  additionally there is a very very special type of glycosylation known as oglcnac which is the addition of a single sugar  glcnac  to intracellular proteins on serthr residues the function of oglcnac is many  but often times the same serthr residues that are glycsoylated by oglcnac are the same residues where proteins are phosphorylated in other words  oglcnac is like a master regulator of proteome functionality just like phosphorylation  but there are two things quite striking  1  oglcnac of the entire proteome is regulated by only 2 enzymes  ogt adds it  oga removes it  which is remarkably different than phosphorylation which requires hundreds if not thousands of different kinases and phosphatases  and 2  the substrate for the oglcnac modification  glcnac  is a direct product from glycolysis and primary glucose metabolism through what is known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway so what kinds of proteins are modified by oglcnac  well  we ve known for almost 30 years now that your chromatin is heavily glycsoylated and that it is from oglcnac decades later we ve found that oglcnac is found on histones  so it is part of the histone code and histone epgenetics   nearly every transcription factor is glycsoylated by oglcnac  that rna poly ii can not read your genes and bind to dna without being glycsoylated by oglcnac  and that all 3 humantet enzymes  which are involved in regulating dna methylation  are modified by oglnac if you see the big picture  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is sort of like an exquisite super computing biosensor developed by nature that can take environment  space  time  nutrition  etc and can alter glucose fluxes to regulate the amount of substrate that s available to perform the oglcnac modification oglcnac mechanics can then regulate everything from protein function to which genes are directly transcribed by rna poly ii to writing your epigenetics a lot of things go wrong during super fed high glucose states or when glucose metabolism is disturbed  for example  diabetes  cancer  and alzheimer s all have very well known glucose metabolism changes it really is nt surprising to learn more and more about how high feddiabetichigh sugar diets can affect the brain the connection between sugary diets and changes to genes proteins epigentics could very well be oglcnac ,d01qldg,science,learning,1455615118.0,xSialicAcidx,7.0,0.0,6800,890,0.0

who ever wrote this article has   no idea   how electronics work the claims about even conventional transistors or basic conduction are so terribly wrong that it makes me mad  let me start my more in depth response by saying the people at university of utah probably know what they are doing  though 3 yeas sounds like a long time for a proof of concept prototype  it is possible they mean a marketable design or something like that   but the interviewer is lacking on understanding  ok the first point is on basic conduction  here is a quote rom the article gt   sno allows  electrical charges to move through it much faster than conventional 3d materials such as silicon electrons generally move pretty slowly  you could out walk them  in a wire and what not  but that does nt matter because the fields propagate at a  significant portion of the speed of light   https  enwikipediaorgwikispeed_of_electricity   speeding up electrons means basically nothing and probably is not what is actually happening  gt  and because the electrons move through one layer instead of bouncing around in a 3d material  there will be less friction  meaning the processors will not get as hot as normal computer chips  this is a bald faced lie  friction does not come in to it  and in fact the more crosssectional area for a given conductor the lower the resistance so a thicker wire will conduct better heat comes from power which comes from current  voltage or or more relevantly  the energy for a charging transistor output is  voltage of supply   2   capacitance of the output node  so a reduced capacitance at the  drain  would mean a cooler chip a 2d transistor would likely have pretty low capacitances which brings me to my next point gt  transistors made with tiwari s semiconducting material could lead to computers and smartphones that are more than 100 times faster than regular devices  since the rest of his reporting is so bad i have no idea if he is just making that number up or what but i will go over what makes a transistor fast  here   http  flylibcombooks41021html2images0130338575graphics05fig03gif  is a diagram of a simple cmos logic family inverter  put in a 1 get a 0 and vice versa   i am picking cmos because it is super nice but most logic works in basically the same way let s look at what happens when vin goes from gnd to vdd  0 to 1   initially  the pmos is conducting  though it has some resistance  which pulls the output up to vdd but as the input voltage drops the it turns in to an open switch and no longer conducts as this is happening the nmos begins to conduct  again with some resistance  which starts to pull the output down to gnd the speed at which the output discharges and reaches a useable value for the next logic gate to start working is proportional to the  the capacitance at the output    current through the currently conducting transistor   so a lower capacitance at the output is faster  note that there is not an actual capacitor here just the inherent capacitance of the transistors and whatever the output is driving   the other way to increase speed is to increase current which can be done by increasing vdd  which will increase the power and heat  see  voltage of supply  above  or reducing the resistance of the conducting transistor  which usually increases size of the transistors  see  crosssectional area  above   edit  added specifics,d01feqx,science,learning,1455589839.0,LessConspicuous,8.0,0.0,15,3063,0.0

who ever wrote this article has   no idea   how electronics work the claims about even conventional transistors or basic conduction are so terribly wrong that it makes me mad  let me start my more in depth response by saying the people at university of utah probably know what they are doing  though 3 yeas sounds like a long time for a proof of concept prototype  it is possible they mean a marketable design or something like that   but the interviewer is lacking on understanding  ok the first point is on basic conduction  here is a quote rom the article gt   sno allows  electrical charges to move through it much faster than conventional 3d materials such as silicon electrons generally move pretty slowly  you could out walk them  in a wire and what not  but that does nt matter because the fields propagate at a  significant portion of the speed of light   https  enwikipediaorgwikispeed_of_electricity   speeding up electrons means basically nothing and probably is not what is actually happening  gt  and because the electrons move through one layer instead of bouncing around in a 3d material  there will be less friction  meaning the processors will not get as hot as normal computer chips  this is a bald faced lie  friction does not come in to it  and in fact the more crosssectional area for a given conductor the lower the resistance so a thicker wire will conduct better heat comes from power which comes from current  voltage or or more relevantly  the energy for a charging transistor output is  voltage of supply   2   capacitance of the output node  so a reduced capacitance at the  drain  would mean a cooler chip a 2d transistor would likely have pretty low capacitances which brings me to my next point gt  transistors made with tiwari s semiconducting material could lead to computers and smartphones that are more than 100 times faster than regular devices  since the rest of his reporting is so bad i have no idea if he is just making that number up or what but i will go over what makes a transistor fast  here   http  flylibcombooks41021html2images0130338575graphics05fig03gif  is a diagram of a simple cmos logic family inverter  put in a 1 get a 0 and vice versa   i am picking cmos because it is super nice but most logic works in basically the same way let s look at what happens when vin goes from gnd to vdd  0 to 1   initially  the pmos is conducting  though it has some resistance  which pulls the output up to vdd but as the input voltage drops the it turns in to an open switch and no longer conducts as this is happening the nmos begins to conduct  again with some resistance  which starts to pull the output down to gnd the speed at which the output discharges and reaches a useable value for the next logic gate to start working is proportional to the  the capacitance at the output    current through the currently conducting transistor   so a lower capacitance at the output is faster  note that there is not an actual capacitor here just the inherent capacitance of the transistors and whatever the output is driving   the other way to increase speed is to increase current which can be done by increasing vdd  which will increase the power and heat  see  voltage of supply  above  or reducing the resistance of the conducting transistor  which usually increases size of the transistors  see  crosssectional area  above   edit  added specifics,d01feqx,science,learning,1455589839.0,LessConspicuous,8.0,0.0,15,3063,0.0

you are going to find more and more studies describing the toxic  effects of glucose consumption goes on many people do nt know this  but sugars are used for a hell of akt more than just energy carbohydrates form the largest class of lost translational modifications and have been called the third language of life after dna and proteins glycosylation of proteins regulates everything from their half lives on the cell surface  where proteins are trafficked  how proteins fold  and even how proteins function for example  some ion channels have over 30  of their entire molecular weight in carbohydrates  and changing a single sugar on an ion channel in the brain can radically affect gating properties and yes  as time goes on  we recognize more and more that glycosylation patterns changes based on nutritional state  additionally there is a very very special type of glycosylation known as oglcnac which is the addition of a single sugar  glcnac  to intracellular proteins on serthr residues the function of oglcnac is many  but often times the same serthr residues that are glycsoylated by oglcnac are the same residues where proteins are phosphorylated in other words  oglcnac is like a master regulator of proteome functionality just like phosphorylation  but there are two things quite striking  1  oglcnac of the entire proteome is regulated by only 2 enzymes  ogt adds it  oga removes it  which is remarkably different than phosphorylation which requires hundreds if not thousands of different kinases and phosphatases  and 2  the substrate for the oglcnac modification  glcnac  is a direct product from glycolysis and primary glucose metabolism through what is known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway so what kinds of proteins are modified by oglcnac  well  we ve known for almost 30 years now that your chromatin is heavily glycsoylated and that it is from oglcnac decades later we ve found that oglcnac is found on histones  so it is part of the histone code and histone epgenetics   nearly every transcription factor is glycsoylated by oglcnac  that rna poly ii can not read your genes and bind to dna without being glycsoylated by oglcnac  and that all 3 humantet enzymes  which are involved in regulating dna methylation  are modified by oglnac if you see the big picture  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is sort of like an exquisite super computing biosensor developed by nature that can take environment  space  time  nutrition  etc and can alter glucose fluxes to regulate the amount of substrate that s available to perform the oglcnac modification oglcnac mechanics can then regulate everything from protein function to which genes are directly transcribed by rna poly ii to writing your epigenetics a lot of things go wrong during super fed high glucose states or when glucose metabolism is disturbed  for example  diabetes  cancer  and alzheimer s all have very well known glucose metabolism changes it really is nt surprising to learn more and more about how high feddiabetichigh sugar diets can affect the brain the connection between sugary diets and changes to genes proteins epigentics could very well be oglcnac ,d01qldg,science,learning,1455615118.0,xSialicAcidx,7.0,0.0,6800,890,0.0

nonpsychologists often conceive of dominance as an overt display of power  in psychological research  dominance is conceptualized as power of influence the actual strategy one uses does not determine dominance rather  it is about how much one desires to manipulate others  and how successful they are at it  this can also be true of  dominant  behaviors as well  such as eye contact in principle  it is not about staring or looking away it is whether your doing that is expressing a desire to influence someone s behavior  and how successfully you are influencing them a false display of submission can be an incredibly powerful way of manipulating people  and thus becoming dominant over them this strategy has the additional benefit of making it appear as though the dominant person is not responsible  and thus held liable  for the other person s behavior ,czzmxjw,science,learning,1455466411.0,idkwtfhell,756.0,0.0,1101,996,1.0

there s probably a lot of truth to it  if the goal of dominance is to get what you want  then it is one path in getting what you want let s take the research for what it is and say that people are more comfortable with male dominance  the other way to get what you want is to seek compassion  manipulate  act cute i d venture to say people are more comfortable with female using these  what is interesting about this research is that the implicit forms of dominance do not affect likability or hireability we might not be inherently turned off by dominance by woman in our lizard brain we might not be inherently turned off by weakness in men in our lizard brain  i d go out on a limb here and suggest that the reason we might get sexist results  for both men and women  when they seek to get what they want by feminine and masculine ways respectively  is due it appearing a contradiction  for example  if a man tries to be cuteweakmanipulate in order to get what they want  can people sense a conflict there if it is fake  if he is actually quite capable so they are repulsed by it  or if a woman tries to be dominance  but also shows weaknessmanipulates then are you going to be repulsed by her dominance  some powerful woman  can create an aura of repulsion if they display dominance and as i reflect on it  i think a lot of it has to do with them leaking a lot of weakness the primal part of people says  how can i be dominated by someone who leaks weakness whether it is her physical weakness  talking about being a victim  about how men oppress them or hold them back  if you look at it from a political perspective  were people turned off by margaret thatcher s dominance  i was nt around during that british era  but from i read  it does nt seem like it i think a big reason for it is her powerdominance did nt leak weakness she did nt complain about more powerful people stopping her she did nt complain about the glass ceiling  i think that s a real thing how can you demand subjugation through dominance  when you re constantly talking about how other people are more powerful that you or all the things that limit you  i think a lot of woman have real trouble with dominance as they ve been socialized their whole life to express their weaknesses and get help  the opposite is true of men  men have a lot of trouble with get sympathy because they ve been socialized their whole life to hide their weaknesses  the result is i think naturally that people are repulsed by the contradiction that often results people can cross that barrier  but it is harder ,czzofp5,science,learning,1455469128.0,scamper_22,21.0,0.0,1,6588,0.0
