first  some background information   nasa powers outer solar system probes  such as  new horizons   https  enwikipediaorgwikinew_horizons   with  radioisotope thermoelectric generators   https  enwikipediaorgwikiradioisotope_thermoelectric_generator   rtgs   these are passive nuclear systems fueled by the decay of  plutonium238   https  enwikipediaorgwikiplutonium238   pu238    there is an  impending bottleneck   http  wwwscientificamericancomarticlewithinnasaaplutoniumpowerstruggle  in the supply of pu238 due to a decadeslong hiatus in its production by the us department of energy  which will somewhat limit outer planet probe options in coming years  at least beyond jupiter  where highefficiency solar cells have become practical    pu238 is a specific isotope of plutonium that  when produced at high grades  efficiently generates heat by its radioactive decay it is not the same as plutonium isotopes used in producing nuclear fission fuel or weapons  and as such nasa can not simply borrow plutonium from these applications probegrade pu238 must specifically be manufactured   this manufacturing has recently restarted at a low level  but it will take years to ramp up two years of effort in 2014 and 2015 were required to create the first 50 grams of rtggrade plutonium under the new production  and at an 8figure cost that congress had balked at for years the rate will increase  of course  but   kilograms   of the isotope are needed for each rtgpowered probe  and only 15 kg of new fuel are expected to be produced by 2021  now  i ve been reading up on apollo 13  and an  interesting factoid   https  enwikipediaorgwikiapollo_13  spacecraft_location  came to my attention  the apollo 13 lunar module  lm  was ditched into the pacific ocean when the crew reentered earth s atmosphere in the command module  on board that lm were a series of longterm lunar experiments  and a certain type of generator to power them guess what kind of generator  yup  an rtg with 38 kilograms of pu238  none of which was ever used because the apollo 13 lm never landed  and thus the fuel was never inserted into the generator for the experiments  to avoid contaminating the oceans with radioactive material in the event of aborts or accidents  that particular design of rtg  the  snap27   https  enwikipediaorgwikisystems_for_nuclear_auxiliary_power  snap27   was designed to   survive reentry intact    and it reportedly did so in the apollo 13 return ongoing monitoring of the area has not detected radioactive leaks  i m sure you see where this is going  but there are specific questions that are worth asking    1  what would be the condition of that fuel after almost half a century of passive decay    since i am not a nuclear engineer  i ca nt answer this categorically wikipedia says the halflife of pu238 is 877 years probe rtgs degrade in function much more quickly than that because the radioactivity erodes their physical components  and because power output declines as the decay proceeds  but in this case we are only interested in the state of the fuel  so  if  this is a straightforward matter of applying the halflife  a strong majority of that 38 kilograms should not yet have decayed in the 46 years since apollo 13 is that the case  and if so  does this decay ratio directly indicate the amount of useful fuel available  let s assume the fuel is largely undecayed  the next questions would be about getting to it the apollo 13 snap27 was impacted into the  tonga trench   https  enwikipediaorgwikitonga_trench   an area of the south pacific just north of new zealand  at a depth of about 61 kilometers    2  does nasa have a good fix on the location of the snap27    if the landing ellipse for the rtg is a significant span of ocean floor  then this concept dies here  the time and money to find it would cancel out any advantage to nasa of recovering the fuel if they know where it is  or have it within a narrow range  then it s worth continuing to explore    3  what is the practicality of recovering it    to give a sense of the size of a snap27  here s a photo of one on the moon  https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbb3snap27_on_the_moonjpg you can see from the footprints in the background that it s quite small so that means finding it would be somewhat harder if nasa s idea of its location is more generalized  but also means that picking it up and taking it away once it s found would be trivial  assuming no leaks are detected  since that would invoke strict environmental protocols that would preclude transporting it  from the violence of reentry and ocean impact  most likely it s nothing more than a cylinder  by now covered is some thickness of seafloor muck visual identification would therefore be harder  and of course you would  hope  that it could nt be detected by its heat  for the reasons mentioned before so the operational side of immediately finding the object  even if its location is closely known  would not be trivial  systems exist  and have existed for a long time  that are capable of operating at 6 km and recovering an object that small  especially robotic submersibles james cameron has personally been nearly  twice as deep   http  wwwcbsnewscomnewsjamescameronreachesrecord7mileoceandepth   so the recovery technology is not in question  the weak link would just be seeing it we can speculate about various sensor methods  magnetic  seismic  etc  but this remains an open question    4  if recovered and processed  would the total cost and time yield significant net advantages to nasa outer planets exploration    of course the skeptic s temptation is just to say  if it were worthwhile  they would already be doing it   but that does nt reflect the reality of a bureaucratic federal institution that is constantly buffeted by both internal and congressional politics the fact that they are not currently trying to recover the apollo 13 plutonium means almost nothing  since of course every idea has to start somewhere  even if there had already been proposals that went nowhere  there are so many nontechnical reasons why that happens that it usually does mean nothing  eg  if the department under which the proposal occurred got its budget cut and did nt have the time to investigate it  the individual pushing for it left nasa  or died  or found a more interesting project  it was passed from one office to another until people just forgot about it  etc etc the vast majority of ideas that ever come up  go nowhere for reasons like that  so neither answer to this question would be shocking  that it would be a complete waste of time and money that s already been thoroughly investigated and rejected  or that it would make sense but just never came up in any place high enough to matter  the fact that nasa is  optimistically   one might even say desperately  touting the planned creation of a mere 15 kg of new fuel over the next halfdecade  an absurdly long timeline that even then is sparking skepticism due to low funding levels  suggests this might be worth a look      update  according to  this article   http  wwwspacesafetymagazinecomaerospaceengineeringnuclearpropulsionwillanyonerecoverapollo13splutonium   courtesy of schroedingerspen in comments  the fuel has decayed too far and would also be too difficult to locate it does nt give many details on that  but it is a plausible answer from a credible source greater details would be appreciated if anyone has them in any case  the plutonium issue is a fascinating one to explore irrespective of the apollo 13 question   ,45vg7a,space,learning,1455522864.0,KubrickIsMyCopilot,46.0,0.0,30544,74640,0.0

from the video description  gt  the pws plasma wave instrument on voyager 2 recorded these signals as the spacecraft was approaching jupiter on july 2  1979  between 1556 and 1645 spacecraft event time  essentially utc     these are the authentic sounds of jupiter   in contrast to the multitude of artistic interpretations and  therapeutic  mixes found on youtube that may be based on pws data  but have been highly manipulated and sound very little like the original signals   the audio presented here is not shifted in frequency and not filtered or mixed with music   gt  now  what do i mean by  sound  of jupiter  first  the sounds are not typically produced at the planet itself  but in the magnetosphere surrounding the planet  in this particular case  most of the signals are generated from the interaction of the supersonic solar wind colliding with the bow shock ahead of jupiter s magnetosphere  these waves are not the same as the pressure waves in the atmosphere that we normally think of as sound however  they do have some similarities   even though space is an excellent vacuum  it is  filled  with particles with a density of typically a few to several hundred per cubic centimeter near planets   most of these are charged and constitute what we call plasma being charged  these particles interact with each other without the need to  collide  as they do in the atmosphere moving charged particles both produce electromagnetic fields and waves and also are moved by electromagnetic fields and waves generated elsewhere   these are  plasma waves   many of these interactions occur at frequencies that are audible to humans   this does nt mean that a human ear could hear them in space  the pressures are far too small  but it is conceivable that   an ultrasensitive microphone could measure them   in practice  however  it is far easier to measure the oscillations in the accompanying electric and magnetic fields with antennas  and that is just what we do to produce sound we can hear  we simply do the moral equivalent of hooking our antennas up to an amplifier in order to drive speakers plasma waves can be considered  space audio     tl  dr  these are actual sounds produced by plasma waves in jupiter s magnetosphere if the human ear were more sensitive  it could actually hear these sounds  ,d00vkld,space,learning,1455559914.0,Sail_Etna,0.0,0.0,2203,129,0.0

what is an iridium flare  iridium flares are often mistaken for meteors because of their notable bright flashes of light in the night sky but they are actually caused by a specific group of satellites that orbit our planet an iridium flare is a specific type of satellite flare that is made when the antennas of an iridium communication satellite reflect sunlight directly onto the surface of the earth the satellites are in a nearpolar orbit at an altitude of 485 miles and their orbital period is approximately 100 minutes with a velocity of 16800 miles per hour the uniqueness of iridium flares is that the spacecraft emits flashes  of very bright reflected light that sweep in narrow focused paths across the surface of the earth an iridium communication satellite s main mission antenna is a silvercoated teflon antenna array that mimics nearperfect mirrors  the array is angled at 40 degrees away from the axis of the body of the satellite this can provide a specular reflection of the sun s disk  periodically causing a dazzling glint of reflected sunlight at the earth s surface  the specular reflection is probably less than 50 miles wide  so each flare can only be viewed from a fairly small area the flare duration can last from anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds and can easily be seen by the naked eye  this image is one 30 second frame from a time lapse of the milky way amp  other features of the night sky in motion against a silhouetted foreground photographed in western maine  this shot includes quite a bit of light pollution amp  some fast moving cloud cover most of the light pollution in this image is coming from farmington  maine which is about 35 miles from this location  exif  nikon d600 amp  1424  14mm  f28  30 secs  iso 3200,d00td8n,space,learning,1455556719.0,MikeTaylorPhoto,9.0,0.0,23251,1297,0.0

when i was a kid growing up in the late 70 s80 s  my uncle got a job at nasa when your a kid  and your uncle is a nasa you think he is the coolest guy ever he sent photos of astronauts and i was so fascinated by it when i finally got to meet him  he lived in fl  i in ny  he told me stories about how fed up nasa was when it came to safety and organization  and how one time he saw a friend of his die it was really sad apparently there is a room with poisonous gas in it  and when the hazard lights go off  they flood the room with air to dilute it so it becomes safe to enter apparently  this third guy with the air meter just stuck his head in  and did nt go fully in  so my uncle s friend  thinking it was safe  walked into the room and within seconds died  my uncle was the guy we called when the space shuttle blew up  and he immediately said it was the orings probably because it was too cold he talked about how tiles fell off it all the time  and how it really was like the millennium falcona piece of junk built by the lowest bidder still  i am very proud of my uncle  since retired   the fact that he was there at the height of one of the most exciting journeys we have taken  is pretty amazing ,d00oa5g,space,learning,1455548499.0,tommygunz007,4.0,0.0,622,6813,0.0

nasa could not initially pinpoint or  track  the exact location of curiosity on the martian surface except via the use of overhead imagery there is no technology aboard the rover to allow for that kind of electronic locationfinding that would let them pinpoint its location down to a precise spot like gps allows  nasa would know roughly where the rover first touched down  down to say a few mile box of surface area  by examining the entry telemetry and extrapolating a touchdown ellipse target area from that  as well as using orbital assets above mars to help focus in on its location via radio signal strength then  using overhead remote sensing satellites  they photograph the area from orbit and pinpoint its exact touchdown location from that from there  they can guide the rover using its onboard cameras and odometer gear  which allows them to measure exactly how far and in what directions the rover has traversed that allows them to have a very good idea of where the rover is daytoday  especially when they reenforce that odometer data with subsequent overhead imagery  they can compare the imagery shot by curiosity with imagery shot from martian orbit by satellites to fix its location based on that imaging data   when nasa sends a signal to the curiosity rover  they do not need to beam the signal  precisely  to where the rover is even if the rover was miles away from where they thought it was  it would still receive the signal  because radio signals are not focused like a laser beam at the target they spread out and can be received over a wide area  so if you were 10 miles away from curiosity on mars with a radio receiver  you would still easily be able to pick up the signal being sent to curiosity if you were monitoring the correct frequencies ,d01z291,space,learning,1455637771.0,Falcon109,2.0,0.0,1,43928,1.0

gps works just fine for planes in the southern hemisphere you re confusing the plane s ability to know where it is with its ability to report that position back to control towers consistently over time the missing jets knew where they were the whole time the problem is that the rest of the world was nt being updated on that data in a timely fashion when they went missing  as for curiosity  it actually was very tricky to know its exact location and the fact we know it so well was the culmination of decades of previous work and other missions to set up proper navigation systems  the early planetary probes were just lobbed in the general direction of the planet they were trying to reach some of the early ones completely missed even the successful early landers only knew where they were to within several hundred miles until very recently  this has improved for a number of reasons one is that space tracking radio dishes are far better than they were nasa s  deep space network   https  enwikipediaorgwikinasa_deep_space_network  is a set of gigantic radio telescopes reserved for tracking and communicating to space probes you can know the exact direction of the probe by adjusting the direction of the dish and identifying the point in the sky where the probe s signal is the strongest this has evolved to the point where we can localize something to incredibly precise angles as for distance  we can use doppler shift measurements of the radio signals to know the probe s relative speed to us to within fractions of a mms you add that speed up over the travel time of the probe  combined with the knowledge of the direction it is from us and you get a fairly precise knowledge of where it is in 3d space there s a cool  website   http  eyesnasagovdsndsnhtml  that shows in real time what probes the various dishes are talking to  however  that s just for orbital probes a lander on mars has to descend through the martian atmosphere which is notorious for density variations and other unknowns which can cause a descending probe to be tens or hundreds of miles off target when it actually lands  although nasa had been getting better at eliminating that problem over the last few mars landers  this was solved with a set of mars orbiters  mars odyssey   https  enwikipediaorgwiki2001_mars_odyssey    mars express   https  enwikipediaorgwikimars_express   a european mission  and the  mars reconnaissance orbiter   https  enwikipediaorgwikimars_reconnaissance_orbiter  all were equipped with special navigation beacons that other incoming probes can listen to we know where all 3 of those orbiters are at with the aforementioned technologies so they are a very precise set of guideposts any other subsequent probes can listen to the radio beacons as they arrive at mars and use triangulation and other techniques to nail down their trajectory to make their own orbital insertion or mars landing far more precise  additionally  we ve been mapping out the surface of mars in extremely fine detail the lack of significant atmosphere and oceans means that it s very easy to photograph the surface in very fine detail the mars reconnaissance orbiter did just that it was equipped with an   extremely   high resolution camera and a massive  high data rate data communication system  note  the mro has returned more data  terrabytes now  than all other planetary missions combined  the mro has now mapped out pretty much the whole surface of mars to under 1m resolution you could literally spot a person standing on the surface of mars with this data  the super camera is called hirise and has its own youtube  channel   https  wwwyoutubecomchanneluc6rkuscayuuqmra1mad9xa  if you want to see the sort of data it returns  we now know the exact location of many of the previous landers because hirise is so powerful  we can spot them on the surface some of the early probes  locations were only known to within a few hundred miles until very recently when we could finally figure out where they had been the whole time  so before curiosity even was launched  we had super resolution maps of the landing zone and navigation beacons in orbit around mars as curiosity did the final orbital approach to mars  the navigation beacons  and the dsn radio network guidance  let us know exactly where in space curiosity was it could then do last minute course corrections to enter the atmosphere exactly where we wanted also  the orbiters were able to give realtime data on the martian atmospheric density so the entry path could be more accurate  once curiosity started reentry  it had onboard inertial measurement units that tell it how far and how fast it has gone any deviations from what was planned could be corrected by banking the heat shield and allowing curiosity to steer its path to do small corrections on the way down similar  if less precise  reentry steering was used as early as apollo  and possibly earlier  i do nt know off the top of my head  as shown in this  old video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aw5ozq4tqew    atmospheric steering part starts at about 6  30  finally  as curiosity did the final  powered descent  it was equipped with onboard mapping radar it also had a 3d topographic map of the landing zone from the mro data it was able to see the shape of the terrain where it was headed and compare it in real time to the topo map it could then do the last bit of fine steering to end up exactly where it wanted to be iirc  it landed within a km or so if the intended target the famous  7 minutes of terror   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  h2i8aob1xgu  video nasa made just before the landing shows these last stages very well  after landing  mro and the other orbiters took pictures of the landing site and confirmed exactly where it was at in fact  the final approach was so accurate that mro was able to actually snap a  picture   http  marsnasagovmslmultimediaimages  imageid  4242  of curiosity descending on its parachute that is incredible because there s a lightspeed communication delay so mro had to be preprogrammed to snap a picture of where they expected curiosity would be  going hundreds of mph from a camera up in orbit  the whole thing is a massive triumph of engineering spanning several decades the incredible accuracy we have now for curiosity did nt just happen on its own it s been slowly improving with each mission and is the result of a mindboggling amount of time  money  talent and work ,d01s2at,space,learning,1455621222.0,DanHeidel,7.0,0.0,175,12465,0.0

from the video description  gt  the pws plasma wave instrument on voyager 2 recorded these signals as the spacecraft was approaching jupiter on july 2  1979  between 1556 and 1645 spacecraft event time  essentially utc     these are the authentic sounds of jupiter   in contrast to the multitude of artistic interpretations and  therapeutic  mixes found on youtube that may be based on pws data  but have been highly manipulated and sound very little like the original signals   the audio presented here is not shifted in frequency and not filtered or mixed with music   gt  now  what do i mean by  sound  of jupiter  first  the sounds are not typically produced at the planet itself  but in the magnetosphere surrounding the planet  in this particular case  most of the signals are generated from the interaction of the supersonic solar wind colliding with the bow shock ahead of jupiter s magnetosphere  these waves are not the same as the pressure waves in the atmosphere that we normally think of as sound however  they do have some similarities   even though space is an excellent vacuum  it is  filled  with particles with a density of typically a few to several hundred per cubic centimeter near planets   most of these are charged and constitute what we call plasma being charged  these particles interact with each other without the need to  collide  as they do in the atmosphere moving charged particles both produce electromagnetic fields and waves and also are moved by electromagnetic fields and waves generated elsewhere   these are  plasma waves   many of these interactions occur at frequencies that are audible to humans   this does nt mean that a human ear could hear them in space  the pressures are far too small  but it is conceivable that   an ultrasensitive microphone could measure them   in practice  however  it is far easier to measure the oscillations in the accompanying electric and magnetic fields with antennas  and that is just what we do to produce sound we can hear  we simply do the moral equivalent of hooking our antennas up to an amplifier in order to drive speakers plasma waves can be considered  space audio     tl  dr  these are actual sounds produced by plasma waves in jupiter s magnetosphere if the human ear were more sensitive  it could actually hear these sounds  ,d00vkld,space,learning,1455559914.0,Sail_Etna,0.0,0.0,2203,129,0.0

from what i understand  ion engines are very efficient and can constantly run for long periods of time on electrical energy however  current ion engines take days just to accelerate to 60 mph in the future though  in larger spacecraft for deep space manned missions  are large scale ion engines possible  could this hypothetical spacecraft be equipped with multiple rtg s or perhaps even house a full nuclear fission reactor to power multiple large ion engines concurrently  i m not an expert at the physics behind ion engines so i do nt know if having bigger and multiple engines will increase the rate of acceleration to be practical for fast travel across the solar system  any thoughts on the practical applications for the future of manned space missions  obviously chemical rockets are impractical for deep space and long term missions i also do nt think solar sails are the best replacements either for deep space exploration ,45xshe,space,learning,1455559830.0,generalheed,6.0,0.0,2,37,0.0

what is an iridium flare  iridium flares are often mistaken for meteors because of their notable bright flashes of light in the night sky but they are actually caused by a specific group of satellites that orbit our planet an iridium flare is a specific type of satellite flare that is made when the antennas of an iridium communication satellite reflect sunlight directly onto the surface of the earth the satellites are in a nearpolar orbit at an altitude of 485 miles and their orbital period is approximately 100 minutes with a velocity of 16800 miles per hour the uniqueness of iridium flares is that the spacecraft emits flashes  of very bright reflected light that sweep in narrow focused paths across the surface of the earth an iridium communication satellite s main mission antenna is a silvercoated teflon antenna array that mimics nearperfect mirrors  the array is angled at 40 degrees away from the axis of the body of the satellite this can provide a specular reflection of the sun s disk  periodically causing a dazzling glint of reflected sunlight at the earth s surface  the specular reflection is probably less than 50 miles wide  so each flare can only be viewed from a fairly small area the flare duration can last from anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds and can easily be seen by the naked eye  this image is one 30 second frame from a time lapse of the milky way amp  other features of the night sky in motion against a silhouetted foreground photographed in western maine  this shot includes quite a bit of light pollution amp  some fast moving cloud cover most of the light pollution in this image is coming from farmington  maine which is about 35 miles from this location  exif  nikon d600 amp  1424  14mm  f28  30 secs  iso 3200,d00td8n,space,learning,1455556719.0,MikeTaylorPhoto,9.0,0.0,23251,1297,0.0

what is an iridium flare  iridium flares are often mistaken for meteors because of their notable bright flashes of light in the night sky but they are actually caused by a specific group of satellites that orbit our planet an iridium flare is a specific type of satellite flare that is made when the antennas of an iridium communication satellite reflect sunlight directly onto the surface of the earth the satellites are in a nearpolar orbit at an altitude of 485 miles and their orbital period is approximately 100 minutes with a velocity of 16800 miles per hour the uniqueness of iridium flares is that the spacecraft emits flashes  of very bright reflected light that sweep in narrow focused paths across the surface of the earth an iridium communication satellite s main mission antenna is a silvercoated teflon antenna array that mimics nearperfect mirrors  the array is angled at 40 degrees away from the axis of the body of the satellite this can provide a specular reflection of the sun s disk  periodically causing a dazzling glint of reflected sunlight at the earth s surface  the specular reflection is probably less than 50 miles wide  so each flare can only be viewed from a fairly small area the flare duration can last from anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds and can easily be seen by the naked eye  this image is one 30 second frame from a time lapse of the milky way amp  other features of the night sky in motion against a silhouetted foreground photographed in western maine  this shot includes quite a bit of light pollution amp  some fast moving cloud cover most of the light pollution in this image is coming from farmington  maine which is about 35 miles from this location  exif  nikon d600 amp  1424  14mm  f28  30 secs  iso 3200,d00td8n,space,learning,1455556719.0,MikeTaylorPhoto,9.0,0.0,23251,1297,0.0

a few valid reasons first off  we should visit them for the same reason we visit anywhere else  for curiosity s sake and the technical challenge we should visit to broaden our awareness of our own planetary neighbours  and use them as models for testing our theories on how the various iterations of matter and energy that permeate our universe behave and interact  either confirming or disproving the assumptions we make we should go to discover the unexpected  the unanticipated  less philosophically  we should visit the ice giants to learn more about the formation of our solar system  so that we may better model those of other stars furthermore  most of the planets we are discovering outside of our own system  and with the inclusion of  planet 9   within it  have similar compositions to the ice giants by better understanding these two planets  we can extrapolate that knowledge and apply it to  by the time we actually got there  the thousands of other similar planets in our galaxy  furthermore  with the development of nasa s sls rocket  we can now actually do it  and should  considering how much the bloody thing costs and how starved it is for missions to justify its existence  here   http  wwwtheatlanticcomsciencearchive201602uranusisthebestplanet458724  is a fun  wellinformed article that s been circulating within online space exploration communities this past week on how awesome uranus is  written by david moscato and published on feb 2 in  the atlantic  should inspire you ,d00dawv,space,learning,1455514064.0,mahayanah,18.0,0.0,11,342,0.0
for your third question  a number of reasons  the main ones are that they re too far away  the next hohmann transfer window is in 2019  and it d take  3040 years to get there without a jupitersaturn assist  of which there are neither this window  the next window is  2040   where there are saturn assists  still adding up to about a 20year trip  also  solar power does nt work there we need rtgs  and we re basically out of them  the whole reason juno is using solar power instead of them we may be making more soon  though  which could change this  finally  it s not all that interesting there all the cool moons and atmospheric patterns are around jupiter and saturn  and with those two major issues above  we may not visit those planets for a while ,d00drle,space,learning,1455515148.0,IAmTotallyNotSatan,4.0,0.0,41,1999,0.0

yeah  people are getting way in over their heads with these gravity waves and thinking cool advanced tech will come from this discovery sorry to break it to you guys  but it wo nt the three biggest points i ve seen people bring up are  can we harness gravity waves as a potential means of transportation  can we harness gravity waves as a means of communication  can we use gravity waves to detect planets around other stars  the answer to all 3 of those questions is no gravity waves are incredibly weak when you think about the masses involved that create them just like how the force of gravity is much weaker than em force  so too are the waves any potential means of transportation or communication is many many orders of magnitude easier using em waves than gravity waves the only real good thing gravity waves are good for are  seeing  phenomenon that do nt emit much light  ie black holes moving through space ,d016mh5,space,learning,1455575945.0,jefecaminador1,9.0,0.0,456,8427,0.0
gravity wave detection is a confirmation of an aspect general relativity the same gr that says we are nt going to other stars any time soon  frankly you d have better reason to be hopeful for interstellar travel if we d proved gr wrong at least then we d have an idea where to look  this detection means the universe works pretty much the way we thought it did ,d01dkq4,space,learning,1455586971.0,Nerull,3.0,0.0,171,6436,0.0

the discovery has radical implications for observational astronomy  but relativityrelated science has not been a very prolific source of new technology technical applications have overwhelmingly come from the mathematical and quantum mechanical side of things  leading to the it revolution  there are some applications of relativity  eg  synchronizing signals from probes and satellites with ground stations  since there is a major difference of velocity involved but the gravitational waves that were detected came from black holes colliding  an event violent beyond imagining if humans ever work with energies on that scale  it would be too far in the future to be relevant to this discussion   on the other hand  you never really know where fundamental research can lead the people who discovered the theoretical and experimental framework for electrons could nt possibly have imagined where it led as they detect more and more of these waves and begin to gather more detailed data  it might shed light on other things and have cascading consequences ,d01k6jh,space,learning,1455597614.0,KubrickIsMyCopilot,2.0,0.0,30544,74640,0.0

i think the media has a lot to answer for amazing discoveries are made every day  week in and week out but for some reason they fixate on grav waves  before it was cern and particle accelerators they blow it out of all proportion and end up confusing the public even more  the media call it a new era in astronomy but in my opinion the new era in astronomy started in the last 20 years with cerenkov telescopes allowing us to detect gamma rays at ground level  see veritas  cta  and neutrino astronomy such as the icecube experiment  also advancement in solid state detector are pretty important and applicable to many different fields of science and eventually everyday life but you ll never see either of these in the media  we are 50100 years away from having a grav wave detector sensitive enough to really explore  the universe ,d01wd72,space,learning,1455633138.0,molochz,1.0,0.0,1,249,0.0

gps works just fine for planes in the southern hemisphere you re confusing the plane s ability to know where it is with its ability to report that position back to control towers consistently over time the missing jets knew where they were the whole time the problem is that the rest of the world was nt being updated on that data in a timely fashion when they went missing  as for curiosity  it actually was very tricky to know its exact location and the fact we know it so well was the culmination of decades of previous work and other missions to set up proper navigation systems  the early planetary probes were just lobbed in the general direction of the planet they were trying to reach some of the early ones completely missed even the successful early landers only knew where they were to within several hundred miles until very recently  this has improved for a number of reasons one is that space tracking radio dishes are far better than they were nasa s  deep space network   https  enwikipediaorgwikinasa_deep_space_network  is a set of gigantic radio telescopes reserved for tracking and communicating to space probes you can know the exact direction of the probe by adjusting the direction of the dish and identifying the point in the sky where the probe s signal is the strongest this has evolved to the point where we can localize something to incredibly precise angles as for distance  we can use doppler shift measurements of the radio signals to know the probe s relative speed to us to within fractions of a mms you add that speed up over the travel time of the probe  combined with the knowledge of the direction it is from us and you get a fairly precise knowledge of where it is in 3d space there s a cool  website   http  eyesnasagovdsndsnhtml  that shows in real time what probes the various dishes are talking to  however  that s just for orbital probes a lander on mars has to descend through the martian atmosphere which is notorious for density variations and other unknowns which can cause a descending probe to be tens or hundreds of miles off target when it actually lands  although nasa had been getting better at eliminating that problem over the last few mars landers  this was solved with a set of mars orbiters  mars odyssey   https  enwikipediaorgwiki2001_mars_odyssey    mars express   https  enwikipediaorgwikimars_express   a european mission  and the  mars reconnaissance orbiter   https  enwikipediaorgwikimars_reconnaissance_orbiter  all were equipped with special navigation beacons that other incoming probes can listen to we know where all 3 of those orbiters are at with the aforementioned technologies so they are a very precise set of guideposts any other subsequent probes can listen to the radio beacons as they arrive at mars and use triangulation and other techniques to nail down their trajectory to make their own orbital insertion or mars landing far more precise  additionally  we ve been mapping out the surface of mars in extremely fine detail the lack of significant atmosphere and oceans means that it s very easy to photograph the surface in very fine detail the mars reconnaissance orbiter did just that it was equipped with an   extremely   high resolution camera and a massive  high data rate data communication system  note  the mro has returned more data  terrabytes now  than all other planetary missions combined  the mro has now mapped out pretty much the whole surface of mars to under 1m resolution you could literally spot a person standing on the surface of mars with this data  the super camera is called hirise and has its own youtube  channel   https  wwwyoutubecomchanneluc6rkuscayuuqmra1mad9xa  if you want to see the sort of data it returns  we now know the exact location of many of the previous landers because hirise is so powerful  we can spot them on the surface some of the early probes  locations were only known to within a few hundred miles until very recently when we could finally figure out where they had been the whole time  so before curiosity even was launched  we had super resolution maps of the landing zone and navigation beacons in orbit around mars as curiosity did the final orbital approach to mars  the navigation beacons  and the dsn radio network guidance  let us know exactly where in space curiosity was it could then do last minute course corrections to enter the atmosphere exactly where we wanted also  the orbiters were able to give realtime data on the martian atmospheric density so the entry path could be more accurate  once curiosity started reentry  it had onboard inertial measurement units that tell it how far and how fast it has gone any deviations from what was planned could be corrected by banking the heat shield and allowing curiosity to steer its path to do small corrections on the way down similar  if less precise  reentry steering was used as early as apollo  and possibly earlier  i do nt know off the top of my head  as shown in this  old video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aw5ozq4tqew    atmospheric steering part starts at about 6  30  finally  as curiosity did the final  powered descent  it was equipped with onboard mapping radar it also had a 3d topographic map of the landing zone from the mro data it was able to see the shape of the terrain where it was headed and compare it in real time to the topo map it could then do the last bit of fine steering to end up exactly where it wanted to be iirc  it landed within a km or so if the intended target the famous  7 minutes of terror   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  h2i8aob1xgu  video nasa made just before the landing shows these last stages very well  after landing  mro and the other orbiters took pictures of the landing site and confirmed exactly where it was at in fact  the final approach was so accurate that mro was able to actually snap a  picture   http  marsnasagovmslmultimediaimages  imageid  4242  of curiosity descending on its parachute that is incredible because there s a lightspeed communication delay so mro had to be preprogrammed to snap a picture of where they expected curiosity would be  going hundreds of mph from a camera up in orbit  the whole thing is a massive triumph of engineering spanning several decades the incredible accuracy we have now for curiosity did nt just happen on its own it s been slowly improving with each mission and is the result of a mindboggling amount of time  money  talent and work ,d01s2at,space,learning,1455621222.0,DanHeidel,7.0,0.0,175,12465,0.0

nasa could not initially pinpoint or  track  the exact location of curiosity on the martian surface except via the use of overhead imagery there is no technology aboard the rover to allow for that kind of electronic locationfinding that would let them pinpoint its location down to a precise spot like gps allows  nasa would know roughly where the rover first touched down  down to say a few mile box of surface area  by examining the entry telemetry and extrapolating a touchdown ellipse target area from that  as well as using orbital assets above mars to help focus in on its location via radio signal strength then  using overhead remote sensing satellites  they photograph the area from orbit and pinpoint its exact touchdown location from that from there  they can guide the rover using its onboard cameras and odometer gear  which allows them to measure exactly how far and in what directions the rover has traversed that allows them to have a very good idea of where the rover is daytoday  especially when they reenforce that odometer data with subsequent overhead imagery  they can compare the imagery shot by curiosity with imagery shot from martian orbit by satellites to fix its location based on that imaging data   when nasa sends a signal to the curiosity rover  they do not need to beam the signal  precisely  to where the rover is even if the rover was miles away from where they thought it was  it would still receive the signal  because radio signals are not focused like a laser beam at the target they spread out and can be received over a wide area  so if you were 10 miles away from curiosity on mars with a radio receiver  you would still easily be able to pick up the signal being sent to curiosity if you were monitoring the correct frequencies ,d01z291,space,learning,1455637771.0,Falcon109,2.0,0.0,1,43928,1.0

first  some background information   nasa powers outer solar system probes  such as  new horizons   https  enwikipediaorgwikinew_horizons   with  radioisotope thermoelectric generators   https  enwikipediaorgwikiradioisotope_thermoelectric_generator   rtgs   these are passive nuclear systems fueled by the decay of  plutonium238   https  enwikipediaorgwikiplutonium238   pu238    there is an  impending bottleneck   http  wwwscientificamericancomarticlewithinnasaaplutoniumpowerstruggle  in the supply of pu238 due to a decadeslong hiatus in its production by the us department of energy  which will somewhat limit outer planet probe options in coming years  at least beyond jupiter  where highefficiency solar cells have become practical    pu238 is a specific isotope of plutonium that  when produced at high grades  efficiently generates heat by its radioactive decay it is not the same as plutonium isotopes used in producing nuclear fission fuel or weapons  and as such nasa can not simply borrow plutonium from these applications probegrade pu238 must specifically be manufactured   this manufacturing has recently restarted at a low level  but it will take years to ramp up two years of effort in 2014 and 2015 were required to create the first 50 grams of rtggrade plutonium under the new production  and at an 8figure cost that congress had balked at for years the rate will increase  of course  but   kilograms   of the isotope are needed for each rtgpowered probe  and only 15 kg of new fuel are expected to be produced by 2021  now  i ve been reading up on apollo 13  and an  interesting factoid   https  enwikipediaorgwikiapollo_13  spacecraft_location  came to my attention  the apollo 13 lunar module  lm  was ditched into the pacific ocean when the crew reentered earth s atmosphere in the command module  on board that lm were a series of longterm lunar experiments  and a certain type of generator to power them guess what kind of generator  yup  an rtg with 38 kilograms of pu238  none of which was ever used because the apollo 13 lm never landed  and thus the fuel was never inserted into the generator for the experiments  to avoid contaminating the oceans with radioactive material in the event of aborts or accidents  that particular design of rtg  the  snap27   https  enwikipediaorgwikisystems_for_nuclear_auxiliary_power  snap27   was designed to   survive reentry intact    and it reportedly did so in the apollo 13 return ongoing monitoring of the area has not detected radioactive leaks  i m sure you see where this is going  but there are specific questions that are worth asking    1  what would be the condition of that fuel after almost half a century of passive decay    since i am not a nuclear engineer  i ca nt answer this categorically wikipedia says the halflife of pu238 is 877 years probe rtgs degrade in function much more quickly than that because the radioactivity erodes their physical components  and because power output declines as the decay proceeds  but in this case we are only interested in the state of the fuel  so  if  this is a straightforward matter of applying the halflife  a strong majority of that 38 kilograms should not yet have decayed in the 46 years since apollo 13 is that the case  and if so  does this decay ratio directly indicate the amount of useful fuel available  let s assume the fuel is largely undecayed  the next questions would be about getting to it the apollo 13 snap27 was impacted into the  tonga trench   https  enwikipediaorgwikitonga_trench   an area of the south pacific just north of new zealand  at a depth of about 61 kilometers    2  does nasa have a good fix on the location of the snap27    if the landing ellipse for the rtg is a significant span of ocean floor  then this concept dies here  the time and money to find it would cancel out any advantage to nasa of recovering the fuel if they know where it is  or have it within a narrow range  then it s worth continuing to explore    3  what is the practicality of recovering it    to give a sense of the size of a snap27  here s a photo of one on the moon  https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbb3snap27_on_the_moonjpg you can see from the footprints in the background that it s quite small so that means finding it would be somewhat harder if nasa s idea of its location is more generalized  but also means that picking it up and taking it away once it s found would be trivial  assuming no leaks are detected  since that would invoke strict environmental protocols that would preclude transporting it  from the violence of reentry and ocean impact  most likely it s nothing more than a cylinder  by now covered is some thickness of seafloor muck visual identification would therefore be harder  and of course you would  hope  that it could nt be detected by its heat  for the reasons mentioned before so the operational side of immediately finding the object  even if its location is closely known  would not be trivial  systems exist  and have existed for a long time  that are capable of operating at 6 km and recovering an object that small  especially robotic submersibles james cameron has personally been nearly  twice as deep   http  wwwcbsnewscomnewsjamescameronreachesrecord7mileoceandepth   so the recovery technology is not in question  the weak link would just be seeing it we can speculate about various sensor methods  magnetic  seismic  etc  but this remains an open question    4  if recovered and processed  would the total cost and time yield significant net advantages to nasa outer planets exploration    of course the skeptic s temptation is just to say  if it were worthwhile  they would already be doing it   but that does nt reflect the reality of a bureaucratic federal institution that is constantly buffeted by both internal and congressional politics the fact that they are not currently trying to recover the apollo 13 plutonium means almost nothing  since of course every idea has to start somewhere  even if there had already been proposals that went nowhere  there are so many nontechnical reasons why that happens that it usually does mean nothing  eg  if the department under which the proposal occurred got its budget cut and did nt have the time to investigate it  the individual pushing for it left nasa  or died  or found a more interesting project  it was passed from one office to another until people just forgot about it  etc etc the vast majority of ideas that ever come up  go nowhere for reasons like that  so neither answer to this question would be shocking  that it would be a complete waste of time and money that s already been thoroughly investigated and rejected  or that it would make sense but just never came up in any place high enough to matter  the fact that nasa is  optimistically   one might even say desperately  touting the planned creation of a mere 15 kg of new fuel over the next halfdecade  an absurdly long timeline that even then is sparking skepticism due to low funding levels  suggests this might be worth a look      update  according to  this article   http  wwwspacesafetymagazinecomaerospaceengineeringnuclearpropulsionwillanyonerecoverapollo13splutonium   courtesy of schroedingerspen in comments  the fuel has decayed too far and would also be too difficult to locate it does nt give many details on that  but it is a plausible answer from a credible source greater details would be appreciated if anyone has them in any case  the plutonium issue is a fascinating one to explore irrespective of the apollo 13 question   ,45vg7a,space,learning,1455522864.0,KubrickIsMyCopilot,46.0,0.0,30544,74640,0.0

 this article   http  wwwspacesafetymagazinecomaerospaceengineeringnuclearpropulsionwillanyonerecoverapollo13splutonium  answers at least the first part of your question to sum it up it seems that no one has tried to find its exact location because we designed it so that we would nt have to  from a safety standpoint  retrieve it  and it s not useable still radioactive  still outputting energy  but not at a level we would need for further use ,d00iujj,space,learning,1455532084.0,schroedingers-pen,5.0,0.0,1,4,0.0

by far the biggest reason that this is nt feasible is that it s in 20000 feet of water  and is roughly the size of a fire extinguisher it has no locating equipment  much less anything that would be functional after such a long time  and even if it did emit detectable gamma or neutron radiation  which it does nt   even those would only be detectable for a few dozen feet in water   you can see pictures of the cask here   https  enwikipediaorgwikiapollo_lunar_surface_experiments_package  it would be almost impossible to find in such conditions it would certainly cost far  far  far more than the plutonium is worth ,d01lfgf,space,learning,1455600068.0,CutterJohn,3.0,0.0,136,100012,0.0

two questions  1 is it a coincidence that the major moons of planets tend to be ordered from smallest to largest as you get further away from the planet  the five major moons of uranus follow this pattern  except the two outer moons titania and oberon which are nearly identical in size need to be switched around the 7 major moons of saturn follow this too  it would be perfect if it was nt for iapetus out in the middle of nowhere and i suppose the inner two galilean moons are much smaller than the outer two   2 how come jupiter has four of the six largest moons in the solar system  is it something to do with its mass  or the fact jupiter is thought to have formed first ,d00scqm,space,learning,1455555200.0,0thatguy,2.0,0.0,20942,27989,0.0

a few valid reasons first off  we should visit them for the same reason we visit anywhere else  for curiosity s sake and the technical challenge we should visit to broaden our awareness of our own planetary neighbours  and use them as models for testing our theories on how the various iterations of matter and energy that permeate our universe behave and interact  either confirming or disproving the assumptions we make we should go to discover the unexpected  the unanticipated  less philosophically  we should visit the ice giants to learn more about the formation of our solar system  so that we may better model those of other stars furthermore  most of the planets we are discovering outside of our own system  and with the inclusion of  planet 9   within it  have similar compositions to the ice giants by better understanding these two planets  we can extrapolate that knowledge and apply it to  by the time we actually got there  the thousands of other similar planets in our galaxy  furthermore  with the development of nasa s sls rocket  we can now actually do it  and should  considering how much the bloody thing costs and how starved it is for missions to justify its existence  here   http  wwwtheatlanticcomsciencearchive201602uranusisthebestplanet458724  is a fun  wellinformed article that s been circulating within online space exploration communities this past week on how awesome uranus is  written by david moscato and published on feb 2 in  the atlantic  should inspire you ,d00dawv,space,learning,1455514064.0,mahayanah,18.0,0.0,11,342,0.0

for people who are nt going to read the paper  from the abstract  gt  it was shown that the observations are consistent with the einstein theory of gravity with high accuracy limited mainly by the statistical error angular momentum and mass of the final black hole were determined with rather large allowance of tens of percents here we shall show that this indeterminacy in the range of the blackhole parameters allows for some not negligible deformations of the kerr spacetime leading to the same frequencies of blackhole ringing this means that at the current precision of the experiment there remain some possibilities for alternative theories of gravity  and then at the end of the paper  gt  this letter in no way contradicts to the einstein theory of gravity or cast shadows on the great importance of the recent outstanding discovery of gravitational waves in essence we simply illustrate that the current allowance in the determination of the black hole parameters can be interpreted as freedom for alternative theories of gravity as well ,d026k2t,space,learning,1455648303.0,macarthur_park,7.0,0.0,1,89334,0.0

big bang is religious street slang the first question that should be asked is if big bang even real  the second part we already know is nt real  a bang there was no bang the extremely dogmatic big bang being shoved down our throats is not the only theory and is far from being anything close to verifiable fact the big bang theory is being developed with empirical evidence but the evidence is not supporting the theory basics big bang is the catholic universe  taking what was once the 2d flat circle earth  now transferred to a 2d flat slice perfect circle universe trying to work backward to fit this theory model is not working  there are numerous events at the edge of the optical universe that are nt fitting the 2d model the 2d flat universe also uses the standard uniform accretion model and that model is wrong  http  iimgurcomns5u1ktjpg,d02opfh,space,learning,1455674157.0,moon-worshiper,1.0,0.0,1,1126,0.0
