explanation of the   7   rule  since it took me a minute to understand  your number  say  889  is split into 10x  y  or 880  9   we want to know if 10x  y divides by 7     so we multiply by 5   10x  y   5  50x  5y  multiplying a number by 5 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume m and n are integers a number   7m  n    where n is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  multiplies by 5 to become   35m  5n    dividing evenly by 7 must remove the 35m  leaving 5n 5n will not divide by 7 unless n  is  7  therefore if   7m  n   is not divisible by 7  neither is the product of it and 5     we then subtract 49x  which is   always   divisible by 7  and 7y  which is also   always   divisible by 7    50x  5y    49x  7y   x  2y  subtracting a multiple of 7 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume p  q  and r are integers a number   7p  r    where r is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  subtracts some value   7q    the difference remaining is 7p  7q  r  or   7  pq   r    because p and q are integers  pq must also be an integer  meaning 7  pq  is a multiple of 7 the remainder when 7  pq   r is therefore r as with the original number  meaning if   7p  r   is not divisible by 7  neither is the difference between it and a number that  is  divisible by 7     therefore  to see if a number of the form 10x  y    88   0    9    is divisible by 7  we may test x  2y    88      18    instead  hope this was helpful      ps this method is way easier than the godawful  1024  method  or however it worked   plus  this one chains    889  7   8818   7  70  7   70   7  7  7 ,cywfe4w,youshouldknow,learning,1452673203.0,ricdesi,1.0,0.0,2174,19864,0.0

8497100 seems like pretty good results  there s no such thing as a perfect antivirus as such when we score them we score them against others in the industry if you look at the green bars  malware actually blocked from infecting the machine using realtime scanning  in the avc chart you ll see nearly all of them are considerably higher than the  baseline  which represents mse now we re going to look at those numbers to make a few recommendations   there are a lot of options for free antivirus out there the numbers are nt everything  but they re very important let s look at some of the nonstatistical drawbacks of the top contenders so you wo nt rag on me for not recommending your favorite free av    avira   is out of the running because it includes a nag screen popup asking you to buy the full version there are ways to disable which involve hackery with file system permissions but that s for advanced users in my eyes this makes avira as  free  as winzip it s just an indefinite free trial    avg    while having respectable detection rates  has become an extremely bloated mess over the years it includes a bunch of crap you do nt need it is also prone to breaking things like your internet connection    malwarebytes   is not a comprehensive antivirus solution and the free version offers no realtime protection    avast   attempts to manipulate user s email without their consent by adding a   signature   advertisement to the bottom of all outbound emails it detects    comodo   sucks at detection rates  so what are we left with  here are the two best free antivirus programs as of the end of 2015    panda   http  wwwpandasecuritycomusahomeuserssolutionsfreeantivirus  panda has consistent toptier detection rates there is a nag screen but you can disable it permanently in the settings the drawback to panda comes in the performance hit panda ranks somewhere in the middle of the road for performance impact by both  avtest   https  wwwavtestorgencomparemanufacturerresults  and  avc   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201511avc_per_201510_enpdf   this performance impact is not going to be noticeable to your average user but if ricing your system is extremely important to you  move on to the final recommendation  on my windows 10 work laptop i run panda because i regularly connect it to potentially infected networks and sometimes must plug in possibly infected storage devices panda has nice usbscanning features like i said  computer repair guy here infected machines are a way of life for me not something i can avoid  if you re of the tinfoil hat variety  panda was founded by a scientologist but he is no longer the ceo there was some  controversy  in france in the late 90s about the thenceo making financial contributions to scientology no other allegations have been made relating to panda and scientology    bitdefender   http  wwwbitdefendercomsolutionsfreehtml    direct download link since some are having problems with redirects   http  downloadbitdefendercomnpdfreeantivirus_free_editionexe   if we re going purely by the numbers  bitdefender not only wins out over all the other free antivirus programs  but almost all of the paid versions as well the lowest score bitdefender received since march 2015 is 998  in the avc realworld test while regularly pulling in 100   in  october 2015 bitdefender got perfect scores   https  wwwavtestorgenantivirushomewindowswindows10october2015bitdefenderinternetsecurity20152016153791  for all metrics that avtest measures  i have a secondary windows 10 install on my main desktop and if i ran antivirus on it  i would run bitdefender my home antivirus is built into the network and i run linux 999  of the time so i do nt bother     but i m smart and i do nt visit shady sites or download sketchy files first off  quit acting like you do nt watch streaming porn you re not convincing me or anyone else i ve had dozens of customers look me square in the eye and insist they do nt watch porn while i have their motherfucking pornriddled   bookmarks bar   open in front of them if i do nt buy it from people who are paying me  i m not buying it from strangers already on the internet  second and most importantly  shady sites and downloads are not really what you should be concerned about the most what you should be concerned about are zeroday vulnerabilities in the software you run like flash  java  browser extensions  your browsers themselves   third party software and libraries used in other software you run   https  wwwopensslorgnewsvulnerabilitieshtml  y2015   and yes  even your  graphics drivers   http  wwwsecurityweekcomnvidiareleasesfixdangerousdisplaydriverexploit  which are exploited every day to serve malware to unsuspecting users via otherwise benign seeming means there are many completely trustworthy and legitimate sites and services that have been compromised to serve malware over the years  i do nt care how many science bitches made us more smarter  you should be running antivirus on your windows machine unless you re in it and know what you re doing no  building a couple of gaming rigs and running tron on your grandma s computer does not make you an it expert no   i ve never had an infection before and i do nt  is not an argument     but is there any reason to buy an antivirus program  short answer  no the primary reason for paying for antivirus is support that is  a number you can call where someone will remote into your machine for free and repair any issues that may come up as a result of viruses or the antivirus program breaking that can be handy for grandma who lives three hundred miles away and you do nt want to constantly remote into her machine to fix things your average user does nt need it  paid commercial antivirus programs usually are part of  security suites  that have a bunch of bloat features you do nt need or can get from other better  potentially free sources like password management  phishing protection  or browser filtering  and the final kick in the pants  more bloat  more opportunities to break kaspersky is considered the gold standard for detection rates it has been consistently at the top of the charts for many years however i spend an inordinate amount of time unfucking kaspersky because some part of it breaks  usually the updater norton is another antivirus that consistently breaks the machines it s installed on and can be a pain to remove if you do nt have the right tools one example is norton installs shell extensions  the custom options that show up when you right click on a file in file explorer  which regularly break in a way that causes file explorer to go into a launchcrash loop at boot making your pc unusable the less a piece of software does  the better chance it has of doing everything it does well    do i need a firewall to go with my antivirus  the answer is typically  no despite what hollywood has tried to teach us  a firewall is not some sophisticated piece of software with intelligently blocks hackers from your computer that kind of software exists  but is far outside the scope of even your typical power user a firewall simply blocks incoming and outgoing ports based on predefined rules windows comes with a completely passable firewall built in  as does every consumer router sold in the last decade if you re running windows behind a router  you re already behind two firewalls furthermore  the idea of someone  hacking  into your computer by breaking into it over a network is more or less  hollywood nonsense that does nt belong anywhere outside of bad ncis episodes   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  u8qgehh3keq   if your computer is compromised in a way to let an attacker in  it s because you ve been infected not because they broke through your two firewalls from behind seven proxies if you re actually at risk of being truly and properly  hacked  over a network  you re running servers on your network and hopefully know what you re doing already  i hope that was informative every time the discussion of free antivirus comes up on it turns into a huge confusing round of anecdotes and mud slinging hopefully this can address the common question of  well then what should i use   next time that discussion is raised  securing your computer is much more than just having the best antivirus  but that s not in the scope of this post maybe next time  happy computing ,40zh69,youshouldknow,learning,1452803671.0,HittingSmoke,197.0,0.0,23409,182269,1.0

i ll probably get flak for this and a bunch of downvotes  oh well if an item is very important to you and you are going to pack it yourself  because everyones  good enough  differs  over pack it guidelines say one layer of bubble wrap  put 2 layers on guidelines specify 3 inches of peanuts surrounding the item  put 5 or 6 inches of peanuts around the item when you fill the box with peanuts  overload the box  so when you close the flaps on top to seal the box up  it packs the peanuts tight around your item i have even seen a box in a box pack you item like i said  then get an even bigger box  drop a layer of peanuts into the bottom of it  put the small box into the bigger box  dump more peanuts into the bigger box and surround the inner box with them  again overfill the box with peanuts so when you close the lid  it packs tight  now a lot of people will call me out for over doing it yeah it s overkill  however if the item means a lot to you or is one of a kind  would nt you rather go above and beyond to give it a better chance of arriving  years ago i worked for a ups store  i learned a lot and we had a great team that packed boxes well  which is another option if you really deeply care about your item  break out the wallet and have the ups store folks pack your item now days i think they even guarantee their work now i m not saying every single package will always make it unharmed you would nt believe how many people thought that marking a box as  fragile  would be its armor fragile may be good for the drivers picking up and delivering your items  but once at a terminal or hub  large machines built for efficiency and not made to look for the word fragile will be bumping  sliding and moving your package around at a fast rate  in closing  ups is a good company towards its customers but as with any group there are bad apples they are my preferred carrier and ever since i shipped my first box and to this day  i have never had an issue  something like 15 years  i will give op credit for covering their ass on stuff  my advice here is in hopes that it never have to make it to that level ,d00lndt,youshouldknow,learning,1455542588.0,im_trainman,10.0,0.0,981,1949,1.0

i work for a company that received dozens of packages a day from ups  and ships out hundreds each day the biggest weapon you have in getting a successful damage claim is having the recipient deny the shipment due to damage  when the ups guy shows up at your door with a package  inspect the package before you sign for it if there is even a hint at damage  tell him that you want to either inspect the contents before signing  or just refuse the package because of damage especially if you are dealing with a mediumsized business  this will usually lead to a replacement being shipped  often before they even get the damaged back if you are shipping personal items  this obviously does nt help as much also  be careful  because they may try redeliver the same package again the next business day ,d01dmv7,youshouldknow,learning,1455587061.0,SovietShooter,1.0,0.0,266,7528,0.0

my best tips for shipping   if you can lower the weight and or value of a single package by separating them into different parcels  do this instead of paying for insuranceextra weight costs   if it is nt summer  be sure to add a little extra tape to seal all the seams of the box and even wrap a few around the entire circumference of the box in a    pattern to secure its shape   only ship through official upsusps locations  not any third partyaffiliated storefront because their package handling training and package liability are both garbage   if there ever is a problem  go to the location it was shipped  or the primary shipping center near you  and start demanding to speak with someone who can help you with your claim until you get help or speak with a manager and you can escalate things as needed from there their phoneemail techs seem trained to avoid liability for damage claims and i ve literally had them hang up midcall with me before not as easy to hang up on someone inperson  i ve worked with ups package handlers before  they do nt care what s inside the box you want to package your parcel in a way that makes it okay to toss on the ground or inout the back of a vehicle ,d014soz,youshouldknow,learning,1455573187.0,PseudoChris,4.0,0.0,30,765,0.0

ocd is defined as  excessive thoughts  obsessions  that lead to repetitive behaviors  compulsions    i hear people say all the time  this picture frame is rotated very slightly  my ocd is annoying me so much right now   or something like that first of all  this is not ocd  which has symptoms such as excessive hand washing  hoarding  extreme fear of pathogens  and excessive checking  like making sure a door is locked every 5 minutes  for example   this is a   mental disorder   that needs to be   diagnosed   by a physician  and is usually treated with ssris ocd causes major disruption in someone s everyday life secondly  being an extreme perfectionist like in the quote i said earlier better matches symptoms of ocpd  the p is for personality   this is still a disorder  but the traits that individuals with ocpd have  extreme perfectionism to the point where it severely hinders someone at finishing tasks  are common and are part of our brain in a more mild form  as we evolved this to help us with survival so although i dislike when people self diagnose themselves with disorders  unless they ca nt see a doctor and their symptoms are perfectly accurate  and are nt of low intelligence  cough  trump  cough    i d much rather have someone say they have ocpd when they get annoyed  not crazed like in ocpd  by something slightly off than selfdiagnosed ocd  although preferably perfectionist is best word   tl  dr  edit   the mainstream or slang definition of ocd better matches the clinical definition of ocpd  i m not saying perfectionists have ocpd  but ocd is nt that close to how mentally healthy people use it as an adjective to describe a personality trait  edit2  for people saying that they do nt see the purpose of this post  my main opinion is how using actual mental illnesses and disorders as simple personality traits  hyperboles  etc waters down how most people think the severity of the disorder is the mainstream definition of ocd has shifted to that of perfectionism   depressed  is now sad in the mainstream  and  bipolar  makes the average person think of switching moods or opinions rapidly as a result  people do nt understand the suffering of people with any of these like me ,4138e7,youshouldknow,learning,1452867037.0,MasterofBananaz,75.0,0.0,2920,5545,1.0

i have tmobile s unlimited plan and since my phone is my only way to access the internet since i live in a very rural area and isp s do nt come out here i easily rocket past the 23gb mark and still get the same 3045 mbps i always do the thing thats great about the plan is that you get deprioritized not throttled throttling means once you hit the set mark of gigs your speeds no matter what are slowed down to 2gedge speeds this is how atamp  t treats their customers that have the grandfathered unlimited plan after they reach only 3gb deprioritization means that if you go past the mark you still get access to full lte speeds but if a lot  i mean a lot  of other tmobile users start using their data then you get deprioritized to slightly slower lte speeds i never get deprioritized where i live since there are few tmobile customers on the two towers that handle the area i live in while after reaching 23gb and being in the various cities i frequent each with lots of tmobile customers i barely ever notice being deprioritized i still can watch and fully buffer 1080p videos on youtube in seconds  load pages speedily  and download files or apps with speeds that are only a couple mbps slower not megabytes persecond slower but megabits persecond honestly though anyone living in a market crowded with other subscibers will never achieve the full network speed provided by the few towers covering the market area you are always sharing the towers with other subscribers which means the more people using a tower the more everyone using data from that tower deprioritize each other anyways the main point to take from all this text is that you are more likely to notice speed slowdowns on any carriers network thanks to you and your fellow subscribers hogging data thoroughput from each other  especially during lunch hours   i m at 847 gigs this month of data use and i m still rocking the same speeds i get while not being  deprioritized  ,czyf9s1,youshouldknow,learning,1455369682.0,CHERRYxMUSTANG,2.0,0.0,1,12,0.0

my best tips for shipping   if you can lower the weight and or value of a single package by separating them into different parcels  do this instead of paying for insuranceextra weight costs   if it is nt summer  be sure to add a little extra tape to seal all the seams of the box and even wrap a few around the entire circumference of the box in a    pattern to secure its shape   only ship through official upsusps locations  not any third partyaffiliated storefront because their package handling training and package liability are both garbage   if there ever is a problem  go to the location it was shipped  or the primary shipping center near you  and start demanding to speak with someone who can help you with your claim until you get help or speak with a manager and you can escalate things as needed from there their phoneemail techs seem trained to avoid liability for damage claims and i ve literally had them hang up midcall with me before not as easy to hang up on someone inperson  i ve worked with ups package handlers before  they do nt care what s inside the box you want to package your parcel in a way that makes it okay to toss on the ground or inout the back of a vehicle ,d014soz,youshouldknow,learning,1455573187.0,PseudoChris,4.0,0.0,30,765,0.0
i ll probably get flak for this and a bunch of downvotes  oh well if an item is very important to you and you are going to pack it yourself  because everyones  good enough  differs  over pack it guidelines say one layer of bubble wrap  put 2 layers on guidelines specify 3 inches of peanuts surrounding the item  put 5 or 6 inches of peanuts around the item when you fill the box with peanuts  overload the box  so when you close the flaps on top to seal the box up  it packs the peanuts tight around your item i have even seen a box in a box pack you item like i said  then get an even bigger box  drop a layer of peanuts into the bottom of it  put the small box into the bigger box  dump more peanuts into the bigger box and surround the inner box with them  again overfill the box with peanuts so when you close the lid  it packs tight  now a lot of people will call me out for over doing it yeah it s overkill  however if the item means a lot to you or is one of a kind  would nt you rather go above and beyond to give it a better chance of arriving  years ago i worked for a ups store  i learned a lot and we had a great team that packed boxes well  which is another option if you really deeply care about your item  break out the wallet and have the ups store folks pack your item now days i think they even guarantee their work now i m not saying every single package will always make it unharmed you would nt believe how many people thought that marking a box as  fragile  would be its armor fragile may be good for the drivers picking up and delivering your items  but once at a terminal or hub  large machines built for efficiency and not made to look for the word fragile will be bumping  sliding and moving your package around at a fast rate  in closing  ups is a good company towards its customers but as with any group there are bad apples they are my preferred carrier and ever since i shipped my first box and to this day  i have never had an issue  something like 15 years  i will give op credit for covering their ass on stuff  my advice here is in hopes that it never have to make it to that level ,d00lndt,youshouldknow,learning,1455542588.0,im_trainman,11.0,0.0,981,1949,1.0

i work for a company that received dozens of packages a day from ups  and ships out hundreds each day the biggest weapon you have in getting a successful damage claim is having the recipient deny the shipment due to damage  when the ups guy shows up at your door with a package  inspect the package before you sign for it if there is even a hint at damage  tell him that you want to either inspect the contents before signing  or just refuse the package because of damage especially if you are dealing with a mediumsized business  this will usually lead to a replacement being shipped  often before they even get the damaged back if you are shipping personal items  this obviously does nt help as much also  be careful  because they may try redeliver the same package again the next business day ,d01dmv7,youshouldknow,learning,1455587061.0,SovietShooter,1.0,0.0,266,7528,0.0

  3 years working for a ups store   hey guys  i can give more specific information about step 3 so if you ship through a certified ups store and use a box purchased from that store it will automatically come with  100 of declared value like he said above thats not insurance but in the case that it does break and they find out it was ups s fault and you can prove that the item cost at least  100 they will give it backmaybe at my store its  2 for every  100 you add to your package so its a pretty good idea to get it  but only if your paying the store to pack it for you i have never seen someone pack their own package and win a claim  ups lawyers are insanely good at throwing your claim away and saying it was your fault the sad thing is ups is miles better than any other courier service and i would never trust my stuff with any other service well thats about it  any questions feel free to ask ,d00otx1,youshouldknow,learning,1455549520.0,UPSGuy123,18.0,0.0,1,13,0.0

for all you wondering why  ethanol and water go together better than gas and water what i mean is that ethanol will mix with water readily  like food coloring in water  whereas standard gas will not mix with water  but rather will float on top of water also ethanol will absorb   50   times as much water as gas  meaning you now have watered down fuel this water will promote rust and negatively affect the oil on the piston sleeve  causing it to not be as well lubricated  which in turn causes premature wear on your engine  destroying it  ninja edit  source http  wwwfueltesterscomexpiration_of_ethanol_gashtml,czlcikx,youshouldknow,learning,1454442569.0,ViperCodeGames,5.0,0.0,1467,6868,0.0

as your income increases into a new tax bracket   only  the money in that new bracket  not your total income  is taxed at the higher rate it s a myth and a fallacy that anyone would ever bring home less money after transitioning into a higher tax bracket  for example  with bernie s tax plan  someone making  250001 would have an increase in taxes in their  highest  tax bracket from 33  to 37   but it s not going from 33  to 37  of  total  income  it s going from 33  to 37  of income  between  250001 to  500000   because we use a marginal tax rate system so they re paying the same percent as everyone else on the first few brackets of their income  and only income  at or above  the  250001 mark would be taxed at a higher rate someone making  250001 a year would then have an increase in taxes in that bracket from  033 to  037  for a total increase of  004 a year  with  current tax rates   here s the total of what a single person with no children making  250001 a year pays in taxes  bracket ratetax  01845010    184500  184517490015    846750  7490115120025    1907500  15120123045028    2219000  23045141150033    645183  total taxes paid  5802933 as you can see  the tax in the 33  bracket is pretty low that s because they re only paying taxes on the  19550   250001230451  that they made  in that bracket   under bernie s plan  for example  the tax rates will change slightly here s how  bracket ratetax  01845010    184500  184517490015    846750  7490115120025    1907500  15120123045028    2219000  23045125000033    645150  25000150000037    037  total taxes paid  5802937 as you can see   only  the money  at or above   250001 is taxed in the highest bracket in this example  this person s taxes increased by  004 per year by switching to bernie s tax plan  you can use  this   http  wwwbernietaxcom  calculator to see how bernie s plan would affect what you take home every year ,44x5ca,youshouldknow,learning,1455031616.0,pooyah_me,24.0,0.0,233,3366,0.0

and it s perfectly legal  at least in the us unionizing is the process of joining forces with coworkers in order to make your workplace work for you  often times we associate unions with industrial employment  but even if you re an engineer  desk jockey  or service industries  you can unionize your workplace  working 60 hours a week  being called in on your days off regularly  are you asked to do jobs that are usually for another position  that you feel you should nt be doing  then you might need to talk to your coworkers and see if you re all on the same page  unions in the us get a bad rep for having strong armed industries  but we often take for granted what they ve accomplished there are other unions that are nt all about beauracracy and collecting dues  such as the iww  that are more focused on giving you the tools to unionize your own workplace if you need further help from such an organization you only need one person to pay dues to them  and they are on a sliding scale based on what you think you should pay  further reading  http  wwwiwworgorganize http  wwwueunionorgorg_stepshtml http  uaworgorganizenounionnorights,426y4y,youshouldknow,learning,1453488635.0,vincentxanthony,73.0,0.0,3278,14031,0.0

i really do nt get the point of this post first of all whether or not you describe yourself with a disease term should nt really matter in general if you re going to get offended or annoyed by people misusing words in their exact denotative fashion i would expect  retardmentally retarded  to be the primary example to which there is some validity but i still personally think you can express yourself however you like  especially if you are getting your point across effectively  second i really do nt understand why you think ocpd is more accurate because i believe it s less accurate in describing what people are doing when they refer to their behavior in a comparative way to ocd  with your example someone is getting annoyed with a picture frame not being parallel to the floor  probably   there is an obsession  things need to be organized in this or that way  and a compulsion  i will take this or that action to alleviate my obsession   ocpd on the other hand tends to revolve more around the strictness of a lifestyle this means scheduling is so important that alternative means can never justify the ends this means not trusting other people to do things for you because they could straight up fuck up your whole day by being slightly late or doing something slightly out of the ordinary additionally people with ocpd tend not to see the problems they have as problems but more of guidelines that a person needs to religiously keep in line with to live correctly  so correcting a slightly crocked picture frame  at least in the example of people misusing ocd  is nt the act of religiously keeping to a specific organization in order to function it s just something that s bothering a person and they want to act  have a compulsion  to relieve that irritation i do understand where you are coming from in terms of the perfection angle but that s not really the main component i was taught to focus on when learning ocpd in terms of differentiating from ocd ,cyzdele,youshouldknow,learning,1452877707.0,Carosion,7.0,0.0,1,559,0.0

for all you wondering why  ethanol and water go together better than gas and water what i mean is that ethanol will mix with water readily  like food coloring in water  whereas standard gas will not mix with water  but rather will float on top of water also ethanol will absorb   50   times as much water as gas  meaning you now have watered down fuel this water will promote rust and negatively affect the oil on the piston sleeve  causing it to not be as well lubricated  which in turn causes premature wear on your engine  destroying it  ninja edit  source http  wwwfueltesterscomexpiration_of_ethanol_gashtml,czlcikx,youshouldknow,learning,1454442569.0,ViperCodeGames,4.0,0.0,1467,6868,0.0

i work at a lawn equipment shop and around 80  of the repairs that come in are from carburetor issues due to bad gas i live in florida so the humidity with ethanol is a bad combination they also will not warranty any issues regarding fuel so do nt use any gas that s been sitting around in your shed for months  significantly cheaper to just buy a new gallon of gas than have the carb rebuilt or replaced on your machine  some gas stations have rec 90 fuel around here  mostly around a race track but you can also buy premixed oilethanol free gas like  this   http  wwwechousacompowerfuel  at your local lawn equip shop if you re a homeowner just trying to do some maintenance around the house that s definitely your best bet  it has a year shelf life once opened  if your equipment has to sit for an extended period of time run it dry and then remove the float bowl from the carb as some gas will still be in there ,czlrekd,youshouldknow,learning,1454464347.0,Boatguard,2.0,0.0,103,1112,0.0

i am a therapist insurance companies can ask us for clinical information about a patient to continue to authorize services and if we do nt provide it then they stop paying i do nt even have to get a signed release from the patient like in other cases when an agency is asking for such info  like the court system  cys  or another medical provider   and a summary would nt be accepted it definitely has to be the actual clinical notes unless they are ok with speaking on the phone this is usually required when clients move to different levels of care  verbal auth usually  but when i ve had clients on long term disability insurance always wants tons of my notes and it s all insurances not just aetna   edit  since this kinda blew up  other agencies can look at records too dept of public welfare  state level  and joint commission of hospitals  national level  regularly audit organizations and look at notes and records to ensure proper treatment is being conducted also supervisors in an organization will audit charts and notes to do the same i work for a large organization so many levels of administration above me can look at my patients records moral of the story here is that nothing is private nowadays but as many have stated below this stuff is being looked at to make sure good care is being provided and that fraud is not being committed   edit  2 i d like to add as well that  at least in my case  each and every time i have given records over to insurance  or provided verbal info  is to advocate for a patient to receive a type of treatment that i feel would benefit them  never to take away something so for example i turn over records in order for them to continue to get longterm disability payments and insurance for when their mh symptoms prevent them from working  or when they need a higher level of treatment if a situation arises where i feel an entity or organization is working against my patient  then you had better damn well believe i m invoking hipaa  clientclinician confidentiality  and throwing up a wall of  i ca nt talk due to privacy rights  statements ,czv4imb,youshouldknow,learning,1455134094.0,hot_toddy_2684,591.0,0.0,3542,11553,0.0

i think this is something you have to be careful with yes  doctors are humans  they do nt have all the answers  and they make mistakes but at the same time  they have years of training and experience in the medical field  so their opinion is likely more authoritative than yours keep in mind that they re professionals  trying to do what s best for your health  not customer service whose job is to appease you in general i d say seek a second opinion if you have a specific reason not to trust the first one  but do nt ignore a doctor s advice because you do nt like it ,cztuj6n,youshouldknow,learning,1455049155.0,Solution68,3.0,0.0,98,7578,0.0

not anywhere as serious as your condition by any means however i produce kidney stones in an insane amount i went years with urologist that just said nothing could be done and they would just hand me pain killers as they happened and blasted out the ones that were too big to pass i just kind of figured this is what life was going to be for me after close to a decade or so and well in to the 200 range of stones i got fed up quit seeing my urologist and started trying diet options for months at a time seeing what might have an effect beyond the few things they would just tell me to steer clear of i eventually landed on a diet that i felt helped me greatly reduce the amount i produced  but i still needed a urologist it took me weeks of searching and calling to find a urologist that was nt part of the same giant urology conglomerate in my area he turned out to be awesome  i was so lucky he cleared out the 4 or 5 big ones i had  helped me fine tune my diet and started me on meds to slow down production 2015 was the first calendar year i ve gone since 2003 with out a stone  i mean i had years where i passed 20 and finally a stone free year there s still one large one in a weird place that he ca nt get to with the laser but fuck it who cares i can deal with that monster when it moves  what s one more when my kidneys are all clear besides that one find a doctor that works with you  that works for you  do nt just assume they know what they are doing  or that they care  most do for sure but make sure they work well with you and what you are trying to accomplish  stay vigilant and stay healthy ,czu2uf8,youshouldknow,learning,1455060617.0,7fingersphil,2.0,0.0,5253,18261,0.0

a 2nd opinion has saved or prolonged a life twice in my immediate family   first  my halfbrother had renal cancer that had spread all over his doctor said that he probably had a few months to live  with no treatment options  he asked for a 2nd opinion and went to james cancer hospital in columbus  oh  and they said they had a treatment that had a shot of helping him  though it was pretty slim  it cured him it s been 4 years  and he s been cancer free the whole time   my mother had smallcell lung cancer that had spread before it was found the doctor told me we should just make her comfortable since she probably had weeks left they would nt even drain the fluid from around her lungs so she could breath while lying down  so i asked the doctor not to tell her that if she heard a doctor say   we think you re done   she would ve just accepted it because a doctor said it since my brother had seen results  i said to instead go tell her  we think your best option is to be seen at james cancer hospital  the doctor said   that s a good idea  i thought  _  why did i have to think of it    _ she went up there  and they said   sure  we can treat this  they drained her lungs  in her room   and she immediately felt much better then they gave her chemo and cranial radiation  and she lived another 15 months in fairly good conditionspirits   so yeah get a 2nd opinion doctors are just people  and they get stuff wrong the whole field of medicine is kind of a crapshoot ,czu1me7,youshouldknow,learning,1455058791.0,ShayneOSU,1.0,0.0,2172,15954,0.0

why should i know this  i believe it s better to be able to figure things out then have a bunch of rules memorized when it comes to stuff like math honestly  from taing physics throughout undergrad those were the people who frustrated me the most they could nt take a piece of information and see how it could be manipulated to get another piece several steps removed they just wanted to be able to plug some numbers into a rule they memorized and quickly spit out the number they needed i think teaching math this way makes people think that math is some archaic set of rules that s not applicable to their lives when it s actually a pretty powerful architecture for solving quantitative problems  basically these are cool tricks but i think there are easier ways to factor things like using the computers all around us also few numbers you encounter factoring in life will ever be  a  important enough to not round to the nearest power of 10  b  have 7 as the largest prime number they are divisible by ,cywatnm,youshouldknow,learning,1452661443.0,stormy2587,2.0,0.0,103,989,0.0

in any new relationship  people are infatuated with their so because their hormones are going crazy people are more likely to perceive the things they do in a positive light it s takes about 36 months for these initial feelings to die down sex only intensifies these feelings for a person you really might not know that well  waiting on sex gives you a chance to figure out if you really like that person and want to continue a relationship with them  rather than getting caught up in everything and prolonging something that is nt going to work in the end this also gives you an opportunity to build your relationship with verbal communication and other activities and if you do decide that this person is worth going further with  and have taken a few months to build a serious foundation  the first time will be that much better and worth while ,406s1j,youshouldknow,learning,1452355364.0,gorightthroughformsu,7.0,0.0,14,2,0.0

this was based on the thread below  extolling the virtues of using listerine and how its good for you since it eliminates 99  of bacteria etc one user even lists tables with bacterial growth rates showing why listerine is  a must use  thing these responses are assuming that having bacteria in your mouth is always a bad thing  and killing those bacteria with alcohol is good  https  mredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecomments44s60seli5_listerine_kills_bacteria_in_my_mouth_but_i except all bacteria in your mouth is nt  bad   your saliva has its own antibacterial agents and nuking your mouth is nt a very good idea it s a bit similar to why you would nt inject alcohol into your bloodstream  ie because they cause too much collateral damage  the same would apply for your mouth too that s why listerine  or any alcohol containing mouthwash  can have adverse effects just stop using listerine for a month  have a healthy diet  brush and flush thoroughly  and your breath would nt smell that bad at the end of the day  this is because it kills all the helpful bacteria  dries your mouth out and only promotes more bacteria growth since your saliva has antibacterial agents in it noticed how when you stay up all night  your mouth does nt smell as bad but take a couple hours sleep and it smells like a sarlacc  it s because saliva production goes down when you sleep and you end up with a dry mouth  alcohol does the same  combined with smoke  it can even contribute to oral cancer as alcohol is synergistic with smoke  ie it compromises the integrity of the cell membranes and can lead to the carcinogens  such as the ones in smoke  that are in your mouth to more easily go into the cells in your mouth and thus interact with the dna and cause mutations   http  onlinelibrarywileycomdoi101111j18347819200800070xfull this is all assuming that the alcohol concentrations are enough to kill 999  bacteria in the first place the alcohol concentration is nt high enough and you do nt hold it in your mouth long enough for it to do anything really it s been engineered so that it starts to sting a little bit after swishing it around and  therefore  you think its working it s not that useful unless you brushed before to break the plaque biofilms biofilms in general offer protection against alcohol  recent evidence from international research even suggests that the most effective strategy for beating back bad breath may be more about nurturing helpful bacteria in the mouth than about destroying the offending germs and their byproducts wiping out too many of the mouth s native bacteria could disrupt the usual checks and balances  making way for opportunistic species responsible for gum disease and other infections to move in and take over  your mouth is a kind of densely populated tide pool fresh breath reflects a healthy mouth  which is not necessarily one that lacks  bad  bacteria  but rather one in which overlapping bacterial colonies hold one another in check  http  wwwscientificamericancomarticlebeatbadbreathkeepmouthbacteriahappy tl  dr  if you want to have good breath and a healthy mouth  junk your alcoholic mouthwash  have a healthy diet  floss and brush twice a day ,44ts8s,youshouldknow,learning,1454975729.0,robbphoenix,40.0,0.0,16359,2267,0.0
