two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous ,d025gjj,food,lifestyle,1455646820.0,savemejebus0,1.0,0.0,65385,119089,0.0

color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look ,d01zvqf,food,lifestyle,1455639012.0,PrelateFenix,2.0,0.0,1,4126,0.0

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did ,464m4t,food,lifestyle,1455657035.0,omfreibe,0.0,0.0,1,5,0.0

treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it ,d02fzz4,food,lifestyle,1455660915.0,fuzzy_merkin,1.0,0.0,835,244,0.0

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl ,d01uwih,food,lifestyle,1455630017.0,Pocket_Monster,1.0,0.0,5237,5235,0.0

color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look ,d01zvqf,food,lifestyle,1455639012.0,PrelateFenix,2.0,0.0,1,4126,0.0

ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster ,d015bhj,food,lifestyle,1455573964.0,Aevum1,36.0,0.0,10609,38002,0.0
