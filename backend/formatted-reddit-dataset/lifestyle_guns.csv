this is my freshly sbr d cz scorpion evo 3 s1 it s a 9mm parabellum blowback rifle made in the czech republic by cz it started life as a  pistol  and it was trash  if you know only one thing about this gun it needs to be that without a stock it sucks ass but with a stock it s a blast to shoot and will bring a smile to anyone s face i m going to give you my thoughts on it in case you re thinking about getting one  for pros of this gun i d say it feels great in the hands even though it s a little over six pounds  it s a good weight it feels very solid when you re shooting it secondly its pretty accurate i was able to hit the steel plate at 150m with this very easily as long as my hold over was correct this gun is also just fun to shoot  between having very little recoil and slapping the bolt closed on a fresh mag  operating it is just different than a ar15 or ak i also think this gun looks very cool  its different then most other popular guns out right now mags are really pretty cheap  you can get them for  20 a pop which is nice the stock is very solid and works well to really sum up the pros of this gun  its just plain fun  now for the cons  which there are many like i said earlier this gun sucks as a pistol  one of the reasons being the ambi safety it rubs your finger and even breaks the skin after a while when you shoot so i bought the ambi safety delete from cz then there s the trigger  holy shit it s just bad  i really hope someone makes a smooth aftermarket trigger for it i replaced some of the springs to make it lighter  and it s still dog shit and now we get to the rails at the front  they are very uncomfortable to the point where im going to have to buy some rail covers for them  so if you re thinking should i buy this gun  you need to first ask yourself do you want to sbr it if the answer is no then do nt get the cz evo  but if you are willing to get the stock for it it makes a great little rifle that s tons of fun to shoot and is nt like anything else at the range i m not saying its better than the mpx or the ak9 or an ar15 in 9mm or whatever but it is a good gun if your looking for something fun to take to the range   here   http  imgurcomazvmbv  are a couple extra photos i took today ,d02dn22,guns,lifestyle,1455657743.0,vZeppelin,13.0,0.0,3989,3010,0.0

the best way to learn gunsmithing is to  1  have access to machines and mentors and b  have a different job that pays the bills and allows you to buy your own guns for gunsmith practice  buy tools brownells is your friend build an ar build a 1911 become a glockmamp  p armorer build a precision rifle and bed the stock  mount a scope  learn to do basic trigger jobs on common gun makemodels once you get better on your own stuff  do odd jobs for friends that will trust you with their guns ,d02g3yl,guns,lifestyle,1455661072.0,STANAGs,2.0,0.0,1,72,0.0

downvote away  but i m honestly not overly worried about this just trying to be a realist  possibility that a new justice may not even be appointed until the next president requirement that a justice be confirmed by congress necessity of the court to hear a relevant case before it can make a change  overturn established precedent likely possibility that the next president will appoint at least one more new justice anyway  given age and tenure  it s not like  bad man obama  can sling in some new justice and say   now go in there and take away their glockazines   1  is the appointment of a new justice a big deal  sure  it is an  influence  on scotus rulings for a long time is it something that warrants a knee jerk reaction  no ,czz0azb,guns,lifestyle,1455409607.0,therealjerseytom,20.0,0.0,1857,8243,0.0

becoming a machinist is a fine idea  but honestly only about 510  of the work i do as a gunsmith involves machining most of it is general repair  cerakoting  troubleshooting  problem solving  making or replacing parts  etc there is definately some barrel threading  drilling amp  tapping  and other machining  but a huge portion of the job is just repair i d bet most of the people in here offering advice have literally no experince or knowledge about the trade people always love to answer this question with made up info it s very interesting  a huge part of what i do is called  box o  gun   people try to fully disassemble their guns or fix them i end up with a box of 100 parts empty frame  dozens of similarlysized but importantlydifferent pins  weird shaped connectors and doodads  etc a lot of these guns are old and there are no schematics or pictures to help with figuring them out you have to use your deep knowledge of guns  how they work  and have an engineering  puzzlesolving mind you sit down for a few hours and you build the puzzle if you can do that  you can learn the machining and other stuff you need secondarily being able to build  box o  guns  is the most important skill to have  by far it s the same skill that will help you modify or make your own parts sometimes someone is missing a part  and replacements are nt available and there are nt even any pics or drawings of the part you need to use the same problemsolving mind to be able to figure out what that part looks like and how to make it and make it function ,d02rxpm,guns,lifestyle,1455679233.0,Small_Simple_Ships,1.0,0.0,727,1567,0.0

here is my brief review of the canik tp9sf  the newest gun in the tp9 series the tp9sf improves on the tp9sa  which has been called the best budget 9mm by many reviewers  by removing the controversial decocker and adding industry standard sight dovetail cuts  mamp  p front  glock rear   among some other minor changes i got this one for  368 shipped and aim surplus had them last week for  349 shipped  so these guns continue to be very affordable  let s get the bad out of the way  my particular gun did not run right i started noticing intermittent failure to fires towards the tail end of the first box of ammo the gun would release the striker  but it was not hitting the primer after the second box  the gun was failing to fire nearly every shot unless the trigger was released all the way the problem ended up being that the trigger bar was slipping off to the side of the firing pin block plunger instead of lifting it up and out of the way this would only happen with live fire  not when racking the slide manually  so it was a pain debug after finding the problem though  it was easy to remedy i simply bent the trigger bar nub that interfaces with the fpb slightly and now the gun has been 100  after about another 200 rounds  i sort of give canik a pass on this since the gun was probably working fine at the factory and did nt start acting up until the parts started wearing in a little  so qc testing would nt have seen it this part of the gun should be unchanged from the tp9sa  and really the p99 that the system was copied from  and i have nt heard of this issue through much googling i would chalk this up to a one off issue on my particular gun unless reports of this issue start popping up  i have pretty bad luck when it comes to this kind of thing   aside from that issue  i ve been really enjoying the gun the trigger is as good as advertised  extremely crisp break and short  distinct reset it makes the practical accuracy of this gun very good  i was surprised how accurately i could shoot this gun offhand and how effortless it was to just put the sight on the target and make the gun go bang the tight lock up of the barrel and slide give this gun good mechanical accuracy as well i did nt do a formal test  but shooting off a rest at 10 yards i was getting 15  groups without trying that hard  the gun also gets high marks on ergonomics  at least in my fairly average sized hands the grip shape is comfortable and points naturally  the stippling on the grip panels and the stubble on the front and rear straps are grippy but do nt bite into the hands the mag and slide release are located where i can get to them without shifting my shooting grip  and the trigger reach is comfortable for me for larger handed people  there s a large backstrap you can swap in  overall  i am quite pleased with this gun once i got the issue ironed out obviously  the jury is still out on long term durability  particularly if my  fix  holds up over a few thousand rounds the track record of the tp9sa has been pretty positive though  so i m hoping for good things for this model as well all i can say at this point is that the gun is very enjoyable and easy to shoot and quite the bargain at the price point ,d02ajw4,guns,lifestyle,1455653672.0,reshp2,3.0,0.0,115,2671,0.0

 1100 is a decent starting point  remember that accuracy is cheap and quality costs money  everyone will give you their experiences or opinions on their brand you can really be happy with any rifle company that you choose  but some are better than others  i do not like the tikka for short actions  because it is the same size bolt as their long actions  only one bolt size   if you like tikka the best  look at a 300 win  remington has qc issues  but has the most after market parts  so you could replace any of the parts you do not like  savage and ruger are solid options to start a build and many people are happy with them probably the most popular long range on a budget gun is the savage axis  sako is a better quality gun than the others that you have mentioned remember that accuracy is cheap and quality cost money you can get a sub 1 moa cheap rifle  but the money you would spend to upgrade the parts will leave you wondering why you just did nt purchase quality in the first place  there are other costs associated with building a long range rifle  a solid stock can cost up to  1000  chassis   bedding the rifle  200  trigger job  300  optics  2000  bi pod  150  etc,d020o6j,guns,lifestyle,1455640170.0,one8sevenn,2.0,0.0,2520,9693,0.0

do nt be afraid of buying a used shotgun if it is in good condition and from a quality manufacturer you can often buy something that is a lot nicer for the same money  and considering how many shotguns are still out there firing away after over 100 years  a good quality used shotgun will keep going for as long as you need it to with that whole world of shotguns opened up  you can concentrate on finding whatever gun seems to fit you the best the one that just feels right in the hand and on the shoulder there are loads of companies out there that make or have made great shotguns over the years  and people often find that the shotgun that looks so good to them on paper in terms of the features and whatnot just does nt feel good to them when they pick one up  for a shotgun that is mostly going to be used for skeet and waterfowl  you want a gun that will handle at least 3 inch magnum shells  with a longer barrel  28 inches is a good length without being too unwieldy   and one that tends to be heavier rather than lighter a heavier gun will kick less  and if you are shooting skeet or sitting in a duck blind  you are more likely to be shooting it a lot than carrying it around a lot ,d01ilcd,guns,lifestyle,1455594895.0,MerkinInACoalMine,2.0,0.0,49,1904,0.0

the a300 is a great shotgun it s basically just a bare bones semi auto in that it lacks many of the unique features of the a400 series like kickoff  blink feed  and the aquatech finish  but that should nt really matter i have an a400  and those are all nice  but in the grand scheme of things all your shotgun needs to do is be reliable and be able to perform the functions you need from it the a300 is a quality shotgun at a great price and it will serve you well as a skeet and a waterfowl gun  some other good guns to look at along with the a300 are the benelli montefeltro  franchi affinity  and winchester sx3 those should all be within your price range i say go and hold them all and choose the one that feels the most comfortable to you if i had to pick one it d be a toss up between the a300 and the montefeltro but again  i d go and hold them all and see which gun feels the best to you ,d01hv6q,guns,lifestyle,1455593730.0,Hambs,6.0,0.0,60,88,0.0

first off apologies to mods i submitted a few times earlier on a new account but it got removed  maybe because it was on a brand new account   i ll start with the gun   http  imgurcomwpkpreg  now  down to business i m considering taking this gun from a friend to pay for a loan  but when i asked my local gun shop they said beretta never made a regular two tone  only a reverse two tone  and that they would nt even be interested in buying it if i wanted to sell i looked up the serial number on the frame  and it comes up listed as a two tone manufactured around 2008 considering the serial number is on the frame  and the frame is black  this obviously never could have been a reverse two tone am i correct in assuming that beretta did indeed offer a factory regular two tone with the stainless slide  i want to make sure i do nt have a frankengun on my hands as i honestly was nt looking to buy a gun  just taking it for a debt so i d like to make sure it s around what he owes me the total price he wants for the gun is  600 although regardless of the price  i think i m going to take it because i brought it to the range a few times and it just feels great in my hands ,4618rh,guns,lifestyle,1455604396.0,Dart_Juice,2.0,0.0,19,393,0.0

you ca nt bring your guns into the us to sell  sorry the us has draconian importexport rules  and you d have to get the various permits and pay feestaxes to import those guns for sale they would require a licensed importer to bring them through and mark them with their information  via engraving  electropenciling  etc   the wait timefees associated will completely eclipse whatever you make from selling them not only that  but there s a total import ban on all chinese firearms that are nt  sporting shotguns   so your sks  i m assuming it s a norinco  ca nt come into the country at all  there s also problems with ny you ca nt legally bring in  or even touch  a handgun in ny state if you do nt have an ny pistol permit  which is only issued to residents i lived in syracuse for a couple years and loved going to the syracuse gun show  but that stupid law really annoyed me ny is the only state i know of where someone over 21 literally can not even hold a handgun if they do nt have a permit  as for bringing them to shoot at a local range it s likely more trouble than it s worth again  where canada is pretty lax with bringing guns across the border  the us is  not   you ll need  a permit   https  helpcbpgovappanswersdetaila_id610  bringingafirearmorammunitiontotheusforhunting  2fsportpurposes  from the us atf  declare them at the border  and you ll need to obey state laws i have no idea how long it takes the atf to process that form  but they are not known for their expediency ny has an  assault weapons ban  and a whole bunch of other shitty laws under the umbrella of the  safe act   you ll have to look those up and make sure all your guns comply ,d01esmd,guns,lifestyle,1455588867.0,kefefs,10.0,0.0,6478,4076,0.0

it totally varies by the state state laws run the gamut between totally banning cc on campus and banning colleges from restricting lawful carry  the federal law you re talking about  the  gunfree school zones act   was originally challenged and struck down as being unconstitutional since the federal government has no authority to regulate guns they reintroduced it with language  very loosely  tying it to the commerce clause  which gives the us federal government authority to regulate goods involved in interstate commerce now the language of the law applies to guns that  move in or affect interstate commerce   given how blatant an attempt at skirting the us constitution this gfsza is  it s invoked sparingly the charges brought under it are tied to people who commit other crimes  for example if somebody shoots someone on school property  they might tack a gfsza charge onto the other charges nobody to date has been charged solely with violating the act because the feds know that  if challenged again  it ll be struck down again  so there s that  and also an exemption in the law stating that it does not apply to people who have a state license or permit to possess their firearms the act does nt define which licenses or permits count  so anything from a pistol purchase permit  which some states like mi require to buy a handgun   to an fid or foid  that il and nj require for all gun owners   to a concealed carry license gives the holder exception from the law if you have any sort of license or permit from the state that allows you to have a gun  the gfsza does nt apply to you  so tl  dr anyone with any kind of license is exempt from the federal laws regarding gunfree school zones  and violations of the act are only punished when another crime has been committed,d02gh11,guns,lifestyle,1455661578.0,kefefs,5.0,0.0,6478,4076,0.0

have a ppqm2 in 9mm great gun and fits my medium hand better than my glock 19 or glock 23 one thing to be aware of is that the ppq m2 has a lighter than  normal  trigger for a tactical  carry firearm  ppq m2 is around 23 pounds  and is called something equivalent to  special forces trigger  in germany it is my understanding  correct me if i m wrong  that the german police will not carry the ppq m2 because of its lighter trigger if you are going to use it for your concealed carry gun practice with it a lot to get used to the trigger  for a holster i use a galco iwb that is actually for a glock 192332  royal guard inside the pant holster  gen 2   i like this one because it s horse hide  with the rough side out pistol comes out of the holster easier  use galco silicon treatment on the inside  it takes some work to get it to mold the ppqm2 but it works for me my  02 worth  on the what version question i d go with 300blackoutdrunk and reshp2 suggestions get what ya  ordered already and then just buy a different barrel if  when you want a suppressor ,d01ynki,guns,lifestyle,1455637126.0,Futz69,2.0,0.0,5,766,0.0

i just ordered my first firearm  a walther ppq m2 9mm bought it at gun buyer and i am having a little bit of buyers remorse not because i do nt want the gun  but because i am thinking i should have purchased the m2 navy with the threaded barrel  the navy is only  20 more at  540  which seams like a damn good deal at the moment i do nt have any interest in purchasing a suppressor or getting the stamp at this time  although i would nt rule it out in the distant future  with that being said  i may be interested in using a compensator or some other muzzle device i also figure the navy is a better value at that price those threaded barrels are expensive as hell i just do nt have too much knowledge on muzzle devices and whether i would take advantage  if i change my order i will be charged a 10  cancellation fee   52  which i am willing to eat i do nt mind having to pay that if the navy is the way to go  so my questions are  should i get the ppq navy so i have the option to use a muzzle device or stick with the regular ppq m2  do the different muzzle devices make much of a difference with a 9mm  is it a problem finding a holster for the ppq navy and would it more easily snag  are there any other negatives to ppq navy  i should note the main purpose of this gun is target shooting and home defense also obtaining my carry permit in the near future as well  sorry for my lack of knowledge on the subject and the long post i am still learning and hoping for some opinions from more experienced gun owners whether i would be wise to change my order to the navy edition  edit  consensus says a muzzle device is pointlessstupid on a 9mm i wo nt be suppressing in the immediate future  so i will be staying with original order thanks for the helpful replies ,461war,guns,lifestyle,1455618572.0,Raiders580,8.0,0.0,1,10,0.0

lurker a few months here  but i ve got a puzzler for yall  i inherited a nice old 87a  22 short and long  from my grandad a couple of years ago last year  i finally got around to getting it plunking it was missing the right extractor and spring  but otherwise is in pretty good shape  just some aesthetics  scratches  etc   i ve since taken it to the local old boy shop  who kindly pointed me toward a website from which to obtain said missing parts got em  fitted them  some soft hand filing required   and got her all put back together however  upon firing a single cartridge  the action actually catches the shell before it can escape fully this happens 910 times  with approximately 40 failures to date shells can be sideways  longways  etc i asked the smiths  and they said that it could be anything  as these guns were sometimes iffy  and made by multiple manufacturers over the years my guns are old  but i clean the hell out of them and  lightly  reoil everything before reassembly so  should i buy a bunch of different brands and see what she likes  or is there perhaps some other reason for it  ie i screwed up the right extractor  i was really careful when filing it to fit  and know that it should be slightly tighter and a different shape than the left   tldr  replaced missing extractor and spring old 22 failing to properly extract  catching in slide upon return do i need to try different types of 22  subsonic  hivelocity   i actually have some old short balls around somewhere  thanks guys  edit  i m an idiot guys apparently there s a difference between 22lr and 22 long thanks mastercultet  ,464plc,guns,lifestyle,1455658259.0,Fetal_as_Muck,9.0,0.0,1,143,0.0

you ca nt bring your guns into the us to sell  sorry the us has draconian importexport rules  and you d have to get the various permits and pay feestaxes to import those guns for sale they would require a licensed importer to bring them through and mark them with their information  via engraving  electropenciling  etc   the wait timefees associated will completely eclipse whatever you make from selling them not only that  but there s a total import ban on all chinese firearms that are nt  sporting shotguns   so your sks  i m assuming it s a norinco  ca nt come into the country at all  there s also problems with ny you ca nt legally bring in  or even touch  a handgun in ny state if you do nt have an ny pistol permit  which is only issued to residents i lived in syracuse for a couple years and loved going to the syracuse gun show  but that stupid law really annoyed me ny is the only state i know of where someone over 21 literally can not even hold a handgun if they do nt have a permit  as for bringing them to shoot at a local range it s likely more trouble than it s worth again  where canada is pretty lax with bringing guns across the border  the us is  not   you ll need  a permit   https  helpcbpgovappanswersdetaila_id610  bringingafirearmorammunitiontotheusforhunting  2fsportpurposes  from the us atf  declare them at the border  and you ll need to obey state laws i have no idea how long it takes the atf to process that form  but they are not known for their expediency ny has an  assault weapons ban  and a whole bunch of other shitty laws under the umbrella of the  safe act   you ll have to look those up and make sure all your guns comply ,d01esmd,guns,lifestyle,1455588867.0,kefefs,10.0,0.0,6478,4076,0.0

this is my freshly sbr d cz scorpion evo 3 s1 it s a 9mm parabellum blowback rifle made in the czech republic by cz it started life as a  pistol  and it was trash  if you know only one thing about this gun it needs to be that without a stock it sucks ass but with a stock it s a blast to shoot and will bring a smile to anyone s face i m going to give you my thoughts on it in case you re thinking about getting one  for pros of this gun i d say it feels great in the hands even though it s a little over six pounds  it s a good weight it feels very solid when you re shooting it secondly its pretty accurate i was able to hit the steel plate at 150m with this very easily as long as my hold over was correct this gun is also just fun to shoot  between having very little recoil and slapping the bolt closed on a fresh mag  operating it is just different than a ar15 or ak i also think this gun looks very cool  its different then most other popular guns out right now mags are really pretty cheap  you can get them for  20 a pop which is nice the stock is very solid and works well to really sum up the pros of this gun  its just plain fun  now for the cons  which there are many like i said earlier this gun sucks as a pistol  one of the reasons being the ambi safety it rubs your finger and even breaks the skin after a while when you shoot so i bought the ambi safety delete from cz then there s the trigger  holy shit it s just bad  i really hope someone makes a smooth aftermarket trigger for it i replaced some of the springs to make it lighter  and it s still dog shit and now we get to the rails at the front  they are very uncomfortable to the point where im going to have to buy some rail covers for them  so if you re thinking should i buy this gun  you need to first ask yourself do you want to sbr it if the answer is no then do nt get the cz evo  but if you are willing to get the stock for it it makes a great little rifle that s tons of fun to shoot and is nt like anything else at the range i m not saying its better than the mpx or the ak9 or an ar15 in 9mm or whatever but it is a good gun if your looking for something fun to take to the range   here   http  imgurcomazvmbv  are a couple extra photos i took today ,d02dn22,guns,lifestyle,1455657743.0,vZeppelin,13.0,0.0,3989,3010,0.0

i work at a lgs that is a class 3 dealer one of our post sample guns is a mp5k it recently started having an issue i ca nt seem to figure out about every 3rd round it does not eject the shell casing it extracts it from the chamber but then slams it and the next round up into the chamber area i have thoroughly cleaned it multiple times  i have replaced the main recoil spring i have replaced the extractor and extractor spring the ejector looks good and moves with ease it is nt showing any signs of excessive wear we also have an mp5a2 in the shop and the extractors look pretty damn close without throwing a micrometer on them i am a bit nervous to pull down the trigger group far enough to exchange that on a whim i am hoping you guys may have some ideas or diagnostics i could give a try on a side note  after every cleaning i can usually get one full 30round mag through before failures  thanks in advance for the help,4668nw,guns,lifestyle,1455678971.0,DaEbLe,5.0,0.0,1,29,0.0

hey guys  i m looking to purchase my first shotgun  preferably lt   900   and came across the beretta a300 i ll be shooting skeet with it and possibly waterfowl hunting i ve shot skeet with the a400 excel and loved it  but it s a good bit out of my price range thoughts on the a300 ,460gj8,guns,lifestyle,1455592161.0,Static_Unit,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0
the a300 is a great shotgun it s basically just a bare bones semi auto in that it lacks many of the unique features of the a400 series like kickoff  blink feed  and the aquatech finish  but that should nt really matter i have an a400  and those are all nice  but in the grand scheme of things all your shotgun needs to do is be reliable and be able to perform the functions you need from it the a300 is a quality shotgun at a great price and it will serve you well as a skeet and a waterfowl gun  some other good guns to look at along with the a300 are the benelli montefeltro  franchi affinity  and winchester sx3 those should all be within your price range i say go and hold them all and choose the one that feels the most comfortable to you if i had to pick one it d be a toss up between the a300 and the montefeltro but again  i d go and hold them all and see which gun feels the best to you ,d01hv6q,guns,lifestyle,1455593730.0,Hambs,6.0,0.0,60,88,0.0
do nt be afraid of buying a used shotgun if it is in good condition and from a quality manufacturer you can often buy something that is a lot nicer for the same money  and considering how many shotguns are still out there firing away after over 100 years  a good quality used shotgun will keep going for as long as you need it to with that whole world of shotguns opened up  you can concentrate on finding whatever gun seems to fit you the best the one that just feels right in the hand and on the shoulder there are loads of companies out there that make or have made great shotguns over the years  and people often find that the shotgun that looks so good to them on paper in terms of the features and whatnot just does nt feel good to them when they pick one up  for a shotgun that is mostly going to be used for skeet and waterfowl  you want a gun that will handle at least 3 inch magnum shells  with a longer barrel  28 inches is a good length without being too unwieldy   and one that tends to be heavier rather than lighter a heavier gun will kick less  and if you are shooting skeet or sitting in a duck blind  you are more likely to be shooting it a lot than carrying it around a lot ,d01ilcd,guns,lifestyle,1455594895.0,MerkinInACoalMine,2.0,0.0,49,1904,0.0

i m trying to decide on a first handgun i own rifles and shotguns i have shot a few handguns in my life but never owned one this is a gun that my wife and i would be using for the range and home defense i would also possibly be looking to get my ccw with this gun with these things in mind along with looking and researching i have ruled out both single stacks and full duty size pistols i would like something that is closer to the feel of a full size pistol when shooting but in a slightly more compact package  i know there is no perfect handgun for all of these situations i m simply looking for a nice gun that will be solid all around considering all of the situations i eventually hope to have more options in the safe but for would like this first gun to be an all purpose piece the right choice could be striker fired  dasa or even possibly dao  note  i recently shot a glock 26 and was really not a fan at all it did nt feel great to me and seemed high on recoil or flip maybe a bit of both i m not sure if this was that i could nt get my pinky on the grip or not it was the first pistol i have shot where i could nt get a full grip  with that in mind i have a list of choices i have narrowed down to feel free to let loose with any insight on what i have listed and make recommendations from here or other handguns you think would be better choices my actual experience and hands on is limited so i am going off more research than anything else thanks for any feedbackadvice it is greatly appreciated  fns 9c  two 12 round mags and one with pinky extension plus a full 17 round mag i like that most seem to say it is really easy to shoot due to the heavy slide and low bore axis option of a manual safety sounds like it fits right into what i m looking for  hamp  k p30sk  obviously high quality i also like the idea of a dasa or lem trigger on a first handgun that may be carried my cousin love his also told me he is able to get his pinky on the grip a local shop sometimes carries these for around  550  sig p320csc  the c seems like it may be a little large for what i m looking for but i m not sure at the same time the sc grip may be similar to the g26 that i was nt a fan of i m not sure but if the grip and size are right it looks like a solid candidate it s a striker fired with sig quality after all  sig p250 sc  i m hesitant on dao especially in looking for an all around solid gun however i see a lot of people who say the da trigger on this gun is amazing making it in their mind a perfect choice for carry but also still a blast at the range as i said  hesitant  but intrigued  obviously with the guns i ve listed i m not working on super tight budget at the same time i do consider value  into the equation i m not out to spend  800  1000 if a gun is slightly more expensive but it definitely adds value in the form of quality and options then then i would prefer it at the same time if a gun cost  300 less but is really close to the competition i would have to consider it an example would be the mamp  p 9c i have some experience with it but i feel the fns 9c seems to be a better overall gun that i can get for near the price of the mamp  p this is the reason i did nt list the mamp  p feel free to let me know if you think i m foolish for that line of thinking also feel free to let me know if you think i should go with other models  makes  larger handguns  etc i m 59  180 anything full size seems like it would be too large for conceal in my case  maybe i m wrong   again  thanks for your time ,462lre,guns,lifestyle,1455632051.0,drc003,1.0,0.0,1,312,0.0

if you do nt mind me saying  there is something very important that you are overlooking in your decisionmaking process  you mention in the very first paragraph that this is a pistol for both you and your wife to use  while it is definitely not certain  there is a pretty good chance that your wife has smaller hands than you do if that is the case  she may not be able to confidently and comfortably grip some double stack pistol frames remember that it is always harder to shoot a pistol that is too large for your hand than it is to shoot one that is smaller  your best bet is for the both of you to go to a few gun shops or shows together  and handle all of the various pistols on the market make sure that whatever the two of you pick is something that she feels comfortable with  and is something she likes  and will actively look forward to shooting if you bring home a pistol that doesnt fit her hand very well  she is nt going to want to shoot it  and the pistol you bought for  us  is just a pistol you bought for  you  it does nt matter if the pistol holds 9 or 12 or 15 or 17 rounds  it does nt matter if it is sa or da it is still going to throw lead if it is for home defense  it is way more important that your wife be just as comfortable and competent with whatever the pistol is as you are  and a lot of women have very different criteria and methods of choosing than a lot of men do  you seem to have at least a basic working knowledge of what companies make quality pistols  so as long as whatever the two of you pick is manufactured by one of them  you ll be just fine ,d01xuxb,guns,lifestyle,1455635830.0,MerkinInACoalMine,4.0,0.0,49,1904,0.0
honestly any compact or servicesize pistol will do pretty well the fns 9c is noticeably smaller than the p30sk hamp  k guns are big compared to other guns with the same specs in general lem is dicks  do nt get it  the p320 is nice because it can be adapted to multiple roles  you can get a fullsize and subcompact kit for a compact and have all three options  of your list the p320 c with the small grip is probably your best option have you tried a cz compact ,d0229wn,guns,lifestyle,1455642449.0,SCAxman,2.0,0.0,4446,39346,1.0

an fyi i did nt throw in originally  we have also shot a glock 19 at the range put 100 rounds through it it is definitely a nice hand gun we just did nt necessarily love it or hate it at or around that price point we would like to love it not saying it s not in the running at all it s just on the outside a bit also  if we go striker fire we might like to have a manual safety as an option i understand loads of people love glocks i can see why they are easy shooting guns however it did nt blow us away if you do recommend a g19 i would at least like to hear why you think it is specifically a better option than the others listed if it just happens to be your preference  that did nt really seem to be the case for us thanks ,d01zmhw,guns,lifestyle,1455638627.0,drc003,1.0,0.0,1,312,0.0

do your shells show signs of pressure leaking  look at shells you have fired through it and look for any bulges near the rim that would signify that the action is not locking up tight enough and the shell is not fully supported by the chamber  if so  stop shooting it because you could rupture a case and blow hot gas in your faceyour gun in two piecessomething else you definitely do nt want  if there are no signs of overpressure i probably would not worry shotgun shells are very low pressure  lower than a 22  so it s not as big of a concern as if it were a rifle i would nt shoot any magnum loads though  take my advice at your own peril though  as well as the advice of any other anonymous stranger ,d01fcf7,guns,lifestyle,1455589741.0,flyingchipmunk,2.0,0.0,1863,3345,0.0

this happened to me yesterday me and 2 friends from work had the day off thanks to presidents day  if the usps doesnt run  we dont work  we decided to load up everything we had and head to the private range we use for some exploding targets and skeet shooting as well as general all around fun range time on our way to the range we are stopped by the police  so me and 2 friends decide to go to the range since we had the day off i was nt paying attention and was driving 80ish in a 70 we got pulled over and i handed the police officer my drivers license and chl  he asks me where my handgun is i tell him that one of them is in the center console but we are on the way to the range and have a few more in the car he asks me to show him where the rest are i rolled down my back window showing several rifles propped up against the door kinda straddled by the back of my seat and the back seat  we had 3 mosin nagants  2 sks  4 ar15s  2 hunting rifles  several handguns in the middle in handgun boxes and some in handgun bags also in the back seat was my friend who was sitting in the seat with 4 shotguns straddled between his legs and he had his hands on his head just cause he didnt wan na spook the officer  i mentioned we were on the way to the range and he asked me if there were any more i said yes and popped the trunk he walked back to the back to see our range bags and several gun cases with even more guns  the officer closed my trunk and walked back up to me handing me my license back and told me he was going to just give me a warning for the speeding and walked away it was very obvious he did not want to deal with that situation and all the paperwork and just let us go  outside of the ridiculousness of this situation how do you normally handle a police encounter while you are carrying ,462swz,guns,lifestyle,1455635071.0,texasgunowner12,93.0,0.0,1,72,0.0

i ve been stopped a few times while carrying  in texas it really depends on the town and the cop  once in schulenberg  tx i was doing 60 in a 30  its basically a speedbump town  coming home from college so i had all my guns in the back seat  and a pistol on my hip so i handed over my dl and chl and the cop did nt give a shit about the guns  gave me a warning  small town  be more careful next time  stuff   and i was on my way  then this other time i was going to dallas with a friend to spend easter with his family i got stopped for speeding i was nt carrying  but had a few pistols in a bag since we planned to go to a range handed over dl and chl  and this cop s demeanor turned sour  demanded to know where my gun was  so i told him in the back seat  and he told me to hand it over  so i fished in the bag for the cheapest one  a cz82 and handed it over  it was holstered and had a round chambered so the cop went back to his cruiser with my gun to do his cop thing  and two more cop cars showed up  apparently as backup he gave me my ticket  and my gun  minus the chambered round  cocksucker   and i was off  a few times the cops had been called into my office  and i simply do not inform them i m carrying unless it is somehow relevant ,d022q3n,guns,lifestyle,1455643082.0,rangemaster,8.0,0.0,2463,83456,1.0
ky  so no duty to report  but i do the whole keys out and hands on wheel bit when they walk up and start the encounter i usually tell them then my thinking is that if i get it out of the way first everyone knows the score and there are no surprises cops do nt like surprises it also lets the cop know up front that i m generally not a shit heel since ky runs a background check on me once a month  i got pulled over on the way to work one day and did this song and dance the officer asked me what i carried and when i said it was a sig 226 we talked for 15 minutes because she s one of the last ones on our local force with permission to carry a sig so i got a warning and my 80 dollar permit saved me 150 in court costs ,d023r5j,guns,lifestyle,1455644498.0,GoldFlies,7.0,0.0,62,78,0.0

i just ordered my first firearm  a walther ppq m2 9mm bought it at gun buyer and i am having a little bit of buyers remorse not because i do nt want the gun  but because i am thinking i should have purchased the m2 navy with the threaded barrel  the navy is only  20 more at  540  which seams like a damn good deal at the moment i do nt have any interest in purchasing a suppressor or getting the stamp at this time  although i would nt rule it out in the distant future  with that being said  i may be interested in using a compensator or some other muzzle device i also figure the navy is a better value at that price those threaded barrels are expensive as hell i just do nt have too much knowledge on muzzle devices and whether i would take advantage  if i change my order i will be charged a 10  cancellation fee   52  which i am willing to eat i do nt mind having to pay that if the navy is the way to go  so my questions are  should i get the ppq navy so i have the option to use a muzzle device or stick with the regular ppq m2  do the different muzzle devices make much of a difference with a 9mm  is it a problem finding a holster for the ppq navy and would it more easily snag  are there any other negatives to ppq navy  i should note the main purpose of this gun is target shooting and home defense also obtaining my carry permit in the near future as well  sorry for my lack of knowledge on the subject and the long post i am still learning and hoping for some opinions from more experienced gun owners whether i would be wise to change my order to the navy edition  edit  consensus says a muzzle device is pointlessstupid on a 9mm i wo nt be suppressing in the immediate future  so i will be staying with original order thanks for the helpful replies ,461war,guns,lifestyle,1455618572.0,Raiders580,8.0,0.0,1,10,0.0

have a ppqm2 in 9mm great gun and fits my medium hand better than my glock 19 or glock 23 one thing to be aware of is that the ppq m2 has a lighter than  normal  trigger for a tactical  carry firearm  ppq m2 is around 23 pounds  and is called something equivalent to  special forces trigger  in germany it is my understanding  correct me if i m wrong  that the german police will not carry the ppq m2 because of its lighter trigger if you are going to use it for your concealed carry gun practice with it a lot to get used to the trigger  for a holster i use a galco iwb that is actually for a glock 192332  royal guard inside the pant holster  gen 2   i like this one because it s horse hide  with the rough side out pistol comes out of the holster easier  use galco silicon treatment on the inside  it takes some work to get it to mold the ppqm2 but it works for me my  02 worth  on the what version question i d go with 300blackoutdrunk and reshp2 suggestions get what ya  ordered already and then just buy a different barrel if  when you want a suppressor ,d01ynki,guns,lifestyle,1455637126.0,Futz69,2.0,0.0,5,766,0.0

hey guys  i m looking to purchase my first shotgun  preferably lt   900   and came across the beretta a300 i ll be shooting skeet with it and possibly waterfowl hunting i ve shot skeet with the a400 excel and loved it  but it s a good bit out of my price range thoughts on the a300 ,460gj8,guns,lifestyle,1455592161.0,Static_Unit,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0
the a300 is a great shotgun it s basically just a bare bones semi auto in that it lacks many of the unique features of the a400 series like kickoff  blink feed  and the aquatech finish  but that should nt really matter i have an a400  and those are all nice  but in the grand scheme of things all your shotgun needs to do is be reliable and be able to perform the functions you need from it the a300 is a quality shotgun at a great price and it will serve you well as a skeet and a waterfowl gun  some other good guns to look at along with the a300 are the benelli montefeltro  franchi affinity  and winchester sx3 those should all be within your price range i say go and hold them all and choose the one that feels the most comfortable to you if i had to pick one it d be a toss up between the a300 and the montefeltro but again  i d go and hold them all and see which gun feels the best to you ,d01hv6q,guns,lifestyle,1455593730.0,Hambs,6.0,0.0,60,88,0.0
do nt be afraid of buying a used shotgun if it is in good condition and from a quality manufacturer you can often buy something that is a lot nicer for the same money  and considering how many shotguns are still out there firing away after over 100 years  a good quality used shotgun will keep going for as long as you need it to with that whole world of shotguns opened up  you can concentrate on finding whatever gun seems to fit you the best the one that just feels right in the hand and on the shoulder there are loads of companies out there that make or have made great shotguns over the years  and people often find that the shotgun that looks so good to them on paper in terms of the features and whatnot just does nt feel good to them when they pick one up  for a shotgun that is mostly going to be used for skeet and waterfowl  you want a gun that will handle at least 3 inch magnum shells  with a longer barrel  28 inches is a good length without being too unwieldy   and one that tends to be heavier rather than lighter a heavier gun will kick less  and if you are shooting skeet or sitting in a duck blind  you are more likely to be shooting it a lot than carrying it around a lot ,d01ilcd,guns,lifestyle,1455594895.0,MerkinInACoalMine,2.0,0.0,49,1904,0.0

in my state  pennsylvania   you have no legal obligation to notify the police that you re carrying a firearm it s only suggested that one notify the police if they re going to find out anyway for example  if you happen to have your gun in the glove box  not suggested  but for the purpose of an example  and you need to reach in there for your registrationinsurance paperwork  it would be a good idea to inform the officer beforehand  and also ask how he would like you to proceed also  i suggest avoiding the word gun  say firearm or another term police are trained to react when they hear the word gun  so the overzealous rookie on the passenger side might make a mistake if you say  officer i have a gun   all he s going to hear is  gun    check the laws in your state regarding legal duty to notify police ,d02kiry,guns,lifestyle,1455667781.0,jdgsr,1.0,0.0,1662,945,0.0

they push the weaver hold  which i think is kind of outmoded and hard to do under stress isosceles  damn that s hard to spell  has completely replaced it among successful competition shooters the instructors run a safe line and they can all shoot my brother had a problem shooting his g19  kept jamming and they kept telling him he was limpwristing it he had no problem with the g26 which is much harder to grip  so that was dubious turned out he was riding the slide stop not that uncommon  overall i d give it a b it was a fun experience with my brother they have the cheapest machine gun rentals in the area and the collection includes an m16 and mp5  which jammed  they gave me an extra mag to make it right   they covered malfunction drills and worked up to drawing from holster in what struck me as the  right  progression i think i could do just as well at a couple of places near me  and they do use the lunch breaks to relentlessly pitch you on stuff take a walk ,d026v68,guns,lifestyle,1455648718.0,jimmythegeek1,2.0,0.0,158,10306,0.0

i m trying to decide on a first handgun i own rifles and shotguns i have shot a few handguns in my life but never owned one this is a gun that my wife and i would be using for the range and home defense i would also possibly be looking to get my ccw with this gun with these things in mind along with looking and researching i have ruled out both single stacks and full duty size pistols i would like something that is closer to the feel of a full size pistol when shooting but in a slightly more compact package  i know there is no perfect handgun for all of these situations i m simply looking for a nice gun that will be solid all around considering all of the situations i eventually hope to have more options in the safe but for would like this first gun to be an all purpose piece the right choice could be striker fired  dasa or even possibly dao  note  i recently shot a glock 26 and was really not a fan at all it did nt feel great to me and seemed high on recoil or flip maybe a bit of both i m not sure if this was that i could nt get my pinky on the grip or not it was the first pistol i have shot where i could nt get a full grip  with that in mind i have a list of choices i have narrowed down to feel free to let loose with any insight on what i have listed and make recommendations from here or other handguns you think would be better choices my actual experience and hands on is limited so i am going off more research than anything else thanks for any feedbackadvice it is greatly appreciated  fns 9c  two 12 round mags and one with pinky extension plus a full 17 round mag i like that most seem to say it is really easy to shoot due to the heavy slide and low bore axis option of a manual safety sounds like it fits right into what i m looking for  hamp  k p30sk  obviously high quality i also like the idea of a dasa or lem trigger on a first handgun that may be carried my cousin love his also told me he is able to get his pinky on the grip a local shop sometimes carries these for around  550  sig p320csc  the c seems like it may be a little large for what i m looking for but i m not sure at the same time the sc grip may be similar to the g26 that i was nt a fan of i m not sure but if the grip and size are right it looks like a solid candidate it s a striker fired with sig quality after all  sig p250 sc  i m hesitant on dao especially in looking for an all around solid gun however i see a lot of people who say the da trigger on this gun is amazing making it in their mind a perfect choice for carry but also still a blast at the range as i said  hesitant  but intrigued  obviously with the guns i ve listed i m not working on super tight budget at the same time i do consider value  into the equation i m not out to spend  800  1000 if a gun is slightly more expensive but it definitely adds value in the form of quality and options then then i would prefer it at the same time if a gun cost  300 less but is really close to the competition i would have to consider it an example would be the mamp  p 9c i have some experience with it but i feel the fns 9c seems to be a better overall gun that i can get for near the price of the mamp  p this is the reason i did nt list the mamp  p feel free to let me know if you think i m foolish for that line of thinking also feel free to let me know if you think i should go with other models  makes  larger handguns  etc i m 59  180 anything full size seems like it would be too large for conceal in my case  maybe i m wrong   again  thanks for your time ,462lre,guns,lifestyle,1455632051.0,drc003,1.0,0.0,1,312,0.0

if you do nt mind me saying  there is something very important that you are overlooking in your decisionmaking process  you mention in the very first paragraph that this is a pistol for both you and your wife to use  while it is definitely not certain  there is a pretty good chance that your wife has smaller hands than you do if that is the case  she may not be able to confidently and comfortably grip some double stack pistol frames remember that it is always harder to shoot a pistol that is too large for your hand than it is to shoot one that is smaller  your best bet is for the both of you to go to a few gun shops or shows together  and handle all of the various pistols on the market make sure that whatever the two of you pick is something that she feels comfortable with  and is something she likes  and will actively look forward to shooting if you bring home a pistol that doesnt fit her hand very well  she is nt going to want to shoot it  and the pistol you bought for  us  is just a pistol you bought for  you  it does nt matter if the pistol holds 9 or 12 or 15 or 17 rounds  it does nt matter if it is sa or da it is still going to throw lead if it is for home defense  it is way more important that your wife be just as comfortable and competent with whatever the pistol is as you are  and a lot of women have very different criteria and methods of choosing than a lot of men do  you seem to have at least a basic working knowledge of what companies make quality pistols  so as long as whatever the two of you pick is manufactured by one of them  you ll be just fine ,d01xuxb,guns,lifestyle,1455635830.0,MerkinInACoalMine,4.0,0.0,49,1904,0.0
id personally go with the p30sk  but i think the grip would have the same issue as the g26 as that your pinky wo nt fit i think they make extenders for it  but im not sure  second choice close behind would be the sigp320c because you would be able to get that full grip you wanted i ve never shot the fns  but i ve only heard good things about it  so i would nt say you went wrong picking any of the three  i hate dao triggers ala p250 ,d01w159,guns,lifestyle,1455632466.0,NeverNervous2197,2.0,0.0,46,813,0.0
honestly any compact or servicesize pistol will do pretty well the fns 9c is noticeably smaller than the p30sk hamp  k guns are big compared to other guns with the same specs in general lem is dicks  do nt get it  the p320 is nice because it can be adapted to multiple roles  you can get a fullsize and subcompact kit for a compact and have all three options  of your list the p320 c with the small grip is probably your best option have you tried a cz compact ,d0229wn,guns,lifestyle,1455642449.0,SCAxman,2.0,0.0,4446,39346,1.0

an fyi i did nt throw in originally  we have also shot a glock 19 at the range put 100 rounds through it it is definitely a nice hand gun we just did nt necessarily love it or hate it at or around that price point we would like to love it not saying it s not in the running at all it s just on the outside a bit also  if we go striker fire we might like to have a manual safety as an option i understand loads of people love glocks i can see why they are easy shooting guns however it did nt blow us away if you do recommend a g19 i would at least like to hear why you think it is specifically a better option than the others listed if it just happens to be your preference  that did nt really seem to be the case for us thanks ,d01zmhw,guns,lifestyle,1455638627.0,drc003,1.0,0.0,1,312,0.0

when i walked into one of my favorite gun stores recently  i saw a plethora of new guns in the store then out of the corner of my eye i noticed this gun sitting on a shelf off to the side i ca nt say i have ever seen a rothsteyr m1907 or even any rothsteyr pistol before apart from a  forgotten weapons video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  bautympsh9m  on it so when i went home and did some research  i had to have it besides the fact that these guns are rare  this one in particular has a few interesting extras with it  which i will get to in a little bit  so lets start with the pistol  i have a general idea of how it all works  but i have no god damn idea how they came up with the design  look at this picture   http  wwwhungariaecommanualrothsteyassyjpg    look at it  do you see all that extremely complex machining and how it all fits together  it s a nightmare so i will hold off on taking it apart until i can practice putting a few watches back together as a warmup however what i can see from examing the pistol are a few things for one  it s serial number and acceptance marks put s its manufacture date at 1910  with it being manufactured at   sterreichische waffenfabriksgesellschaft steyr   austrian armament makers steyr company  while others were manufactured at  fegyver  s g  pgy  r budapest   arms and machine factory budapest  these i thought were particularly interesting places of manufacture  because this pistol was made  when austriahungary was still a thing  later on though  after the great war  these pistols were again re issued for various countries in the second world war  with hungary  austria  czechoslovakia and poland all receiving previously issued m1907 s interestingly enough  the italians also fielded these in limited numbers during the second world war as well as part of reparations from the great war  italy was given many of these pistols from austriahungary this pistol was reissued in 1934 to the austrian army because of the  hv 34   heeresverwaltung 34 or army administration  markings on the grip of the gun  next we see the holster  and as bulky as it looks it s actually kind of cool supposedly these can hold 6 loaded stripper clips  each clip holding 10 rounds of 8x19mm roth steyr m1907 ammunition these holsters and pistols were issued to the austrian cavalry as a service pistol as a pistol that would not rely on a hammer fired action that could potentially be fired by the jolting of a horse it fits nicely on a belt and feels solid  much like a p08 holster but slightly longer  last we see the stripper clips  and these are no ordinary clips since this gun contains an internal 10 round magazine  naturally stripper clips are useful in loading the gun effectively and these ones aid in loading the pistol with a thumb assist charger however in this day and age  for some reason these clips are extremely rare and valueable  each clip is worth about  150   http  wwwgunauctioncombuy8892837  and i was lucky enough to buy a gun with four of them  i have yet to shoot this gun  but i am pleasantly surprised to find fiocci still makes this ammo for the mildly painful price of  70 a round  so maybe i ll order a couple boxes before the five other people in the country who shoot these guns buy them ,d01iqv4,guns,lifestyle,1455595149.0,turn_down_for_hwhut,17.0,0.0,4360,3626,0.0

i know the general consensus is that steel cased ammo will not cause wear at a noticeable rate any faster than brass  however  i have personally seen 2 different ar15s have problems with barrel life  one ar started tumbling bullets after about 6k rounds of nothing but steel cased ammo another started doing the same at about 4k rounds of nothing but steel cased ammo both would put sideways holes in paper from as close as 15 yards one claimed his barrel was chrome lined  the other knew his was nt chrome lined for sure  i understand that the case has nothing to do with this  and is a function of the bullet having a copper plated mild steel jacket  both guns were used in competition  so they were used hard  but never magdumped  my personal ars never get steel cased ammo  and one in particular is going on 12k rounds without any problems  is this just coincidence or do steel jacketed bullets really wear the barrels down that much faster ,462guq,guns,lifestyle,1455629915.0,gunnoob1,3.0,0.0,1,2,0.0

 1100 is a decent starting point  remember that accuracy is cheap and quality costs money  everyone will give you their experiences or opinions on their brand you can really be happy with any rifle company that you choose  but some are better than others  i do not like the tikka for short actions  because it is the same size bolt as their long actions  only one bolt size   if you like tikka the best  look at a 300 win  remington has qc issues  but has the most after market parts  so you could replace any of the parts you do not like  savage and ruger are solid options to start a build and many people are happy with them probably the most popular long range on a budget gun is the savage axis  sako is a better quality gun than the others that you have mentioned remember that accuracy is cheap and quality cost money you can get a sub 1 moa cheap rifle  but the money you would spend to upgrade the parts will leave you wondering why you just did nt purchase quality in the first place  there are other costs associated with building a long range rifle  a solid stock can cost up to  1000  chassis   bedding the rifle  200  trigger job  300  optics  2000  bi pod  150  etc,d020o6j,guns,lifestyle,1455640170.0,one8sevenn,2.0,0.0,2520,9693,0.0

i used to own a sig p6 and still own a samp  w m38  both of them are police surplus guns they both look like shit but work fine  which is par for the course for police guns  just make sure that the bore does nt have any pitting  the frame amp  slide do nt have any cracks  and the firing pin is nt broken it s probably fine but you should check anyways you can go through and replace all the springs as cheap insurance but  again  it s probably fine if you do nt  gt  they have a single p226 in 9mm with night sights for  529 that s pretty good  depending on condition and how bright the night sights are every once in a while you can find them for under  500 online  but i think paying  3060 to not have to wait and scour the internet for a deal is worth it ,d01jb8k,guns,lifestyle,1455596098.0,James_Johnson,1.0,0.0,3600,19448,0.0
yes  get the p226 before someone else does assuming the rails are good and everything else checks out the sights are probably used up i have a couple police tradeins and they mostly only have holster and qualifier wear one bad mag from being dropped too many times  you can still pick up a 40 and buy an xchange kit from sig it will run you about what a new sig does but will give you 3 centerfire cartridge options ,d022jzg,guns,lifestyle,1455642843.0,SCAxman,1.0,0.0,4446,39346,1.0
bro  if i were you i would jump on that shit yesterday  for years  i was borderline obsessed with getting my hands on a p226  but could nt find the funds to drop the big dollars for one a couple of years out of college  i caved and got a 2022 in 40 thinking it would be just like a 226  without the price well  i hated that thing and sold it picked up a police trade in g22 for just under  400  i went back and forth on the glock and ended up getting it not one week went by and the same damn shop that sold me the police trade in glock got a clean batch of w german 9mm 226s in from some department on the west side of the state it was heart breaking  about 3 months later  i found a very clean two tone p226r that some guy just decided he did nt like and sold it to a pawn shop i almost bought it  it was  670 out the door  six months later  i was in the same shop and by god s grace  it was still in the case no idea why  it was 95  at least even the employees were baffled that someone had nt grabbed it i had the funds and slapped the bills down  walked out with it that day divine intervention  i swear its the best pistol i ve ever shot and it will never be sold  moral of the story  get that shit now before someone else does i got lucky  but that never happens go get that sig dude its your duty the price is right ,d01kt0k,guns,lifestyle,1455598814.0,northern_yeti,0.0,0.0,510,221,0.0

you do whatever you want to that rifle it is yours it is nt some super rare nazi golden eagle whatever  that is going to be destroyed by cleaning the rust off its a basic  common muzzleloader from tc there is no reason to refinish anything much on that rifle though  it looks like it just needs a bit of elbow grease and flitz on the brass pieces the lock and barrel do nt appear from your pictures to have any rust on them  but if they do  use very fine brass wool  not steel wool  it can strip the finish  and it should be taken care of np the stock  yet again  does nt appear to be beaten badly or have issues with the finish  and if it did it is nt a huge undertaking to refinish a stock  learn how to take care of it with oiling and cleaning  learn how to take it apart and put it together  etc check out rblackpowder for more info and ignore the tards in here telling you not to destroy your priceless ancient relic with standard maintenance  lmfao,d01qq15,guns,lifestyle,1455615646.0,whambulance_man,-2.0,0.0,489,4612,0.0

do your shells show signs of pressure leaking  look at shells you have fired through it and look for any bulges near the rim that would signify that the action is not locking up tight enough and the shell is not fully supported by the chamber  if so  stop shooting it because you could rupture a case and blow hot gas in your faceyour gun in two piecessomething else you definitely do nt want  if there are no signs of overpressure i probably would not worry shotgun shells are very low pressure  lower than a 22  so it s not as big of a concern as if it were a rifle i would nt shoot any magnum loads though  take my advice at your own peril though  as well as the advice of any other anonymous stranger ,d01fcf7,guns,lifestyle,1455589741.0,flyingchipmunk,2.0,0.0,1863,3345,0.0
