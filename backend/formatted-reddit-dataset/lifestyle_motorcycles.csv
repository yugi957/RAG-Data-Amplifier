one of your assumptions is wrong we all like to concentrate on that type of accident where the biker is riding along minding his own business and out of nowhere comes a lunatic in a car who kills him of course that can and does happen  but in  too  many many accidents the biker is partly to blame according to david hough  proficient motorcycling  40  of motorcycle fatalities had a bac of 010  or above in addition  way too many bikers ride way too fast and careless for traffic conditions  you have only to check youtube to verify that there are also too many new bikers and returning bikers who do nt get proper instruction those are the catagories of bikers who are highly represented in the fatality and serious injury columns avoid those things and you have heavily slanted the odds in your favor do nt drink  drug  and ride  do nt ride like an idiot  and get all the instruction and practice you can and you will not guarantee your survival but you can count on it being a pretty unlikely event that might get you ,d02nq01,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672670.0,MoFoFromSLO,2.0,0.0,1,333,0.0

i know that question sounds weird  but i have the same problem every year taxes come around  start getting hyped for the warm months  then the thought starts to cross my mind to finally get a bike i start to plan everything out  take some days off  start getting information from local msf courses  glue my eyes to craigslist  etc and then  like clockwork  some gruesome video or story pops up about some rider getting creamed by a car  no fault of their own  and i immediately rethink the decision just the thought of riding excites me but the fear of getting into an unavoidable accident always drives me away how do i get over this feeling  or what did it take for those in a similar situation ,465ot6,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455671396.0,SenorShakyHands,2.0,0.0,1,34,0.0
the fear or innate feeling of uncertainty is nt something that goes for me do i fear that which i have no control over  sure but it s up to me to be ruled by it or to own it and do with it what i will since in the same vein you have no control over your body  while its not common you could goto sleep tonight and never wake up  brain aneurysm  heart failure  etc the same things that happen on a motorcycle can happen in a car you could get swiped by a kid in his sweet lifted truck and end up 6 feet under  honestly there s no real way to say do this and this and it wo nt bother you in my opinion i would nt want to be oblivious to the dangers being oblivious or ruled by them makes for poor judgement and oftentimes does more damage than understanding and using this fear as motivation to be better  vigilant  perceptive and proactive about your safety  how long it takes you to get to that point is all up to you man  good luck  hope to see you with some wheels soon ,d02na9d,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672019.0,Davewesh,1.0,0.0,129,1662,0.0

so i have a 2000 ninja 500r i got her for  500  but she had been sitting in a garage for  5 years i had the shop run a full inspection and put about  1000 work into her  new tires  brake pads  etc  to get her up and running she had less than 30k km on her  and for a few months everything seemed fine  the first minor issue i noticed was when she had some trouble starting some mornings it d take a few tries  and sometimes you had to wait a few minutes  but i could always get her to start  one time  as well  when trying to start her  there was a loud  pop  sound  immediately followed by her starting i was nt sure what had just happened  so i looked the bike over  eventually figured that it was okay  and rode off  things were fine for a long time after that  at least six or so weeks without an issue then  more recently  she was having trouble starting again then  just a few days before she died  the engine cylinders were making rather loud rattling noises when i was riding i asked a friend what it might be  and he said it was one of the cables riding up against the engine  causing resonance he told me it was no big deal  and if i keep riding it would go away  well a couple days after  and the cylinders were still rattling then  in the middle of the road  the bike just dies on me it felt like a sudden  snap  and suddenly the engine would nt start  or even attempt to start   i thought it might have been the chain coming loose or breaking  but that was not the case  so now the mechanic believes it to be an engine or transmission issue  likely going to cost more than the bike is worth to fix  so she s probably going to be scrapped and sold for parts now instead  anyone have insight into what might have gone wrong  i ll also mention  i had been riding in the rain and harsh weather for most of the past few months i m sure it did nt help  but i m just trying to figure out what went wrong ,464vqi,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455660387.0,theDashRendar,3.0,0.0,9880,84118,1.0

brit here i ride all year in the south of england  with winter trips to the north of england  but not normally scotland in winter   i ve been riding about 36 years  and i can only think of one week where i had to give up and take the bus  although obviously this depends on being somewhere where any snow is either slushy or is ploughed away promptly however snow is not very common these days as compared with 1020 years back generally winter is either cool and wet  or cold and dry decent waterproofs are a requirement  expect to spend about 600  for a good goretex jacket  or about 25x that for top end jacket like rukka   and you might want to look in to getting a heated waistcoat  keis are a reasonable make   i ve not found any boots that i can be sure will last  but i m using dainese trqtour at the moment and they seem to be waterproof and comfortable so far  i would hate to live in provence without access to a bike i sometimes fly down and hire a car to go walking in haut provence  never had time to ride down the scenery can be spectacular i ve generally visited in november due to my working year  and the climate was mild and dry as aix is a bit nearer the sea  i d expect it to be warmer in winter if anything  someone suggested buying a car as a backup that will be expensive just hire a car or a van when you need it  much cheaper ,d02nja9,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672394.0,ctesibius,1.0,0.0,691,57455,1.0

when you say cold weather how cold you you mean  honestly  if you have to ask it s probably not a good idea  like others said  southern europe is ok  italy  spain  greece  parts of france the catch is the alps if you want to go anywhere interesting  sooner or later you re going to cross some mountains and this is not just hard  it s simply impossible the alps in winter are dangerous by car  let alone with a motorcycle  in many countries it s actually illegal to drive without winter tires  ie there is an expectation that at some point the roads will be completely covered in snow  so  if you want to ride  rent a bike in italy or spain and have plenty of fun anywhere else  drive something with winter tires ,d024cur,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455645317.0,rogueman999,1.0,0.0,327,14018,0.0

like others said  it probably valvecam related hard starting can be a sign  at least on single cylinders  of tight valves you could have smashed a valve into the piston  or rattling can be a sign of busted cam chain tensioner  and your cam chain snapped  causing valve into piston carnage could be a lot of bad things  frankly  its time for an engine swap which is actually a very easy process as long as you are careful this can be done with mostly basic tools  patience  and a garage to work in all you need to find is a suitable donor engine   like this   http  wwwebaycomitm0009kawasakininja500rex500enginemotorcompleteheadcrankcase2000141905360607  hash  item210a37f6df  g  3piaaoswb4nwwxvwamp  vxp  mtr  more involved process would be a top end rebuild  pull the valve covers and see what you find before paying a mechanic another dime  oh and do nt listen to your friend anymore  he sounds unhelpful  edit  fyi  engine swap would also replace transmission so technically you do nt need to fully diagnose and pinpoint the issue to get back riding ,d02l06m,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455668531.0,MynameisBubba,2.0,0.0,64,4619,0.0

the xstrikes look quite similar you could order them from revzilla to compare and try them on and return them if you are nt satisfied  i prefer short cuff as well actually just purchased the a  celer and scorpion sgs mk2 last night to compare  waiting on shipment from revzilla  i ve tried the celer on before and really liked it felt almost identical to the dainese air mig the sgs looks like it has a little more functionality  but not sure about the comfort or quality compared to a  and dainese  just two more suggestions for you my budget was  100 but yours seems to be a bit more  and you seem to want to stick with dainese it looks like the xstrike is the evolution of your 07 short tracks  so if i were you i d order it and try it on before looking into other brands ,d02838k,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455650373.0,Vercify,2.0,0.0,73755,7484,0.0

there is nt a whole lot that is going to make the bike a screamer that being said you can swap a gsxr fork up front you can get new rear shocks if you swap out the front fork it will come with a new brake setup which will be nice  however the bike really is nt powerful enough to take advantage of that much stopping power  most of the mods you will do to this bike will be strictly cosmetic if performance is your thing you need to step out of the 70s i own a 78 cb550 and it s annoying but i love it it will never outperform a modern bike though ,d02d6pg,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455657139.0,watch4sharx,2.0,0.0,15,1623,0.0

i am sure a bunch of these get asked and i honestly have tried looking around but nothing ever seemed to answer my question  i am a new rider maybe 150 road miles under my belt so far  yamaha yzfr3 love it  and i have been having the worst time finding the right helmet at first i got a shark speed r seemed to fit nicely until i tried to pull it off my head and it slid down right over my eyes hmm to big but hey it seemed to fit right lets try the next size smaller  then i realized i could easily move it left and right on my head to the point where it felt loose  riding so yup get rid of that  got an arai signet q after that  intermediate oval did nt fit clearly i am a long oval right   well it fits  sort of comfortable to wear does nt move on my head however the sides of my head  upper near the liner  are firmly pushed into the foam and it is painfully unforgiving it also is unnervingly close to my chin i constantly pull the chin forward and my head back and up when i come to a stop  i then did more research and found the shoei rf1200 it feels way more snug then any of the helmets i have tried it does nt feel like my head is against any foam either  however when i try and move the helmet side to side it does  at least the amount it takes the padding to compressed  is there something i am missing  i am thinking the rf1200 is the sweet spot but i am having terrible luck coming up with knowledgeable people  tldr  arai signet q presses the foam into the sides of my head and feels like it needs to be pulled forward and down often  rf1200 feels great and snug but can move side to side  compressing the foam  is any of that normal  also anyone in the central pa area want some free helmets ,466elr,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455681222.0,SoRowdy,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

hey guys  just a quick question here  i have a 1974 kawasaki f11  250 2stroke  enduro bike  have title and lights and everything so i ride it on the road quite often  and i ve been thinking of bringing it back to a  like new  condition but not a restoration to full on original  currently  the fuel tank on it is from an old honda xl 250 from the early 70 s that i rigged up  and there are 2 major problems with the old tank and i want to get rid of it  first problem is it has places where its rotted through and a previous owner stuffed the holes with mighty putty  which is now starting to slowly allow my fuel to evaporate ever so slowly the second problem is that i believe the tank should hold like 15 gallons  but i can only use 1 gallon of it because the way the tank is angled  the petcock doesnt get to the lowest spot on the tank to be able to use all the fuel  i was trying to scout around for some sort of plastic replacement tank that i could possibly paint myself  but i havent found anything yet  and i d rather not spend the  150 on a brand new tank off another bike because i want to give this cool little bike a nice paintjob i already found the text style i m gon na use and the colors  that being said  does anyone know where i can get a plastic or metal tank that fits this thing that isnt original  preferably for around 75100 bucks  i m going to eventually strip it down to bare metal  prime it  and go with my own paint job  and i dont want to destroy a tank that is in original condition just so i can give the bike a visual update from the sore sight it is right now because i think thats unfair to someone that would be restoring one of these machines to original specs  also  i was wondering if anyone could recommend some decent  cheap street and trail tires  preferrably ones that dont cause a lot of fishtail at about 70 mph i have full knobby tires on there right now  and at about 65 mph a decent gust of wind scares the hell out of me going down the road ,4644dp,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455650985.0,Noaht1122,4.0,0.0,1,9,0.0

how i deal in my mind with the risk of riding my motorcycle  november 12  2013 at 3  15pm i m 57  got my first bike at 15 and have had 2or3 bikes my whole life so what have i learned riding a dirtbike where the speed is slower and traction less so the bike is movingsliding around under you does help on the street when you hit spilled fuel sandleaves or if you get on the power to quick and cause a power slide as the bike slides you do nt panic as your instincts take over to let the bike slide and recover not panic and crash by being abrupt on the throttlebrakessteering  develop your skills with your machine   i have ridden with sportbikes since 1981 and seen fast rider s  the one s who survive approach riding quick by investing in training to develop skill before speed  the other end of the spectrum speeds and gambles they will survive to learn skill  kind of like going allin at vegas  lot s crash and burn to die or be horribly crippled  approach riding with the winning mindset of continual training ie  emergency braking and parkinglot circles and figure 8 s so you transition smooth and brake at maximum   recognize the danger points of street riding  left turners  blind spots  intersections use the cars around you as blocker s or pick s by positioning yourself in the safest spot recognize the killpoint where the actions of the car can not be avoided by you  if approaching a leftturning vehicle they suddenly accelerate  are you covering the brake  what is the safe spot you steer to  to survive  have the safe driving strategy running continually in the back of your mind as you ride  for the car s behind me when i come to a stop  i start braking early to close up the distance behind me and get their attention and i can see if their paying attention by how close they come to me i then brake smoothly to a stop with my bike in position 1 slightly angles to the left pointing to go past the car infront of me as my escape route  tire s are your connection to the road  hard tires last long but if they slide they have little grip  softer tires last 5000km but are forgiving as they will pull back underneath you in a slide and better grip in the wet  it s you call  longevity or performance  riding gear is your protection from the road  view it s purchase as you investing in your own safety and future health and comfort the other aspect of good gear is if a situation develops you keep your head up and stay in the fight as opposed to freezing with the thought you are crashing and going to be injured   confidence that you can survive keeps fear from taking over your conscious mind  where i see the difference the right attitude makes is following a experienced rider in traffic versus a new rider  the experienced person is constantly using the traffic around them to optimize their safety in lane position and relative to other cars  while the new rider expects all road user s to respect their right  to be on the road  the technique i often use when avoiding the risk of left turners is to use a vehicle in the inside lane as a blocker but doing so puts me in their blind spot positioned like this hides me from view of the left turner as i am shielded by the car to my left i recognize that if they change to the center lane it will be uncomfortably close but i expect this so i m not upset i m using them  if you hang back 2 4 car lengths you are still hidden from view of the left turner and now if they accelerate their left turn they will hit you greater than 5 car lengths and they should see you and you have distance to brake if you turn infront of you  there are lot s of scenarios in traffic  if you have a close call it s best to analyse and develop a strategy to implement as it s quicker to react than think what your going to do on the spot  how do i view the risk s of street riding  develop riding skill s  practice skills  implement traffic survival strategies  buy tires one level above my normal riding style  buy good protective gear ,d02p915,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455674990.0,GrayMountainRider,1.0,0.0,1,5306,0.0

im assuming you have nt really ridden at all  i say take the msf and see if you like riding or if you just like the idea of riding as far as the concerns of being killed  you have to ask yourself if its worth it for me it s 100  worth the risk  to be able to ride  the feeling is amazing while street riding you can do things that reduce your risks  but even if you take every precaution there is and are super vigilant the risk of another driver  debris on the road  animals  children  and a 100 other thing will never be gone like izoazlion says it s the spectacles that usually make it onto the internet do the msf and see if you want to take riding further then just a dream or if you have a buddy with a bike ask if you car ride it around in a circle in a parking lot ,d02oex2,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455673717.0,Villains_Antagonist,1.0,0.0,1,40,0.0

imo i wouldnt get something much more than 800 bucks you learn a lot off of the older bikes from the 80s from the maintenance of the bike itself to the mechanical workings of the bike i m not saying any of these guys are wrong  and i dont know how much riding experience you actually have  whether you ve ridden dirtbikes and the like i do however know that most people drop their first bike several times  whether it s just rolling out of the garage and you tilt a little too much  to letting the clutch out a little fast showboating in front of the ladies  point i m trying to make is  buy something thats cheap enough you can get it and learn to take care of a motorcycle  and that way when you mess up  you re not out too much cash  an old 80s honda 500650 is plenty of power if you re starting fresh learning how to ride it ll be heavy enough to strengthen your legs and get used to maneuvering around with it  they re relatively cheap  and if you re mechanically inclined  simple to work on not only that  but they can be converted into some bad ass cafe racers worst case scenario you drop it at about 70 miles an hour and destroy the bike  but even then you re only out 5800 bucks and you can buy another bike  parts for those bikes are plenty  and cheap  and even if you completely toast the motor  you can buy another one out of a junk bike someone is parting out for like 150 bucks tops i would nt recommend a 250 ninja for any sort of highway usage at 500cc you should be able to ride comfortably  and relatively fast to get away from people who may try to tailgate you ,d02k5d8,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455667194.0,Noaht1122,2.0,0.0,1,9,0.0

i commuted for more than 10 years with my car  an hour one way and another hour back i tried listening to podcasts or ebooks so that it s not wasted time  but still  it was frustrating i would get to work tired and frustrated and then rinse and repeat when going home  when i initially got my bike it was purely about saving money and i decided that i wo nt be using the highways because filtering was too dangerous  not illegal here  i tried it once and realised that actually it s so much easier filtering on the highway the lanes are wider and everyone is thinking bikes also the traffic only moves in one direction  the cars here in the fast lane sort of keep to the side of their lane so that the bikes can keep moving usually we re a long queue of bikes filtering through the traffic at 45  50 kmh whilst the cars are doing 5  10 kmh  i can drive my 20 km s to work in 30 minutes compared to the car that took an hour plus i get to my destination in a good mood i m never ever going back to a car actually  i suspect my cars battery is dead again i have to try and remember to drive it somewhere at least once a month  tldr  the camaraderie between the bikes and the thoughtfulness of most car drivers are awesome and i m never going back to a car  edit because i suck at proofreading ,d01qksa,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455615051.0,ialsodontcare,3.0,0.0,1,379,0.0

top 5 new riders skills we say over and over september 17  2012 at 2  18pm this year we have seen some very new rider s advance their skills quickly  i feel in part by being shown the basic skills of road riding and being part of the rides where the conversation is about the finer points the information is easier to relate to  understand and remember we are not talking trail braking  backing it in or wheelies  we stay with the basic top 5 skill s that we see new riders need to have  no1 maintain a comfortable level of focus  no day dreaming   no death grip on the bar s  keep your arms relaxed  support your weight with your core not your hands light but firm grip so you feel the steering input and feedback without transferring all motion into your neck and head  this increases you endurance by not fatiguing any one part of your body  no2understand where the corner starts  keep your head up and aim to ride a smooth curve through the whole corner  think of it as distributing the turning stress on the tire s over the entire corner  maintaining your lane position as you look where you want to go your peripheral vision is what you use to check your lane position  no3in a corner look 2 meters to the inside of the rider infront of you so you maintain a awareness of the whole corner and your line and not use  the rider infront as a reference point if they drive off the road you do nt want to follow  no4no braking in corners  set your speed before the corner  ride the first half steady then a little throttle for the second half as you exit your tires do 1  thing at a time well  braking to much while leaned over will result in a crash  to much front brake will have the front washing out and toss you infront of the bike if the rear brake breaks the rear tire loose the rear of the bike will come around as a lowside also if you let off the rear brake when the back is hung out before the bike is on it s side  the tire can grab and launch you into a deadly highsideup over top of the bike  no5do nt chase after or push yourself to keep up to anyone  no running redlights  no cutting off cars to stay with a group  when passing a car wait till you see it  in your mirror then signal  shoulder check and move over know where the ride is going so if there is no sweeper you can meetup at your own pace  a common accident starts with a new rider falling back on a series of corners  then going fast on a straight stretch to catch up  they missjudge the cornerstart and entry speed they try to make a abrupt correction  brake or lean   realize they are in danger  target fixate  on a carrockditchconcrete barricade and crash right into the hazard they should avoid  in closing it is reasonable as a new rider to request 1 person stay with you  if you feel riding alone at night on a curvy road will stress you to a point where your abilities to ride your bike will be affected  if noone in the group is considerate of you personal safety  you are riding with the wrong people  ride at your own pace so you do nt crash or have almost crash s  after a ride  debrief your ride and think about what went right and what went wrong  what would you do different in a similar situation  it s easier to implement a preplanned strategy as opposed to thinking on the spot  what you should do rarely honking your horn helps  in the moment the car will not react quick enough and your time would be better used to react than signal your displeasure ,d02oywu,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455674561.0,GrayMountainRider,1.0,0.0,1,5306,0.0

hey guys  i had a relatively scary moment yesterday at a 150kph  that s 93 freedom units per hour  curve    issue   i was leaning over when i hit a very mild undulation on the road the handlebar started a very low speed  low displacement  i m thinking 5  at maybe 2hz  wobble that straightened itself after a few wobbles  obviously that scared the shit out of me and took out a lot of confidence    potential problems   i ve searched around and from what i see  this is usually caused by low tyre pressures  i m running them 38psi frontrear   worn out tyres or dodgy steerer tube bearings  the likelihood of having bad steerer bearings is low  though not ruled out  as my bike is slightly over a month old tyres are in good condition  which leaves me to possibly the suspension  since i m 66kg  145 lbs  i ve reduced my rear preload  front is nonadjustable  almost to its minimum  and the shock has been adjusted accordingly the adjustment of preload was done by feel  as i did not have anyone around to help with the sag measurement  i feel comfortable going through bumps but to date have not determined its effect on the bike s handling on the more extreme ends my limited testing to date has revealed no front wobbling under hard acceleration out of corners  but of course this does nt mean the setting is ideal    what can i do    my question is  what can i do  in increasing order of costs  to address this issue  its not something i d really like to experience again so experimenting with it is not really a path i want to take  would increasing my preload help address this  when i first got my bike  preload was set about 50   as opposed to the  10  right now  through the rear shock and i did nt feel comfortable going through a corner with the handlebars appearing to wobble quite a bit  more so than what it does now  bike is an aprilia shiver 750 from what i understand  it has a fairly decent chassis but is lacking in the forks  thanks guys ,4662bv,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455676561.0,tanyeehou87,1.0,0.0,168,1670,0.0

so typically this is called rowing and it s common when the fork rebound or compression is to slowsoft but can be caused by other things setting sag by feel is not a very good idea unless you know what your doing  your best bet is to properly set sag  i would recommend finding a race shop that offers suspension tuning and have them set your bike up it will make a world of a difference and you will have much more confidence in your ride  http  wwwsportridercomsuspensiontuningguidesuspensiontroubleshootingsymptoms edit  tire pressures should nt have too much of an effect on this if they are in the ball park 38 psi is much to high for sport riding let alone high lean angles at high speeds however what s your hot temperature  cold temps are meaningless ,d02ulgf,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455683808.0,tottenham12712,1.0,0.0,998,2675,0.0

i have a contour roam 2 and for my own riding habits i found it very good it s a very slim profile that fits on the side of the helmet so it does nt stick out this was a big win for me as i did nt want something on the top or chin of my helmet  i run it in 1080p 30fps mode and it s really good for daytime riding but it certainly falls short during the night i have not owned any other action camera but the contour at night really only captures lights and nothing more it s very  very dark  there are some niggles such as no ondevice preview  poor software  and no way to change the settings on the fly  it s all done in the software while plugged in   but for a fire and forget camera that can record up to 253 hours footage it s very good the other nice feature is that it s fully waterproof without a case so you can keep that slender camera without a bulky case over the top  i have heard you can get the contour roam 1 and flash the contour roam 2 hardware so it s pretty much the same  if this died i d probably look into a gopro for the crisp quality gains  work out how to mount it  decide there is no easyclean way  and pick up another roam ,d01ue6r,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455628789.0,alfiebear,1.0,0.0,1,62,0.0

one of 2 likely possibilities  1  the battery is bad 2  there is some electrical component that you are leaving energized while your bike sits and it is killing the battery  if this is a brand new bike  a bad battery should be covered under warranty other possibilities include a faulty charging system or a short  both which should be covered under warranty ,d01vd0k,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455631059.0,jmd_forest,3.0,0.0,1,14686,0.0

easiest and cheapest solution is not be at high lean angle at 150 clicks   sounds like normal behaviour for suspension at high lean if you are nice and loose on the bars it will wiggle and deal with it  good body position might help and also getting sagreboundcompression right on the front end not sure how adjustable a shiver is though  also thinking about it  38 psi  assuming measured cold  is way too high on the front for that kind of pace it could be stopping the tyre flex to absorb some of the bump what tyres are you running ,d02twjc,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455682574.0,opticalminefield,1.0,0.0,101,1014,0.0

from the time i bought my first bike to the time i was on the street was minutes as i already had taken a course that prepared me to ride a motorcycle on the street  the course consisted of 2 evenings in the classroom followed by a day and half in the parking lot and a short road ride then two more long evening rides after that i took my road test and got my license i had never really ridden a motorcycle before this  at the end of the course it was plenty exciting being in traffic but i did nt feel so afraid as to not want to ride on the road looking back i was pretty wobbly  but you have to start somewhere  take it slow and go at your own pace its not a contest choose when and where you ride to minimize risk i still avoid rush hour riding as i do nt like dealing with the aggression ride your own ride is probably the best advice i have received i have nt always followed it but i certainly do now never try to keep up with a group or ride a road you do nt want to ride or in conditions you do nt want to be in  i still go to the parking lot occasionally to hone my slow speed i try to take some training every year last year i did a slow speed technical course put on by the police in the fall i went to a winter riding refresher course often these events are free  riding a motorcycle is a skill  like playing the piano  there will always be people better than you at it its a self improvement game  sorry for the wall of text ,d022q7a,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455643086.0,lgop,1.0,0.0,19,2249,0.0

hey guys either something is wrong with me or my bike i just bough a 98 zx6r and have been so excited to ride it the rain finally stopped so i decided to take it out and i got ta say it sucked i m coming from a dual sport and this is the first sport bike i ve ridden i m not sure how your even supposed to sit on the thing i try bending my arms and squeezing the tank with my legs but that just hurts my knees and i have a hard time keeping my foot over the rear brake it does nt feel right i m terrified going around turns and the bike seems to wobble at times i feel like i m going to crash i feel like shit what am i doing wrong  edit  fuck ,464lah,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455656756.0,2strokeflyer,4.0,0.0,1,14,0.0
you support yourself with your feet  not your arms i only squeeze the tank under hard braking  you do nt cover the rear brake  or even use it for that matter only on poor surfaces like gravel or grass keep the balls of your feet on the pegs as for cornering  i d have to see what you re doing sportbikes suck around town and at low speeds  period they re made for going fast and taking high speed turns  not putting around in traffic that may just be your problem ,d02jkdk,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455666190.0,spongebob_meth,3.0,0.0,175,37738,0.0
i used to ride dual sports  drz400  wr250x  and currently have an 899 panigale it s definitely a different experience but if you re willing to adapt and learn a new philosophy then you may just love it a sport bike does nt have the height of a ds and the balance is totally different with a ds your waist is like a joint between the man and the machine  it pivots and moves often counter to the bike part of this is low speed handling dynamics a sport bike is meant to do three things  go like hell  stop like hell and teach you gyroscopic physics while turning  you may need to change your approach to this bike it s all about weighting the front or rear tire as necessary and playing q game of chicken in the turns when you re accelerating keep your balls on the tank and your face in the fairing when you re slowing put your ass on the pillion and use your thighs and abdominal muscles to keep your shoulders perpendicular to the ground when turning use the outside thigh as a primary connection to the bike as best as possible keep your wrists light and feathery  riding a sport bike is a discipline  like yoga it can in a certain sense be relaxing but it can also be physically demanding if you re looking for a leisurely stroll you came for the wrong place ,d02kkb2,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455667845.0,from_dust,3.0,0.0,9291,73906,1.0
some random thoughtsideas  how tall are you  the ergos on sportbikes are nt good for 61 riders  whereas dual sports are nt great for short riders you could get handlebar risers to get your positioning a little more erect  as for the foot on the rear brake  you could get a new rearset that s adjustable  that could let you tailor your foot position you may be able to bendreplace the brake lever to get it lower so you do nt strain your shin muscles trying to cover it  also  look into techspec grips to help reduce the pressure you need to exert on the tank with your knees in order to hold yourself up  i used shove my crotch right up against the tank of my sportbikes to give my back better leverage in holding myself upright as you press against the tank  rolling your hips forward pushes your stomachgroin into the tank  straightening your back into a more ergonomic position ,d02dr2v,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455657897.0,CG_Ops,2.0,0.0,4670,5570,0.0

the bike feels unstable because it  is  less stable due to more aggressive steering geometry  supersports are twitchy minor steering inputs are then amplified by the narrow bars  and  due to it being a new bike to you  you are likely giving all kinds of minor inputs just riding that will reduce as your strength and skill grow  as for the rear brake  if you ca nt get to it  adjust it so it s at a better angle just recognize that the rear brake on a supersport does nt provide a lot of value outside midcorner speed corrections and downhill corners  and  wheelie control     you do nt want it to be easy to stomp on because you  will  lock it up  you ll have fun it s just growing pains  ,d02tkw5,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455682007.0,SoftwareMaven,1.0,0.0,189,6814,0.0

check the carb balancing ports  small brass tubes   see if the rubber plugs are cracked or popped off this used to happen to me so often i carried them on the bike but  lack of charge means bad stator or rectifier take off the stator housing  a burnt stator is obvious if the stator looks ok  check the voltage on revving  if it does nt go up  the rectifier is pooched ,d02hhgg,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455663029.0,Professorbubba,1.0,0.0,821,11995,0.0

if the engine turns over via starter  i would not suspect the charging system and would instead suspect a fueling issue  though it is possible it sounds like you ran out of gas or left the petcock turned off  to rule out the charging system  follow  this chart   electrosportcommediapdffaultfindingdiagrampdf  starting with fully charging and load testing the battery  your local auto parts store can do this for you do nt rely on the word of others or hunches  this will tell you the exact culprit if any exists in the charging system  its rather easy to test with complete accuracy using a basic mulitmeter  as for the fueling  check the fuel level in the tank  fuel flow out of the tank  then carb fuel level  float ,d02mext,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455670667.0,BeerWrench,1.0,0.0,971,3480,0.0

so presently i m riding at the track only for me  a lot of it was logistics i presently have a little one and the notion of just hopping on a bike for a ride and that schedule  were just not working in my brain even the notion of planning out a weekend ride just does nt seem right in my head for whatever  strange  reason  planning out a track day does work in my addled brain i ca nt really explain why but the ability to point to a calendar  months in advance and say  that day   jives better i wo nt say it really makes sense that s just how it is  i also got a remote job that i can do anyplace so i wfh most often i d been commuting on the bike but going to the garage and making vroom vroom noises before pulling out my laptop to work is nt exactly riding so presently i m sans street bike  for a track ride  personally i d say  why bother with a liter   there s plenty of good 600ish cc bikes that ll cost less to purchase  cost less to keep running and shod in tires and are  plenty  fast with a capable rider at the controls ,d01vkn5,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455631519.0,SlidePanda,4.0,0.0,357,14217,0.0

it depends on what you are into anything can be dangerous or safe  it all depends on how much attention and effort you are putting into it  for example  i know a couple of guys that are into modding their bikes for power and doing roll ons  and they will meticulously check tire pressure  replace wheel bearings  check their forks  safety wire fairings  and only go out late at night at like 34 am to do pulls on the highways always full leathers  always scouting runs  likewise  i know guys that commute most year around on their bmw adventure bikes  and they are very aware of things like slowing down for intersections  staying away from cars  and general street strategy  the guys that end up getting hurt or killed are the ones that approach riding without much thought  whether on the street or on the track  or in the woods on dirt bikes  just be aware that going fast on the track takes a bit of investment in both time and finances it takes a good amount of training to go fast around corners  as well as money for things like good tires  and other bike specific things likewise  unless you are on a separate track bike  you will always be holding back and not developing as much skill as you should because you wo nt want to wreck it and because that bike wo nt be street legal  you need some way to transport the bike  and generally  riding to the track is a bad idea  ,d020srv,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455640354.0,skillsxr600,1.0,0.0,139,4224,0.0

you do nt mention which country you are in  and it makes a big difference i m in the uk  and ride street  some track  and a fair amount of trail where i am  street riding is quite safe providing that you have training above the elementary level  i d class msf as elementary as it is only slightly above the cbt required for beginners in the uk  and well below the standard required to qualify for a full licence   safety depends much more on your own training and ability than on other drivers  because you can reduce the risk from other drivers quite substantially  track will depend on which track  and on the aggression of other riders unlike a road environment  you probably wo nt even see the person who overcooks a corner and torpedos you from behind  so your own skill wo nt reduce risk much where i generally ride  the other riders are usually ok however i have a friend who reports that he s seen 13 of the bikes on a different track crash  usually through being too aggressive it might be a good idea to watch a track day or two at the courses you are interested in for me  i d say that track is an acceptable risk  but more dangerous than street by quite a way  you did nt mention trail  but for completeness i d say that this is more dangerous than either of the others falls are at lower speed  but are harder and much more frequent i last had a fall on the road about 16 years back  but i go down once or twice a day off road  usually because of ruts most of the people in my club seem to have had broken bones ,d02o2k1,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455673200.0,ctesibius,1.0,0.0,691,57455,1.0
it s not really common for people to only want to ride on a track but people do exist some racers in interviews say they do nt ride on the streets any more but others do  i think it really depends entirely on what you look to get out of biking and if your main love is the going fast and hitting corners just right  perfecting your downshifts heading round a tricky bend etc then certainly i can see why you d want to run track  road riding and track riding are totally different styles and have totally different  stimuli  if you get my meaning  nothing wrong with only doing one and not the other  it s preference is nt it  it s like the guys who basically only do offroading  preference for them ,d01rirr,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455618987.0,Megaross,1.0,0.0,936,363754,0.0

i have a contour roam 2 and for my own riding habits i found it very good it s a very slim profile that fits on the side of the helmet so it does nt stick out this was a big win for me as i did nt want something on the top or chin of my helmet  i run it in 1080p 30fps mode and it s really good for daytime riding but it certainly falls short during the night i have not owned any other action camera but the contour at night really only captures lights and nothing more it s very  very dark  there are some niggles such as no ondevice preview  poor software  and no way to change the settings on the fly  it s all done in the software while plugged in   but for a fire and forget camera that can record up to 253 hours footage it s very good the other nice feature is that it s fully waterproof without a case so you can keep that slender camera without a bulky case over the top  i have heard you can get the contour roam 1 and flash the contour roam 2 hardware so it s pretty much the same  if this died i d probably look into a gopro for the crisp quality gains  work out how to mount it  decide there is no easyclean way  and pick up another roam ,d01ue6r,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455628789.0,alfiebear,1.0,0.0,1,62,0.0
