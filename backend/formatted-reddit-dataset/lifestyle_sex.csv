last i was talking to people that did it  chaturbate was the best for couples  income varies greatly based on time on screen  the flow of users  time of day and year  etc generally  unless you do it as a full time job  you re not going to be able to pay the bills doing it you can generate enough to supplement things nicely though low end that i ve heard equals out to three or four bucks an hour high end can equate to thirty plus  if you re doing it for fun that you get paid for  there s nothing to lose  but be aware that once it s on the internet  it s there pretty much forever you can guarantee that eventually someone will capture the stream and spread iti knew a couple that wore masks on cam  sometimes costumes as well  overall  it s a difficult field to turn into regular  reliable income  but it can be great for extra pocket money,d01imzf,sex,lifestyle,1455594971.0,southsamurai,8.0,0.0,20,8749,0.0

my  22f  boyfriend  23m  of 7 months got the results of his most recent lab work today and found out that he has hsv1 based on my last testing  done in december of last year  i don  t have it  but i do plan on getting testing again soon despite me telling him that it  s very common and that the symptoms are not always severe  he believes that his life is over as he knows it he feels that he  ll never be able to have a regular relationship  get married  have kids  etc many of the things he wanted to do prior to receiving the diagnosis  i am still interested in being with him  but he  s really worried about transmitting it to me i told him that it  s still possible to engage in activities with the diagnosis and that just because one partner has it  the other one is not guaranteed to get it and maybe this sounds na  ve  but even if i were to get it  in my opinion herpes is basically a skin condition that may or may not flare up that is usually otherwise benign in other words  though i would not like to not get it  it would not be the end of the world if i did also  because it is so common  i feel like even if i don  t get it from him  there  s a fair chance that i could get it in the future  am i being na  ve  is he being overly dramatic  or is it a combination of the two  what should i tell him  also  he plans to get retested and i plan to get tested again this week  edit 1  he was diagnosed via blood test for igg antibodies tl  dr boyfriend recently diagnosed with hsv1  feels life is over,465fqv,sex,lifestyle,1455667737.0,ilikepretezels,0.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

i m a pretty ugly guy  there is very little about my face or body that would be considered attractive i know attraction is subjective  but i highly doubt any woman would consider me a 7 or above i imagine the subjectivity of attraction means i range from 25  maybe a 6 if i m particularly witty that day and i m not saying i only want supermodels  but i do want women i m attracted to given that there is nothing physically attractive about me  going for women who have attractive features means i m batting out of my league  it s well understood by almost everyone that attraction is an important part of a relationship  and pretty much the only factor in a hookup or fuck buddy situation nobody wants a relationship without attraction  that s just a friendship but when it comes to ugly people  apparently this does nt apply i m told to lower my standards  and take what i can get i should be grateful for unfulfilling sex with women i m not attracted to if i want a one night stand  it has to be with a woman as ugly as me  which is nt very tempting if i want a relationship  i m supposed to look past the physical and see the inner beauty  even though no woman with options would ever do that for me  i see a lot of unattractive couples  but honestly i think they re with each other because that s all they can get  and they both know it there s no passion  no attraction  no lust it s just that or dying alone you can call me shallow  but how many of you would date someone you were nt attracted to  i ve never felt passion  chemistry or mutual attraction i ve never been desired or lusted after if good looking women are nt attracted to me  why would an unattractive woman fancy me  the answer is they would nt  they d be settling for me just like i d be settling for them  and the relationship would be a sexless  passionless sham  is there any hope for people like me  am i making sense  or is this all just depressive bullshit  if so  why  tldri feel like i ll never have a good sexual relationship because the women i want are nt attracted to me  and the women i could get would just be settling for me  and i d be settling for them ,464q93,sex,lifestyle,1455658500.0,EverytingsShinyCaptn,2.0,0.0,1,249,0.0

a thread here got me thinking about something i just realized i ve never thought to ask before when my wife and i have piv sex  we do the usual inoutinout about a quarter of the time  and the other 34 we grind against each other s pelvises  for her the grinding simulates her clit and deepspot  for me it s twofold it feels like she s either milking me or gnashing the tip of my penis hard against the end of her vagina now  that second sensation is only possible because my cock is slightly longer than her pussy is deep there s about a quarter of an inch of shaft that either does nt go in  or if it does  it s because my penis is slightly bent inside her if she was half an inch deeper  this sensation would be completely gone  i know because i ve had exes that were deeper  now  on to my question when you  or your partner  grinds is there a sense of  completeness   for lack of better terms  if the penis is slightly larger than what the vagina can fully engulf  or conversely  is there a sense of lacking if the opposite were the case ,464l4y,sex,lifestyle,1455656698.0,WayneCider,1.0,0.0,1,553,0.0

one way to start is with massage my gf really likes being touched  both in a relaxing and in a  get in the mood  kind of way it s a nice  slow  affectionate way to get her naked and put my hands all over her then eventually i m kissing my way down her spine and she s wiggling her hips toward the edge of the bed and things heat up from there  one way to finish is with a leisurely  round 2   after a nice hard fuck i ll need a minute  or two  to catch my breath  kiss and cuddle and while i m not always physically capable of repeating an  a  game of vigorous sexual athleticism  sometimes it s nice to just roll over into the spooning position and reenter my partner it s not about chasing another orgasm  well  not to begin with anyway   it s just about the wonderful feeling of holding her tightly as our hips rock together  joining our bodies as deeply as possible while i kiss her neck and tell her how wild she drives me  i mean it  is  sex  and it usually leads to more sex and more orgasms but it does nt have to  and it s not the sort of thing you need to warm up with stretches for ,d02jt0i,sex,lifestyle,1455666633.0,greedymage,11.0,0.0,1,86,0.0
me and my girl kind of have a similar issue she s very into just getting fucked  the more control i take and the more i basically use her sexually the better for her most of the time she likes it rough and manhandley  sometimes though we like to get more lovey and passionate it does nt happen often but when it does its always spur of the moment the other day we were visiting my parents and we were getting a little freaky at night time started having fairly hot sex but it was getting a bit loud cuz of body contact and bed and we heard the bathroom door down the hall close and she hopped off immediately kind of panicked and we got under the covers but we were both still turned on and she reached back and guided me in  so we start having sex spooning and i do nt know what it was but man did that heat up  we were grinding into each other and grabbing each other like we ve never done before she could nt keep in her moans and pulled my hand up to cover her mouth we were biting and clawing at each other it was so hot we were moving together so well omg best sex in a loooong time  anyway just let it happen but just do positions that enhance intimacy spooning works well for us ,d02n9m2,sex,lifestyle,1455671993.0,a_friendly,4.0,0.0,31,1978,0.0
so i know this kinda fits into the  orgasm troubles  bit in the faq but it s different hear me out  i m in my early 20s  have been masturbating since before i started kindergarden  not that i knew what it was  and apparently doing it wrong or so i m led to believe at the moment  there s a very specific position for me to be in  a very specific amount of pressure to apply to a very specific area and a very specific motion i also like visualising myself in situations that i could nt be in in real life now  do nt get me wrong  this is quite useful because i can get myself off from no arousal in about 2 minutes by myself  the problem is  i have a partner now i have no insecurities  except for fear that i will take too long  or spectatoring issues with him there s plenty of foreplay and we re pretty open so i do tell him what i like etc and he puts a great deal of effort and time into helping me but in the end i always have to revert to my own way  which is also quite  closed  to his further participation due to the position  and by then i feel horrible about how i could nt orgasm   and also feel bad about the visualisation because it feels like i want to cheat on him if that makes sense   so it takes a while for me too i can tell he feels awful about this  i tried masturbating in other ways but when i m not paying attention i find that i always revert to my own movement so that did nt work i also tried not masturbating for a long time before one of our sessions and that did nt help either  what do    tldr  girl has been masturbating the same way for the longest time  nothing else gets her off thus having issues with boyfriend  needs help fixing them  ,463zmb,sex,lifestyle,1455649373.0,throw_away_089,10.0,0.0,1,7,0.0

hey  all i ve posted several times in here with questions about my inability to orgasm  and each time  you ve all been very helpful  i m at the point where i m sensitive every time we have sex piv penetration always feels  great   if he starts rubbing my clit during penetration  even better  because my legships start shaking 80  of the time i m getting really wet  i m really happy  i m super turned on and loving every second of it  so where s the orgasm  i ve been told to try fantasizing during sex  but that does nt really work for me i ve tried  and i always wind up wondering what it is exactly i should be thinking about  which takes me away from the moment  which is the opposite of what i need to come  my so helped me learn how to grind to hit my gspot while i m on top  and that always feels awesome  but i think when it starts to feel too good i ca nt keep going with the same intensity  which means i ca nt get there it s like i get too weak or something i m not sure how it happens  when i was asking him about my gspot  lol  bizarre  right   he suggested i explore down there by myself  but i do nt know what to do i ve tried masturbation in the past and it s always boring and does nt feel good it does nt feel bad  but it feels like nothing i guess i just ca nt get turned on enough by myself  even with the help of porn or erotica or anything like that  suggestions ,465h69,sex,lifestyle,1455668312.0,kiwichampion,1.0,0.0,1,690,0.0

this is totally uncharted waters for me even though i m female  i used to have somewhat of a male thought process in regards to lingerie  what s the point  what s wrong with going straight to naked   ha however  i tried it once for my so recently and found that i got a lot more enjoyment from it than i thought i would i felt super sexy all dolled up and loved the reaction  the only thing i struggled with was the  for lack of a better term  presentation we live together  so it s a little hard to keep the mystery what s your favorite way to show your partner you re wearing something sexy  do you excuse yourself to put it on  is it always a surprise  or do you tell them  if you re the recipient  what s your favorite way to find out your partner is wearing linergie  halp  i need pointers ,463sxn,sex,lifestyle,1455647174.0,YeahHowAboutNo12,44.0,0.0,1,1,0.0

sounds like you re not using it right if she s not really aroused or the vibration is too pinpointed on one spot a lot of times i get that tickled feeling too you need to let her use the vibrator on her own to figure out exactly what she likes  probably in private  without you  and then she can show you for me its a combo of making little circle motions around my clit area with my legs kinda spaced apart pressing down on one spot or just shoving it down her pants is nt going to do much a lot of times if you re not doing it right it either tickles like crazy or if its directly on the clit it can be somewhat painful so just be careful if you re doing it to her let her completely figure it out and then show you my bf puts me on my stomach  ass up  and sits in between my legs and plays with it like that and it drives me to orgasm almost every single time figure out what she likes and do nt be afraid to try every single position  sometimes that detail is all it takes ,d02v7lz,sex,lifestyle,1455684960.0,sctaco,1.0,0.0,11467,88,0.0

hi all  i m a teen guy  16  who might have sex with my girlfriend in a few months i m uncircumcised  so i m not sure how sex works with that i m assuming that  as i ll be hard  i ll just do it with my foreskin back the whole time so it s my bare head in continuous contact  obviously it s pretty sensitive since i m uncut  but i m assuming the inside of a vagina is wet and soft enough to be comfortable  or no  i ll also obviously be using a condom if i end up doing it  so how will this make it harder  thank you so much in advance ,461y80,sex,lifestyle,1455619681.0,throwawaysex2k16,5.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
not being circumcised is the norm in a hell of a lot of places  and it s the natural state of a penis sex is nt any more difficult with a foreskin  in fact it s probably easier since there is less of a necessity for lube  your foreskin will move just like it does when you masturbate it slides up and down practice putting a condom on a few times and masturbating before you are planning to have sex so you can figure out how to do it properly and comfortably  the inside of a vagina is wet and soft  unlike your hand the sensitivity you feel is a good thing  though the sensations of sex can be a little weird the first time since you think a lot about what you re meant to be doing and feeling try to relax  you have nothing to worry about  and remember that everyone was inexperienced at some point but you will work it out with time and practice  the faq is a great thing to read  so i would recommend you take a look happy sexhaving ,d023g7k,sex,lifestyle,1455644075.0,such_a_sin,4.0,0.0,1,14711,0.0

it works the same way for circumcised and uncircumcised the foreskin naturally rolls back as you thrust in and exposes the head for all that nice vagina kissing  when wearing a condom  you have your hard cock as normal  pinch the top of the condom  place it on the top of your penis and roll down you should have a good bit of excess condom at the top to catch cum and what not as you move in and out with the condom on  your foreskin will naturally move a bit  but it all works the same 8090  of the work is not circumcised  so it is pretty normal  ,d0280dr,sex,lifestyle,1455650265.0,Chubguyv1980,2.0,0.0,1,72,0.0

soo  first of all  srry for my shit english back to the topic  i love giving oral sex to my girlfriend buuut  i ca nt make her cum we have sex almost every weekend when she comes to my place and viceversa and we ve been together for about 6 months now and this thing frustrates me because i m not the only one in this relationship and i want to make she feel good yes  she really enjoys sex  but i ca nt make she cum i did it one time  she cummed twice  but only then the idea is that she is saying oral sex is tormenting her and it does nt seems to be so enjoyable for her neither if i play with her clitrois or labia when i made she cum was by masturbating her  finger in   but if i play with her pussy  oral or by hand  it does nt look like it is super enjoyable for her often when i give her oral  at some point sometimes she says to me something like  you are tormenting me  how long do you want to torment me    that basically means she wants to put the d in the v faster the same problem occurs when i lick her nippels i love them  but it does nt loke like she enjoys this thing so much  for me it s strangewhat s the problem  am i doing something wrong  an ex of mine had super intens orgasms when i gave her oral sex and playing wither tits  nipples was intense for her i think i could do her cumming only by playing with her nipples  do nt get me wrong  i do nt compare she with my ex she is wonderful and much above my ex  i really love her  but i want to know what s happening cuz i really want to satisfy her also  she never masturbated no  like never ever  she never did this this thing could have some  influence  ,4628nr,sex,lifestyle,1455626053.0,eman_on3,4.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

if you re feeling terrified and full of dread  do not go along with it stop where you are continue to talk about it continue to fantasize about it or role play with it  but do not actually do anything until you can think about it  without  being terrifiedfull of dread that way lies trouble  and it is  okay  if you are  never  comfortable with actually having a threesome  and note that there s a difference between being scarednervousanxious  kind of like the feeling you get before going on a roller coaster or going into an interview  and feeling like doom and gloom is going to descend on you if you do something  the thing with a threesome is  if everybody s going to play with everyone else  eg it s a triangle  not a v   then it s a positive if everyone  wants  everyone else  it s about everyone sexually enjoying everyone else if that s not something you can see yourself wanting or being okay with  then this may not be for you at the very least  it may not be something to jump into head first  i say that  because your thoughtsfeelingsreactions can shift over time  if you do  eventually  decide to engage in a threesome  understand that there s always the possibility that your boyfriend will pay more attention to the third party  even if it s not on purpose this does nt mean he does nt love and want you  but newnessit s exciting  you might even find yourself paying more attention to your guest than your boyfriend  in any kind of group encounter  you have to be willing and able to speak up and say  hey  can i get a little attention here   or  you need to have a nonverbal signal with your partner that tells him  i m feeling a little left out  or  slow down  you can also negotiate some things being  off the menu  for your first time out you say you changed your boundary from him not having piv sex with the third to him not coming inside her is that something you want  or were you just trying to make him happy  if it s the latter  you may need to revisit that boundary  bottom line  if you re not comfortable with something  do nt do it and do nt negotiate it if you decide you want to engage in a threesome at some point  find a middle ground with your boyfriend talk your boundaries death make a rule that if either one of you wants to quit  at any time  that you quit  though please be respectful to your third partner should you quit in the middle of things  and do nt act on anything if you feel that dread ,d010x4k,sex,lifestyle,1455567588.0,sangetencre,25.0,0.0,1,1337,0.0

before doing anything outside your comfort zone  it s always a good idea to communicate really really clearly about expectations talk about it  and then talk about it some more it does nt have to be tedious  it can be sexy fantasizing together  a threesome especially has great potential for awkwardness because it s an odd number third wheel  is a phrase for a reason  something that might help to consider  what do you want the dynamic of the threesome to feel like  possibilities   you and the bf focus on the other girl  sort of team up to pleasure her  bf and the other girl focus on you  you and the other girl focus on bf maybe you guys rotate between all these dynamics  sex  really  any interaction between people  always has a dyadic component that is  when it comes down to it  there is always an interaction happening between two people in a twosome  it s always the same two in a threesome  it switches around  and you ll have multiple twosomes happening at the same time  in sex particularly  one partner is always doing something to the other partner ie at the barest level  person a touches person b in a certain way and produces certain sensations it feels twoway if person b then reciprocates  or does something to person a at the same time in a twosome  both partners can always be simultaneously doing something to each other  it s a little harder to focus on two people simultaneously  so in a threesome  the reciprocity is not as straightforward  this might be getting way too abstract anyway  go back to the possibilities and think about which one you would be most comfortable with see if that helps ,d01fl9w,sex,lifestyle,1455590125.0,FierceCrayon,3.0,0.0,1,21,0.0

before  definitely good  during and after can be disguisting if you use normal condoms without flavor since these normal condoms just do nt taste and smell like anything you want to be cloth to you mouth best way to fix this is usung flavored condoms or go bareback sometimes the dried up female fluid around her pussy might not be that inviting to eat also  really depends on the level of the guys arousal  after bareback might turn off some guys because of their own cum however there are much more guys than one might expect who do nt mind licking their own cum  especially do nt mind if it comes out of her pussy this is mostly something that depends on the guys mood and how horny he is   edit  fixed spelling issues ,d02sogr,sex,lifestyle,1455680470.0,idfkagnn,1.0,0.0,1,-26,0.0

communication is so important for a healthy sex life  but i know it can feel uncomfortable  especially at first  this is a great place to start  discuss it with her it s not unusual to not cum from certain types of stimulation  especially when it s a new experience for you  to give you an ideait took me  female  a couple of months before i could cum from sex it s not that i was tense or nervous  i just simply had nt yet learned how to  let go  and enjoy a different type of stimulation  be honest and open with her tell her that you might not always cum  but that does nt mean you re not enjoying it if she starts to get tired and frustrated  switch to doing something else  another important thing to consider  if you masturbate with a death grip  than cumming from sex or oral will be a lot more difficult ,d02ur1m,sex,lifestyle,1455684104.0,lady-ada,1.0,0.0,1,302,0.0

i m a pretty ugly guy  there is very little about my face or body that would be considered attractive i know attraction is subjective  but i highly doubt any woman would consider me a 7 or above i imagine the subjectivity of attraction means i range from 25  maybe a 6 if i m particularly witty that day and i m not saying i only want supermodels  but i do want women i m attracted to given that there is nothing physically attractive about me  going for women who have attractive features means i m batting out of my league  it s well understood by almost everyone that attraction is an important part of a relationship  and pretty much the only factor in a hookup or fuck buddy situation nobody wants a relationship without attraction  that s just a friendship but when it comes to ugly people  apparently this does nt apply i m told to lower my standards  and take what i can get i should be grateful for unfulfilling sex with women i m not attracted to if i want a one night stand  it has to be with a woman as ugly as me  which is nt very tempting if i want a relationship  i m supposed to look past the physical and see the inner beauty  even though no woman with options would ever do that for me  i see a lot of unattractive couples  but honestly i think they re with each other because that s all they can get  and they both know it there s no passion  no attraction  no lust it s just that or dying alone you can call me shallow  but how many of you would date someone you were nt attracted to  i ve never felt passion  chemistry or mutual attraction i ve never been desired or lusted after if good looking women are nt attracted to me  why would an unattractive woman fancy me  the answer is they would nt  they d be settling for me just like i d be settling for them  and the relationship would be a sexless  passionless sham  is there any hope for people like me  am i making sense  or is this all just depressive bullshit  if so  why  tldri feel like i ll never have a good sexual relationship because the women i want are nt attracted to me  and the women i could get would just be settling for me  and i d be settling for them ,464q93,sex,lifestyle,1455658500.0,EverytingsShinyCaptn,2.0,0.0,1,249,0.0

a lot of girls get off on relinquishing controlpower over to the guy they want to be desired and wanted in the most extreme and dominating of ways when it comes to the bedroom  she longs for you to take complete control over her while also wanting you to tap into our human animistic sexual nature the problem that some guys have with this  is that the respect they have for their partners puts a mental block on them because society and social constructs tell us how we should treat a women be romantic  make love  be a gentleman ect ect when in truth that ai nt true or for the most part is not true when it s time to get down and dirty  in her mind she has to be a respectable lady for every second she s around other people to preserve the correct image so letting all that go with you when it s time for sex is what in guessing is either empowering or feeling free i do nt know maybe  but one thing is certain you need to be fucking her like she s your personal fuck toy a whore and a slut that s purely dedicated to you take her forcefully and remove all choice from her when doing it she wants to feel owned most of all so make sure you do other wise she will soon find herself disillusioned with her vanilla sex life and not getting what she needscraveslongs for,d01iaxk,sex,lifestyle,1455594426.0,DeadCell79,4.0,0.0,1,65,0.0

ignoring that objectively unattractive is an oxymoron  and assuming you just mean what most peoples subjective tastes are  the only meaningful question is  is it possible for  me  to have a satisfying sex life   then it depends on what you mean by possiblethe realm of human possibilities is vast and near infinite there are people who like to fuck corpses  people who like to fuck animals if those things are possible  then someone wanting to fuck an averagely unattractive guy is obviously fully possible  if by  possible  you mean  practical and realistic to expect   then that entirely depends on how ugly you are  how high your standards are  and how many chances you take  if you take maybe a handful of chances a year  and have a completely unremarkable life on top  then the odds are against you if you rely on your looks to attract people women who find you attractive are nt just going to drop into your life and sweep you off your feet  if you have a tendency to have automatic negative thoughts  then its important to make a distinction between actually being shit out of luck and actually not bothering to change things you have the power to change  if you re constantly meeting new people  getting involved in interesting and exciting things  improving yourself and the way you interact with people  and you ve not had the faintest whiff of interest from a girl then perhaps you re one of the extremely unfortunate minority who are nt going to have a mutually enjoyable sex life  if however you re spending most of your spare time in a pit of distraction and selfobsession  have an unfulfilling workhome life  and generally have one week look like any other week in your life with no change from year to year then you might consider that its not some inherent defect in yourself that s to blame  but an inevitable result of a habit of poor life choices  the fact you re dedicating time enough worrying about your appearance to ask the question probably means you re letting automatic negative thoughts dictate a lot of your behavior  and probably are nt dedicating sufficient energies to positive  fulfilling and enhancing life experiences  regardless of whether you re the ugliest guy in the world or not you can still have a happy  fulfilling life and have good relationships with other people  but this possibility gets more remote the more selfdestructive and selfpitying your thoughts are ,d02gic2,sex,lifestyle,1455661631.0,suninabox,1.0,0.0,147,66155,0.0
hello  have not ever posted to this subreddit but the more time goes on the more this issue is bothering me my boyfriend and i have a great relationship and i am very very sexually attracted to him he says he feels the same for me and sometimes i believe him because he is generally the one who initiates and sometimes even gets hard from brushing up against me when we are out places he is always telling me i am beautiful and he loves me but there is one big issue that leads me to believe he is nt sexually attracted to me the way i am to him  btw forgot to add this but we have been together 1 year 3 months we live together and i am 25 yr old and he is 32  we have sex often upwards of 5 times a week and the only way he can finish is by masturbating at the end on my face on or my chest while i dirty talk to him or moan when we do this he cums within a minute he says he is always close but just ca nt finish unless he does it he has cum inside of me quite a few times but he goes through spells where he will cum in me maybe 56times a month then go 3 months without cumming in me at all and when he has cum inside me the only way he can do that is from behind and once from the side and trying to get him to cum orally or with my hands is impossible it makes me feel utterly pathetic he says its something wrong with him not me but to me that just cant be right all my other boyfriends or men that i ve been with cum nearly instantly the first 15 times we have sex and after that they usually came within 10 minutes i just dont understand why i cant do that with the man i love  he can please me repeatedly without my help and i cant do anything to please him it eats away at me and his answer to it is that hes cum with me more than any other girl hes been with and hes never been able to cum from oral my boyfriend has had threesomes and orgies and been with hundreds of women while he was in the military this is just hard for me to believe that he ca nt cum  there has to be something wrong with me i have researched handjob and oral videos on how to do it better and he reacts to my new techniques well but i know him and he never even gets close from anything i do to him he insists it feels good and that i should nt worry so much about him going but he gets irritated if he ca nt make me cum  its a frustrating situation because i cant talk with him too much about it or it causes him even more performance anxiety so  i know this was alot of ranting but is this because of me not being sexually attractive enough to him or something else ,464nvd,sex,lifestyle,1455657656.0,latenightreads,1.0,0.0,3,222,0.0

it s partially a mental thing  getting the muscles to relax enough to allow for penetration   partially a lube thing  and partially an experience thing when you start having lots of good experiences  your body just warms up faster in terms of all of these things  the best thing you can do is to do lots of other stuff before penis time just because intercourse is now on the table does nt mean it s the only thing on the menu if she is feeling pain  back off  apply more lube and outerplay  and wait till she s begging for you to be inside her as for the progression from one finger to two  if your finger is pretty coateddrenched and she s into it  straight up ask her  in your sexiest voice  if she s ready for finger number 2  but do nt feel you have to rush it one day it may seem she s ready for two fingers right away  other days it may seem like forever till she s ready that s normal  i personally say that oral sex is a pretty good goto move as it can be combined with fingering  adds lube  and is neglected way too often basically  just go at her pace the more positive experiences she has in terms of pleasure  the easier it is for her body to respond positively the next time around ,d01j60o,sex,lifestyle,1455595850.0,need_more_hours,2.0,0.0,491,7094,1.0

the trouble with putting anything online is that once it s up there  it s up there forever and things like sex tapes have a nasty habit of disappearing from sight and mind for a while  then turning up again and biting you on the ass when you least expect it  like chicken pox turning into shingles  if she s really into the idea of filming and posting a video and you re ok with it too  then i d suggest taking steps to anonymise yourselves  maybe she could wear a mask  like the kind you d wear at a masquerade ball  or a luchador s mask  or a cardboard box that covers her face to just above her mouth  or whatever  anything that hides her identity   maybe you could use video editing software to obscure her face the same goes for you  too  if your face is in shot during the video  if either of you have any doubts  then in this case i d say  better to be safe than sorry  most definitely applies ,d02gndi,sex,lifestyle,1455661827.0,dctctx,2.0,0.0,691,22605,0.0
viagra  cialis  levitra  they all work a little different viagra seems to be the most reliable but causes the most stuffiness and headaches cialis is great if it works  but can cause a crippling back pain in some guys levitra seems to have the lowest success rate although this is the most popular order of effectiveness  some men will rate them completely opposite  and my point  why does your doctor think prescribing cialis is safer than viagra  if he feels you should nt take viagra  then you should nt be taking any of them it s highly possible the problem is psychological what really sucks is worrying about it makes the problem worse instead of ordering online  find a different doctor that better understands your problem and does nt use the term  likely  ,d02qy9i,sex,lifestyle,1455677630.0,the_other_bunny,1.0,0.0,1,27,0.0

fetish might not be the right word  i was nt sure what else to use anyway  i m male and have mainly identified as heterosexual  but ever since i was little i liked and was aroused by wearing women s clothing this itself is pretty common among people  but over the years i ve also become less and less interested in having sex as a man i ve never had sex  and my fantasies have almost always involved me changed into a woman  or being seen as one it s difficult for me to keep myself aroused if i imagine myself as a man having relations with a woman  or with a man either  however  the thought of being a woman  even in non sexual situations  is arousing to me even picturing myself talking to people and having them see me as a woman is a turn on this whole thing kind of bothers me i m just wondering if anyone else out there is similar and could share some experiences regarding this i do nt think i m the only person out there with a similar story  i m just sort of frustrated with this aspect of myself  also  i obviously dress as a woman a fair bit  which is nt much of a turn on in itself but  there are times when i see myself as a woman when i check myself out in the mirror  and it makes me feel pretty happyemotional  on top of some of those feelings of arousal that come from perceiving myself as a woman this is part of the frustration for me i m just feeling pretty confused about my identity and sexuality  and hope someone can relate and offer some advice or anything at times i almost wonder if i could be transgender  but the fact that i get aroused and everything just makes it feel like i m really just someone who is a little perverted ,46574s,sex,lifestyle,1455664346.0,skipchaddle,0.0,0.0,1,3,0.0

i m a male 23 year old virgin  but for some reason i almost never have any sex dreams and the few i have had are always terrible mainly because while sex is present in the dream it s never me having sex  because even in my dreams i m still rejected by the ladies  and the few dreams i have had where i m close to having sex nothing materializes as the dream changes into a nightmare before anything  amp  nbsp  anyway i ve become interested in lucid dreaming  thought it would be cool to be able to have sex in my dreams since it s not like it s going to happen in reallife  so after trying a few techniques for awhile i got some success last night was a bit different i actually got to have a sex dream though it was nt what i wanted so i was wondering why do i have such dreams  what could my dream i had last night mean  anyway it goes like this  amp  nbsp  so the dream starts off as an alien abduction  a light comes through my window and somehow beams me onto an alien ship where i immediately notice i m in some sort of surgical room with a bright light shining on my face  lying on a table with these stereotypical short  grey  like aliens standing over me wearing blue jumpsuits and equipped with various surgical tools  at first i m about to panic in fear  but then i decide to calmly assess the situation that s when i realize i m dreaming as i tell my self this ca nt be real as i notice a few absurdities in the dream  i get up ignoring the aliens and just yell out  sweet  i m being abducted by aliens in my dream   i m super excited at this point because since it s my dream i can rewrite reality so i choose to float around exploring the ship amazed at the incredible architecture i find i come up with a plan involving me spending my dream time exploring the galaxy in a cool starship filled with sexy alien girl harem  i know i m a nerd   unfortunately the moment i try to create the girls i wake up  amp  nbsp  after waking i realize i ve only slept for a few hours so i have plenty of time to go back to bed before work so i go back to sleep to continue my dream and hopefully have sex  amp  nbsp  strangely this time in the dream i notice i m naked and i ca nt see at all as i feel hands rubbing all over my body and a sensation of being carried  i realize i m dreaming so i m not worried but i wish i had some light to see what s going on  suddenly i notice lit torches appear around me providing some light and i see that i m in some sort of underground crypt and to my horror surrounded by rotting corpses and the creatures touching and carrying me are zombiesghouls  and skeletons  and i ca nt break free from their grasp  worse yet standing in front of me is a  female   http  oi64tinypiccom2dumrs6jpg   lich   http  wwwsanthariacompicturesfaugarfaugar_picslich1jpg  with glowing white eyes wearing tattered royal robes and a golden crown  amp  nbsp  i try to change the dream  like changing the scenery  changing the lich to a beautiful woman  removing the zombies  etc but nothing works the lich is too powerful and i find myself completely unable to change the dream the lich begins caressing me  licking me  and telling me how i want her and i m just in a state of shock  horror  and strangely some arousal  she also attempts to do some sort of sexy dance and tries to twerk which looks really strange considering she looks like a walking anorexic corpse  after her little dance she sings a few lyrics from   post to be    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  apxvscfoynu   which actually does nt sound half bad  ending with her going up to my ear whispering  if you want me to expose the freak  you got ta eat the booty like groceries  and i m like  wtf    she just ignores me pulls off her dress and tries to sit her undead ass on my face luckily i wake up  amp  nbsp  i try to clear my head and go back to bed hoping i get to have a sexy dream this time  after going back to sleep i try to imagine myself with a beautiful woman  but instead i m back with the lich trapped again this time she asks me why i m rejecting her and then she tells me she thinks i m gay and then with a wave of her hands summons a massive undead minotaur into the room and tells me something along the lines of the minotaur can  keep me company  as it slowly marches towards me as tentacles begin ripping out of it s rotting body i try to tell her i m not gay and definitely not interested in be ripped apart by some giant minotaur but she ignores me  not wanting to have some gay rape dream  i bail  immediately waking up at this point i m pretty annoyed and i just want to sleep so i can go to work in the morning so i go back to bed hoping just to have some peaceful rest  amp  nbsp  strangely i m back with the lich again  i create a giant explosion of light to incinerate her and her undead slaves while many of the undead disintegrate she remains completely unfazed  does nt react in any noticeable way  by this as innumerable undead surround me and then wrestle me to the ground  she disintegrates my clothing and summons her undead minotaur as her minions try to force me to  assume the position  not wanting this dream to get really really gay and painful i give up and lie to her telling her she is incredibly beautiful and that i ve always desired her  happy with this she tells her minions to stand down and we embrace and havesex which actually felt pretty good just dryand coldyeahwoke up feeling pretty dirty after that  nasty stuff  amp  nbsp    tl  dr    i have a lucid dream which gets hijacked by some undead woman who forces me to have sex with her ,462zju,sex,lifestyle,1455637501.0,VampireReaper,1.0,0.0,1,88,0.0

it depends on how you define safe the ph difference cab increase the chance of year yeast infections or other opportunistic bugs the urea and ammonia are nt exactly great for the tissues inside  and there s always the risk of uti  but not huge problems  unless you have something wrong with your urine  there should nt be any health concerns above and beyond sex itself really i d recommend staying well hydrated so the concentrations of waste are low though,d00xerz,sex,lifestyle,1455562542.0,southsamurai,104.0,0.0,20,8749,0.0
this one comes up pretty often on the sub bottom line is that yes  it s safe  more or less the biggest risk that you run is screwing up the ph balance of her vagina and having a negative impact on her normal vaginal florafauna  in other words  setting up conditions that can lead to a yeast infection  some people do have the yeast infection issues some people never have any problems whatsoever ,d016ran,sex,lifestyle,1455576152.0,alittlebirdy1,36.0,0.0,1,12407,0.0

my boyfriend  22 m  and i  22 f  are in a committed relationship we met online  and had the opportunity to be together when i was visiting on a holiday and things got much more serious from there we were together a few weeks  and now he is planning on coming to be with me around midyear  when we were together we did sexual acts  ie hand jobs  blow jobs  piv  around two or three times every day we were together  and nothing he could nt cum  unless he finished himself off rarely and every sexual encounter was an 13 hours which was exhausting  and honestly frustrating  he says most of it was nerves  i understand but we were together a lot i think it could be deathgrip  but for those few weeks he was nt masturbating so i m unsure of that also my friends all recount experiences of being able to make their male partners come really quick  and male friends that i ve mentioned this to saying it sounds weird to them also  i feel really inadequate i ve suffered from terrible self esteem a lot of my life  and i m worried if we do be together and he makes this huge move  i m just going to feel like crap if i can not help him cum i ve always loved making a man cum also  it s very satisfying  and this is something i may not get to experience  tldr  if you could nt make your male partner orgasm  or he could nt orgasm with you  do you think you could stay ,466j7a,sex,lifestyle,1455683096.0,oliviaolivex,3.0,0.0,1,6,0.0

i  ve been with my first boyfriend for about three months now and things have been going great so far the only problem is that he can  t get an erection when we  re together  even though he always claims to be really into whatever we  re doing this ends up making him frustrated  because he says it  s all in his head he can get hard thinking about it later  just not at the time i  m his first real girlfriend so i think nerves might be part of the issue  since he s told me it s definitely not a physical thing   but i don  t know what else i can do to help i  ve tried oral  and he  s tried to get it up himself  but nothing has worked i know that he probably already feels pretty bad about this  so i don  t want to say anything that  ll upset him  but at the same time it  s really affecting our relationship and my self esteem what should i do ,465y2l,sex,lifestyle,1455674970.0,123432throwaway,0.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

pe is frustrating  but there are physical solutions  get a set of simple  cheap silicone cock rings and some promescent delay spray if he also has ed  sounds like he does nt   then of course get some cialis  viagra  or levitra  for cock rings i recommend the inexpensive set from screaming o called the ringo x3  about  12 bucks   one for behind the balls and a couple of choices for base of the shaft  i wear one behind and one at the base simultaneously   you can also buy the xl ring for thicker shafts or more construction behind the cock and balls keeps him up  delays ejaculation  makes him his biggest  and produces better orgasms for him he will want to shave down there and use lube taking them on and off if you like to perform fellatio i recommend flavored lube they say do nt wear them for more than 2030 minutes but i ve gone longer with no trouble  it s astonishing how few men know about the wonders of cock rings my wife absolutely raves about them with respect to both aesthetics and performance  with the promescent  he should put a little on his finger and rub it under the head of his cock to control amount and placement once he gets it right he will last as long you want this product absorbs through skin almost immediately so it will not stay on the surface of his cock and numb you  please do try these things guys with pe tend to become very good at cunnilingus and foreplay   she comes first  both figuratively and literally   and these solutions can help him also be a good fuck he can go from his orgasm being a failure to loving it when he finally gets there there is a big difference in how a man s own orgasm feels both mentally and physically after exertion and working for it at least this has been my experience ,d01ym3s,sex,lifestyle,1455637062.0,SpinachD,1.0,0.0,1,9,0.0

personally  i love choking a partner  but i never try to actually cut off breathing or blood flow for me  it s more about the dominance of having her by the throat and controlling her that way i do nt squeeze hard enough to cut off blood flow  even temporarily  though  a good way to get a really dominant effect without actually squeezing that tightly is to slide your hand upwards slightly as you squeeze there s a little bit of slip where the skin can slide relative to the underlying tissue  so you start with the top of your hand maybe a half inch to an inch below her neckline then as you squeeze you slide upwards so your hand is nestled into the neckline crease psychologically  it feels like you are tightening your grip  and it really puts her into your power  but you do nt actually have to squeeze tight enough to interrupt blood flow ,d00r4v0,sex,lifestyle,1455553318.0,Mr_Spaz,71.0,0.0,2836,37262,0.0

if she started to go blue and starts tapping your hand then it s time to let go lol  jokes aside just use a bit of common sense just squeeze firmly around her throat in a major where you re holding her in place and pined down rather then a full on choke  if you want to stealthily question her on weather she liked it or not  is to just tell her that you had to make sure you did nt get too carried away because you enjoyed it too much that you felt like squeezing harder  then pay attention to her response she will either say that was enough or she would say something along the lines of wanting you to go a little harderrougher ect,d01im5s,sex,lifestyle,1455594932.0,DeadCell79,1.0,0.0,1,65,0.0
what i have found to be safe and effective is to place the palm of my hand on the upper sternum with my fingers on the neck i press lightly on the sternum  not on the neck  in order to constrict breathing without putting pressure on anything delicate the fingers lightly on the neck still give the person the impression of being choked without the actual choking bonus  if the person bruises easily  marks on the sternum are easier to cover up than marks on the neck ,d00qv8b,sex,lifestyle,1455552901.0,dagnart,1.0,0.0,266,77221,0.0

there are certain stages of arousal you might experience initial stage  plateau  and climax you ll want to work on getting to the plateau part without jumping straight from initial to climax for some people  like myself  getting to the point of orgasm and then stopping  some call it edging  will help you to eventually ease into the plateau stage if you feel yourself jumping straight to climax do nt be embarrassed in telling your partner that you need to ease into the experience to make the most out of it stop stimulation if you need to and do some other activity like kiss or petting in the meantime i used to have a need to fight off an orgasm with all my might first in order to achieve the plateau stage so i could enjoy some longer sessions fighting off the first initial orgasm does something to the climax response almost like the refractory period but not entirely it ll let you get to the plateau stage and then ease up to a more enjoyable finish  it s all really a matter of experience  learning your own body  and not being embarrassed about communicating with your partner after all  they like you enough to be giving you bj s  another thing is that your partner might be flattered that they turn you on so much they might enjoy that you re that sensitive and be willing to accommodate if you put it in those terms  i m really turned on  let me ease into this  or more bluntly  i do nt wan na come too fast  i m really turned on  hold up a second so i can take it slow getting to the good part  things do nt always need to be fast and furious ,d01z3zw,sex,lifestyle,1455637844.0,FireandGaslight,2.0,0.0,1,23,0.0

if you re uncomfortable about it  you need to tell him that sometimes you ca nt stand nipple play but that you ca nt explain why and that it absolutely ruins your sexual experience this is so he does nt take it as something wrong with him and that it s a problem that s not going to go away by itself i think it s a bit odd that it s only sometimes you do nt like it but maybe it s a kind of problem where sometimes stimulation there is too intense for you to enjoy once both of you have talked about the problem  you can both discuss why you think it happens is it when he touches you more roughly  is it always after you cum  is it when your nipples are the first thing he touches  make a few guesses and try new things and see how you feel about it do nt worry about failing sex  just try to get to the bottom of it if you do nt find out what triggers it  i have no experience with this but as a last resort maybe some therapy could help  maybe you link your assault with nipple play in a way that even you do nt realise ,d02s7y3,sex,lifestyle,1455679698.0,the_dogeranger,1.0,0.0,27,3077,0.0

honestly i wish i could cum really quickly from blowjobs but that s never been the case i last longer from a blowjob than sex half of my issue is constantly worrying what my mate is thinking  if i m taking too long and  come on cum  cum   which just gives me anxiety i guess so now i m offered blow jobs but when the realization of a 3045 min head banging session kicks in  she will immediately redact it some women will think they are just that damn good at bj s to make you come so fast cause it totally kills a woman s confidence if it takes her forever to make you sperm i kinda blame this on me doing too many kegels though  sometimes i last way too long during sex so i will back off on the kegels exercises to find the sweet spot this never transfers well to bj s for me but i imagine it ll help you all around okay enough about me listen just squeeze your ass cheeks really hard and then let go after 1 second while your driving home from work or playing domino s with your nan or some shit rinse and repeat until you ve done it about 75100 times next thing you know you ll pop up quicker  last longer and jack up your firepower from a red rider bee bee gun to some 12 gauge buck shot warning  do nt shoot your eye out  kid ,d0205jx,sex,lifestyle,1455639416.0,YouRatBastard,2.0,0.0,2186,230,0.0

well first the rule of sexual adventures  if you do nt feel comfortable with it  you should wait do nt force yourself you sound like you are pretty young  you still have plenty of time to get comfortable in your relationship and if you never try it  so what  it s not the end of the world  threesomes  like every other sexual activity  require a lot of communication  both before hand and during the act before hand  make sure to set rules and boundaries you are comfortable with come up with a signal in case you are not comfortable and want to change something to the setup during the act another signal if you want to stop everything  honestly  finding the right partner  especially a single woman  will be hard so brace yourself and prepare to be patient do not accept anything that is just  mostly to satisfy his fantasy  if you are not 100  on board talk to the person you have in mind too  as her opinion will also play a role  some people would not go for a threesome where there is no penetration  for example  or in the contrary she might not be comfortable with piv at all and only want feminine contact it all depends   do nt stress too much for now  give yourself time  and you will be fine  ,d00s82w,sex,lifestyle,1455555004.0,LV1016,72.0,0.0,2094,2297,0.0

it might be a little counterintuitive  but her willingness to be degraded by you is a sign of trust for me it s not really a way to be degraded per se but a way to belong  i m not  a  slut  i m  your  slut it s perhaps the biggest sign of handing control because it s such a harsh word and tied in with all sorts of feminist stuff  with this concept that women must always be in control  that strength is measured solely by dominance to be submissive to one person  to give up control  takes a lot more strength  self assurance and trust than to assume control sure  it turns her on but it s also telling you that she trusts you to respect her out of the bedroom  it s a sign that she s letting herself go  remember aftercare always aftercare do nt roll around and go to sleep if you ve spent the last half hour calling her a slut making the distinction between play and real life is so important ,d01q94e,sex,lifestyle,1455613771.0,raspbewwies,2.0,0.0,2,1826,0.0

i see this issue fairly regularly in this subreddit it might be worth your time to search for similar stories in the sidebar  that said  he does nt get to control your orgasms or access to them your comment about his ego is totally on point i m guessing that the  numbness  argument is just to deflect from the real issue  which is almost certainly his ego and insecurities mature lovers see sex toys as a potential aid  not a rival  he does not get to tell you what you can and can not do with your body if he objects to using them together  that s his prerogative  but you deserve pleasure  and he has no right to make those kinds of calls for what you do on your own time he also does nt get to unilaterally close the subject  as he did the other day ,d01scb2,sex,lifestyle,1455622341.0,beanieandpeach,4.0,0.0,1,2308,0.0

i ve been in a situation close to your gf s fantasy  and it went great the night we all hooked up  but it ended badly later on  a couple i knew  just casually  not close friends  invited me out to have drinks with them at a bar because i was in their neighborhood for some other reason they were both super friendly  flirty  to me  we had a good time  ended up getting pretty drunk but nothing overtly sexual going on we certainly never discussed having a threesome  went back to their place to crash  as i could nt drive home  they told me to sleep in their bed  i thought it meant one of them would stay on the couch  as a courtesy to a guest  drunk me thought it seemed reasonable  nope  all together in one bed i get squished between them in the middle cozy  anyway i just pass out  i m drunk and tired  in the morning  i wake up with the dude spooning me with a boner anyway we ended up having a threesome  it was super fun and hot  i thought everything went great and afterward we planned to meet up and do it again in the future  turns out  she was actually super uncomfortable with seeing me and her boyfriend have sex in front of her  but did nt want to wreck it for him in the moment it ended up setting off a whole chain of insecure and dishonest behavior from her  and tonedeaf and selfish behavior from him it exposed a lot of relationship problems they d had for years but never dealt with they ended up breaking up about a year later  i m not sure if discussing it beforehand might have changed some of that  but it could nt have made it any worse might have kept everyone s expectations in check better ,d02f0cd,sex,lifestyle,1455659547.0,guerre-eclair,4.0,0.0,4377,6193,0.0
i m of the opinion that you can negotiate and consent to sex if you re just tipsy however  i draw the line at drunk  i think it s okay to meet at a bar and each have a drink or two and then discuss the possibility of all going home together and what that would look like it can definitely be flirty and fun but it should be honest and clear  i also think if anyone slides into that drunk state then you should just cap the evening at some kissing and then head your separate ways with an agreement to seal the deal next time  also be mindful in the chasing that you do nt slide into coercison or creepiness always leave your third prey lots of outs if they stop feeling it at any time remember  the people in the relationship are more important than the relationship itself   i m ripping this off from poly writers eve amp  franklin   your third is also a person and how all three of you feel is more important than having the threesome ,d02a8lz,sex,lifestyle,1455653246.0,Girl_Dinosaur,4.0,0.0,1,586,0.0

hi all  i m a teen guy  16  who might have sex with my girlfriend in a few months i m uncircumcised  so i m not sure how sex works with that i m assuming that  as i ll be hard  i ll just do it with my foreskin back the whole time so it s my bare head in continuous contact  obviously it s pretty sensitive since i m uncut  but i m assuming the inside of a vagina is wet and soft enough to be comfortable  or no  i ll also obviously be using a condom if i end up doing it  so how will this make it harder  thank you so much in advance ,461y80,sex,lifestyle,1455619681.0,throwawaysex2k16,5.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
you are supposed to be uncut my countries does nt really circumcised anymore we have sex normally  it s even easier actually the skin is there to play a role just out on the condom while erected and it will work how it is supposed to,d01s7ba,sex,lifestyle,1455621786.0,blueXcat,12.0,0.0,2868,21365,0.0
not being circumcised is the norm in a hell of a lot of places  and it s the natural state of a penis sex is nt any more difficult with a foreskin  in fact it s probably easier since there is less of a necessity for lube  your foreskin will move just like it does when you masturbate it slides up and down practice putting a condom on a few times and masturbating before you are planning to have sex so you can figure out how to do it properly and comfortably  the inside of a vagina is wet and soft  unlike your hand the sensitivity you feel is a good thing  though the sensations of sex can be a little weird the first time since you think a lot about what you re meant to be doing and feeling try to relax  you have nothing to worry about  and remember that everyone was inexperienced at some point but you will work it out with time and practice  the faq is a great thing to read  so i would recommend you take a look happy sexhaving ,d023g7k,sex,lifestyle,1455644075.0,such_a_sin,4.0,0.0,1,14711,0.0
it works the same way for circumcised and uncircumcised the foreskin naturally rolls back as you thrust in and exposes the head for all that nice vagina kissing  when wearing a condom  you have your hard cock as normal  pinch the top of the condom  place it on the top of your penis and roll down you should have a good bit of excess condom at the top to catch cum and what not as you move in and out with the condom on  your foreskin will naturally move a bit  but it all works the same 8090  of the work is not circumcised  so it is pretty normal  ,d0280dr,sex,lifestyle,1455650265.0,Chubguyv1980,2.0,0.0,1,72,0.0
buy condoms  practice putting them on and getting comfortable with them having foreskin will make it a bit harder  so practice to see what works for you masturbate with them make sure you find a brandtype that fits you well and is nt choking you  also  buy good lube not drugstore crap sliquid is nice  or probably anything a decent sex store has  your foreskin does retract all the way  correct  then you should nt have any problems without a condom  or with a female condom  it will naturally move around with a condom  standard advice is to pull it back first you ll have a condom over you  so that will dull sensitivity a bit you can add a small dab of lube to the inside tip of the condom ,d027h3k,sex,lifestyle,1455649536.0,plantstand,1.0,0.0,3,13792,0.0

fetish might not be the right word  i was nt sure what else to use anyway  i m male and have mainly identified as heterosexual  but ever since i was little i liked and was aroused by wearing women s clothing this itself is pretty common among people  but over the years i ve also become less and less interested in having sex as a man i ve never had sex  and my fantasies have almost always involved me changed into a woman  or being seen as one it s difficult for me to keep myself aroused if i imagine myself as a man having relations with a woman  or with a man either  however  the thought of being a woman  even in non sexual situations  is arousing to me even picturing myself talking to people and having them see me as a woman is a turn on this whole thing kind of bothers me i m just wondering if anyone else out there is similar and could share some experiences regarding this i do nt think i m the only person out there with a similar story  i m just sort of frustrated with this aspect of myself  also  i obviously dress as a woman a fair bit  which is nt much of a turn on in itself but  there are times when i see myself as a woman when i check myself out in the mirror  and it makes me feel pretty happyemotional  on top of some of those feelings of arousal that come from perceiving myself as a woman this is part of the frustration for me i m just feeling pretty confused about my identity and sexuality  and hope someone can relate and offer some advice or anything at times i almost wonder if i could be transgender  but the fact that i get aroused and everything just makes it feel like i m really just someone who is a little perverted ,46574s,sex,lifestyle,1455664346.0,skipchaddle,0.0,0.0,1,3,0.0

hey everyone  i m new to this sub so if this does nt belong here  please forgive me  so my boyfriend and i have been in a primarily long distance relationship for a little over a year  as he s studying abroad we skype all the time when we can  i study at home  online  and our chemistry is great  we re pretty open when it comes to sex  which is amazing  and we ve talked about trying anal but whenever we try it hurts a lot and i ve encountered spots of blood later on in the day we ve tried inserting a finger in my ass  which went well  but upon removal my anus  froze up  and would nt budge when he tried to put his penis in we ve been using lube so it was nt dry sex  my problem is that  he s coming home in a week or so  and i really want to do this with him he says he has no problems with us not doing it  and i believe him  but i know that if we do it ll be pleasantly surprising for him  is there anything iwe can do to make this happen  so i need to prep at home by myself  how do i do this  advice would really be appreciated  tl  dr  in a ldr  boyfriend comes home in a week  need advice on how to make anal sex happen without it hurting or bleeding    edit    i probably should add that i ve had anal bleeding before  though it s only a tiny spot of blood  even when making a bowel movement this kind of makes me scared as well ,45z3mb,sex,lifestyle,1455574628.0,stopthenadness,60.0,0.0,5,74,0.0
the bleeding is likely from a hemorrhoid  if you re getting them from bowel movements  this is probably the culprit maybe go see a doctor to verify  one thing to consider on insertion  do nt clamp down instead  try pushing out  as if you are having a bowel movement this relaxes the anal ring and makes penetration  far  easier ,d016j6r,sex,lifestyle,1455575804.0,alittlebirdy1,11.0,0.0,1,12407,0.0
start with a toy that you re comfortable with and work your way up to wider and wider toys each time relax   do nt clench use lots and lots of lube this ca nt be stressed enough  leave the toys in for some time  maybe move them around to let your muscles feel them take them out after a few minutes and apply more lube it can get dry and that is not fun do nt over do it in one sitting if you start feeling sore  stop and continue the next day giving your muscles a chance to relax you ll find that you can start off almost where you left off if you leave it off for a few weeks or more  you re going to have to repeat the process again  if you use a butt plug  do nt leave it in for too long  even though it may feel amazing    and use a lot of lube butt plugs tend to dry up a lot since there s not much in and out movement also  the length does nt matter  the width does butt plugs flare up and if you ca nt take that width comfortably it s going to hurt a lot what s worse  is that since the neck is small you re going to get used to that feeling  and when you try to pull it out after a while  it will hurt like a mofo this will get worse the longer you leave it in  finally get a toy that matches your bf in length and width as close as possible  and make that your goal one thing you will find out is that if you go in deeper  you will hit your inner intestines these are clenched inside you at first if your bf s dick is long enough it will hit this point and possibly penetrate it this feels different make sure you know how this feels  have i mentioned lube  get a big bottle   and have fun with it anal sex can be super awesome ,d01umfm,sex,lifestyle,1455629348.0,needs_a_shave,1.0,0.0,1,5,0.0

hi there so this probably seems like a shallow issue to have  but i want to get some other people opinions i m 18 and my girlfriend s 19  we ve been together for 4 months and things are going great we ve never argued  are honest about our feelings with each other and are in love   heads up  lots of detail  i just have one issue and that is that i go down on my gf a reasonable amount  at least a couple times a week sometimes even twice in 24 hours but she hardly touches my penis telling me penises are weird  now i understand that everyone feels differently about giving and receiving but i just feel as if this is a bit selfish of her i mean  we re both virgins  and its our first serious relationship each  but she gets to reach orgasm with my tongue in her vagina and i get told my anatomy is weird vaginas are weird too  at first she said that she thought oral and using hands on each others genitals was disconnecting that excuse disappeared when i started licking her out she s happy to let me go down there with her uncut pubes  but the one time she attempted to give me hand job she just stared at the ceiling and made a face and then decided she did nt like it and stopped  i m quite a selfless person  and i find it hard to ask for this stuff  but yknow i feel as if there s a real imbalance here i ll give her oral without a second thought because i know she enjoys it  but if i ask for anything i get told maybe later i feel as if i put a lot more effort into this part of the relationship than she does  and more than she realises  i do plan to be honest with her how i feel  but i m not sure how to approach the issue or what i can suggest i feel as if i d have more luck suggesting to have sex than for anything in return  so there you have it  thanks for reading my anecdote  i appreciate it looking forward to what you guys have to say ,465cqd,sex,lifestyle,1455666581.0,Lukai-9,8.0,0.0,1,42,0.0

pe is frustrating  but there are physical solutions  get a set of simple  cheap silicone cock rings and some promescent delay spray if he also has ed  sounds like he does nt   then of course get some cialis  viagra  or levitra  for cock rings i recommend the inexpensive set from screaming o called the ringo x3  about  12 bucks   one for behind the balls and a couple of choices for base of the shaft  i wear one behind and one at the base simultaneously   you can also buy the xl ring for thicker shafts or more construction behind the cock and balls keeps him up  delays ejaculation  makes him his biggest  and produces better orgasms for him he will want to shave down there and use lube taking them on and off if you like to perform fellatio i recommend flavored lube they say do nt wear them for more than 2030 minutes but i ve gone longer with no trouble  it s astonishing how few men know about the wonders of cock rings my wife absolutely raves about them with respect to both aesthetics and performance  with the promescent  he should put a little on his finger and rub it under the head of his cock to control amount and placement once he gets it right he will last as long you want this product absorbs through skin almost immediately so it will not stay on the surface of his cock and numb you  please do try these things guys with pe tend to become very good at cunnilingus and foreplay   she comes first  both figuratively and literally   and these solutions can help him also be a good fuck he can go from his orgasm being a failure to loving it when he finally gets there there is a big difference in how a man s own orgasm feels both mentally and physically after exertion and working for it at least this has been my experience ,d01ym3s,sex,lifestyle,1455637062.0,SpinachD,1.0,0.0,1,9,0.0

you could try edging basically stimulate him  suckfuckwank be creative  for a set time eg 15 mins get him close to cumming  then stop everything just before he cums and i mean stop everything you both can not touch his cock until he does nt want to cum anymore after the 15 mins he can cum then as he gets better at it try to increase the time from 15 mins to 23 hours  it sounds horrible but learning how to edge helps me last longer i can keep going as long as needed then cum when i m sure she s had just about enough always leave them wanting more  aka finishing before the chaffing starts  as you get better at edging is all you have to do is stop thrusting for awhile or change positions  maybe if i m getting a bj i ll go down on her or say i want to fuck and the feeling eventually passes  i promise you he will thank you for showing him how to edge the orgasms are bigger  stronger and more intense after edging for 2 or 3 hours ,d01wrom,sex,lifestyle,1455633896.0,fleckofly,1.0,0.0,1,118,0.0
one practical option is to have him give you oral beforehand and then start intercourse right away as soon as you orgasm that way the pressure is off to some extent because you already came and are very turned on when it starts works well unless you are someone who does nt like intercourse right after orgasm  some women seem to love it and others not   if you do nt like it then he could stop just before you climax and come on in ,d01ay8k,sex,lifestyle,1455582800.0,PopeyeKhan,20.0,0.0,1,691,0.0

so here is the situation we have been married for 7 years we have a 3 year old girl on weekdays we are both very busy my wife gets up at 5am gets our 3 yr old ready heads out drops her off at her best friends house on the way to work i start work a little later then her so i get up at 8am get ready for work and head out my wife works from 8  5pm monday and friday and 8noon the rest of the week she also works every other saturday from 8  1pm i work every weekday from 10  30  6pm  occasionally we have sex but it feels passionless and so does our kissing she always just has her hands at her side and lips puckered for a kiss but no effort she got angry one morning when i brought up sex to her on monday morning and told me we are friends without benefits she was angry as she tells me she has so much to do in the morning i should nt ask for sex i am hoping that is the only reason she said that i told her that is not the marriage i want she tells me she has 0 libido  there are these libido increasing vitamins she tried for a bit and they helped but for some reason she stopped taking them and i do nt want to push that on her i m getting ready to go back to college for my mba and i feel like i am in a passion less marriage which is depressing she does so much each day as you can tell i try to shower her with appreciation and love and i buy her flowers i ve even read no more mr nice guy and am trying to see if those changes could help we have a cruise scheduled for october this year with our daughter being watched by my wife s friend i m hoping that helps some  i do nt want to live in a passionless marriage i need to figure out some way to get our passion back when we started dating she had insanely strong libido to the point she would want it 3 or so times a day and i had a hard time keeping up now i m lucky to get it once a week whenever i ask her why she loves me she always mentions she loves my brain  my heart  and that i am a great father i feel she has lost any physical attraction when i asked her about that she said i definetly enjoy your presence when you are near me i recently got a board game called  an enchanting evening  we played it together the night before vday there are spaces on the board game with physical activities and verbal activities whenever she got to a physical activity she would make a frustrated  ugh  but would still do what the card said maybe she was being silly not sure  anyways that board game has a rule whoever wins gets their wish fulfilled my wife cracked jokes her wish would be to go right to bed ugh my wife is completely unhappy with how she looks to the point she refuses to have sex with the lights on and she wo nt let me see her naked unless it s dark she also only wants to have sex doggie style when we do because she says it s the deepest penetration and her favorite but it s always the same if we have sex she goes to the same spot same position and there is no foreplay hell i ve offered repeatedly to lick her pussy but she always refuses i asked her if she dislikes her pussy licked and she says no i love it well anyways i won the board game so i had her have sex with me with the lights on in different positions with us facing each other and i told her repeatedly how beautiful she is during because i truly think she is nothing has really changed as of yet but i think her understanding i think she is beautiful is important also in 7 years of marriage that was one of the few times we had sex with the lights on  any suggestions to help revive my wife s passion is appreciated i know it s a long read thanks again,462aiy,sex,lifestyle,1455627037.0,Falcon68,8.0,0.0,1,1104,0.0

agreed with other comentator we would need more specifics as to the motion in order to make a suggestion if u can get off at all  you can keep exploring until it works try laying off that method so you are more sensitive and receptive to things he can do for you  or you can do for yourself while together some guys get death grip  some are like you  some only can with a vibe because have been desensitized as long as working thru it together  should remove any frustrations ,d028cjr,sex,lifestyle,1455650720.0,throwbackbackback,1.0,0.0,1,1931,0.0
definite throwaway my recent sexual encounters has have been with girls who increasingly like being  lightly  dominated  spanking  choking kind of thing my current girlfriend  of  3 months  is into the same thing but a bit more extreme  she wants rough sex  but also wants dirty talk during sex  already  no idea what i m doing there   recently during the height of passion she asked me to call her a slut  or my slut   and fuck her hard i obliged but honestly it s something i ve always found a bit difficult watching porn and seeinghearing that level of degrading was always a turn off  we spoke about it afterwards and i explained that i was nt really all that comfortable with it but i will happily try to deal this is me trying to deal  do you have any advice  especially now to get over the selfconscious next time this comes up  ,45x6i0,sex,lifestyle,1455552850.0,call-me-a-slut-throw,158.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

a lot of girls get off on relinquishing controlpower over to the guy they want to be desired and wanted in the most extreme and dominating of ways when it comes to the bedroom  she longs for you to take complete control over her while also wanting you to tap into our human animistic sexual nature the problem that some guys have with this  is that the respect they have for their partners puts a mental block on them because society and social constructs tell us how we should treat a women be romantic  make love  be a gentleman ect ect when in truth that ai nt true or for the most part is not true when it s time to get down and dirty  in her mind she has to be a respectable lady for every second she s around other people to preserve the correct image so letting all that go with you when it s time for sex is what in guessing is either empowering or feeling free i do nt know maybe  but one thing is certain you need to be fucking her like she s your personal fuck toy a whore and a slut that s purely dedicated to you take her forcefully and remove all choice from her when doing it she wants to feel owned most of all so make sure you do other wise she will soon find herself disillusioned with her vanilla sex life and not getting what she needscraveslongs for,d01iaxk,sex,lifestyle,1455594426.0,DeadCell79,4.0,0.0,1,65,0.0
as i guy who respects his so  i get where you re coming from  it s difficult to separate your thoughts and emotions from the situation you re both in while even i still struggle with this from time to time  i just try to remember that i m not actually degrading her  we re both on the same page and these are just words we re using to enhance the situation my advice is just try to recognize the fact that  in the bedroom  we try new and different things to keep things fun an interesting name calling and dirty talk are sort of tools for roleplay  trying to be someone other than the proper guys and girls we portray in public  but they do nt change who you are keep at it  as long as you re both aware that you re not actually trying to degrade her in a harmful   real  way  you re good to go hope that helps ,d00rh9k,sex,lifestyle,1455553859.0,Zoriar,7.0,0.0,73,28,0.0

it might be a little counterintuitive  but her willingness to be degraded by you is a sign of trust for me it s not really a way to be degraded per se but a way to belong  i m not  a  slut  i m  your  slut it s perhaps the biggest sign of handing control because it s such a harsh word and tied in with all sorts of feminist stuff  with this concept that women must always be in control  that strength is measured solely by dominance to be submissive to one person  to give up control  takes a lot more strength  self assurance and trust than to assume control sure  it turns her on but it s also telling you that she trusts you to respect her out of the bedroom  it s a sign that she s letting herself go  remember aftercare always aftercare do nt roll around and go to sleep if you ve spent the last half hour calling her a slut making the distinction between play and real life is so important ,d01q94e,sex,lifestyle,1455613771.0,raspbewwies,2.0,0.0,2,1826,0.0

soo  first of all  srry for my shit english back to the topic  i love giving oral sex to my girlfriend buuut  i ca nt make her cum we have sex almost every weekend when she comes to my place and viceversa and we ve been together for about 6 months now and this thing frustrates me because i m not the only one in this relationship and i want to make she feel good yes  she really enjoys sex  but i ca nt make she cum i did it one time  she cummed twice  but only then the idea is that she is saying oral sex is tormenting her and it does nt seems to be so enjoyable for her neither if i play with her clitrois or labia when i made she cum was by masturbating her  finger in   but if i play with her pussy  oral or by hand  it does nt look like it is super enjoyable for her often when i give her oral  at some point sometimes she says to me something like  you are tormenting me  how long do you want to torment me    that basically means she wants to put the d in the v faster the same problem occurs when i lick her nippels i love them  but it does nt loke like she enjoys this thing so much  for me it s strangewhat s the problem  am i doing something wrong  an ex of mine had super intens orgasms when i gave her oral sex and playing wither tits  nipples was intense for her i think i could do her cumming only by playing with her nipples  do nt get me wrong  i do nt compare she with my ex she is wonderful and much above my ex  i really love her  but i want to know what s happening cuz i really want to satisfy her also  she never masturbated no  like never ever  she never did this this thing could have some  influence  ,4628nr,sex,lifestyle,1455626053.0,eman_on3,4.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

i think there s a distinction between calling someone a slut versus calling someone  my slut   the latter is nt meant to be degrading  because you re not trying to make the woman feel bad about herself it s more so you telling her that she belongs to you and praising her for being so good at catering to your sexual needs my bf will call me his slut when he wants to order me around but also when he s doing things for me like oral   i want to make my slut feel so good    i want to give my slut so many orgasms  etc   since she s into being dominated  ordering her to call you  sirmaster  can be just as effective without feeling like you re degrading the person  also  cuddling at the very end of your session might make you feel better because you get to remind her how much you love and respect her and how everything you did just prior was play  just some ideas ,d016vvx,sex,lifestyle,1455576345.0,throwawayacct963,2.0,0.0,1,55,0.0
so on valentine s day we wanted to watch a sexy film and after googling a bit we decided to watch love  the film involves a couple who has loads of nice sex  who then decide to have a threesome with their new sexy neighbour  me and my boyfriend have been talking about having a threesome with another girl for a while we have discussed our limits  at first him not doing piv  eventually changing to him not cuming inside of her   this was mostly to satisfy his fantasy and for me to explore something i ve been interested in trying for a while  now after watching that scene which starts very hot but ends up with the guy paying much more attention to the other girl i feel so terrified because it i imagined my boyfriend enjoying fucking some other girl like that and i just started crying after the scene i had this horrible pit in my stomach and felt so emotional this is something that would have turned me on so much before when i was single  he was amazing about it  comforted me  and even mentioned before i could say anything that he thought too much time was spent on the other girl i trust him completely we went to a strip club once where they payed a lot of attention to me and i even encouraged them to pay attention to him as well i was fine with that but the thought of him wanting  desiring another girl freaks me out completely he has watched chatturbate while we were having sex a couple of times and i keep worrying that he wants someone else  what should i do  should i go along with it and hope that i will be okay with it  like the strip club  or put a stop to it  i love him so much and i want to make this happen for him  but that scene wo nt get out of my head ,45x9eh,sex,lifestyle,1455553813.0,Throwawaythrsm,447.0,0.0,1,153,0.0

well first the rule of sexual adventures  if you do nt feel comfortable with it  you should wait do nt force yourself you sound like you are pretty young  you still have plenty of time to get comfortable in your relationship and if you never try it  so what  it s not the end of the world  threesomes  like every other sexual activity  require a lot of communication  both before hand and during the act before hand  make sure to set rules and boundaries you are comfortable with come up with a signal in case you are not comfortable and want to change something to the setup during the act another signal if you want to stop everything  honestly  finding the right partner  especially a single woman  will be hard so brace yourself and prepare to be patient do not accept anything that is just  mostly to satisfy his fantasy  if you are not 100  on board talk to the person you have in mind too  as her opinion will also play a role  some people would not go for a threesome where there is no penetration  for example  or in the contrary she might not be comfortable with piv at all and only want feminine contact it all depends   do nt stress too much for now  give yourself time  and you will be fine  ,d00s82w,sex,lifestyle,1455555004.0,LV1016,72.0,0.0,2094,2297,0.0
if you re feeling terrified and full of dread  do not go along with it stop where you are continue to talk about it continue to fantasize about it or role play with it  but do not actually do anything until you can think about it  without  being terrifiedfull of dread that way lies trouble  and it is  okay  if you are  never  comfortable with actually having a threesome  and note that there s a difference between being scarednervousanxious  kind of like the feeling you get before going on a roller coaster or going into an interview  and feeling like doom and gloom is going to descend on you if you do something  the thing with a threesome is  if everybody s going to play with everyone else  eg it s a triangle  not a v   then it s a positive if everyone  wants  everyone else  it s about everyone sexually enjoying everyone else if that s not something you can see yourself wanting or being okay with  then this may not be for you at the very least  it may not be something to jump into head first  i say that  because your thoughtsfeelingsreactions can shift over time  if you do  eventually  decide to engage in a threesome  understand that there s always the possibility that your boyfriend will pay more attention to the third party  even if it s not on purpose this does nt mean he does nt love and want you  but newnessit s exciting  you might even find yourself paying more attention to your guest than your boyfriend  in any kind of group encounter  you have to be willing and able to speak up and say  hey  can i get a little attention here   or  you need to have a nonverbal signal with your partner that tells him  i m feeling a little left out  or  slow down  you can also negotiate some things being  off the menu  for your first time out you say you changed your boundary from him not having piv sex with the third to him not coming inside her is that something you want  or were you just trying to make him happy  if it s the latter  you may need to revisit that boundary  bottom line  if you re not comfortable with something  do nt do it and do nt negotiate it if you decide you want to engage in a threesome at some point  find a middle ground with your boyfriend talk your boundaries death make a rule that if either one of you wants to quit  at any time  that you quit  though please be respectful to your third partner should you quit in the middle of things  and do nt act on anything if you feel that dread ,d010x4k,sex,lifestyle,1455567588.0,sangetencre,25.0,0.0,1,1337,0.0

in a threesome involving a couple with another girl  it s fairly common for the guy to focus more on the guest it s not always a conscious act  but the fact that its new and exciting he can often get carried away without realizing i ve read many posts not unlike yours where the girl is expressing her dissatisfaction with her guy doing this  but often she will say she started to feel left out and so sat by and just watched if you feel he starts to neglect you a bit  put yourself right in there and make him pay attention pull his penis out of her and physically put it in yourself or something  remind him that you are there too ,d00sami,sex,lifestyle,1455555111.0,kinkitup4u,29.0,0.0,915,16091,0.0

before doing anything outside your comfort zone  it s always a good idea to communicate really really clearly about expectations talk about it  and then talk about it some more it does nt have to be tedious  it can be sexy fantasizing together  a threesome especially has great potential for awkwardness because it s an odd number third wheel  is a phrase for a reason  something that might help to consider  what do you want the dynamic of the threesome to feel like  possibilities   you and the bf focus on the other girl  sort of team up to pleasure her  bf and the other girl focus on you  you and the other girl focus on bf maybe you guys rotate between all these dynamics  sex  really  any interaction between people  always has a dyadic component that is  when it comes down to it  there is always an interaction happening between two people in a twosome  it s always the same two in a threesome  it switches around  and you ll have multiple twosomes happening at the same time  in sex particularly  one partner is always doing something to the other partner ie at the barest level  person a touches person b in a certain way and produces certain sensations it feels twoway if person b then reciprocates  or does something to person a at the same time in a twosome  both partners can always be simultaneously doing something to each other  it s a little harder to focus on two people simultaneously  so in a threesome  the reciprocity is not as straightforward  this might be getting way too abstract anyway  go back to the possibilities and think about which one you would be most comfortable with see if that helps ,d01fl9w,sex,lifestyle,1455590125.0,FierceCrayon,3.0,0.0,1,21,0.0

a thread here got me thinking about something i just realized i ve never thought to ask before when my wife and i have piv sex  we do the usual inoutinout about a quarter of the time  and the other 34 we grind against each other s pelvises  for her the grinding simulates her clit and deepspot  for me it s twofold it feels like she s either milking me or gnashing the tip of my penis hard against the end of her vagina now  that second sensation is only possible because my cock is slightly longer than her pussy is deep there s about a quarter of an inch of shaft that either does nt go in  or if it does  it s because my penis is slightly bent inside her if she was half an inch deeper  this sensation would be completely gone  i know because i ve had exes that were deeper  now  on to my question when you  or your partner  grinds is there a sense of  completeness   for lack of better terms  if the penis is slightly larger than what the vagina can fully engulf  or conversely  is there a sense of lacking if the opposite were the case ,464l4y,sex,lifestyle,1455656698.0,WayneCider,1.0,0.0,1,553,0.0

long story short  i ve been dating a girl for nearly three months christmas evening was the first time we had sex  i kinda fucked it up by being to rough in the beginning  but we did nt had any problems we experience right now we talked about it  it s alright and we both acknowledged we still have a lot to explore and experience together since then we tried to have sex several times  but the following problems started to occur   i had a boner the entire foreplay  but when i m done with going down on her and we want to have sex my dick goes into malfunction and ca nt get it up  happened twice    at three points during foreplay while she was giving me a bjhj i just felt i lost control over my dick and felt like i could ejaculate instantly  edit  these points feels like my dick takes own control and i just can not make it relax or regain the control  my stamina is nt the greatest  but the more sex i have the better it becomes last summer i went from 105 kg to 85  i still go to the gym 5 times a week but i drinkeat what i want  still healthy  but no strict schedules anymore   so i do nt feel physically insecure i m not confident either  but i m happy the way i look muscular with a lil bit of fat so i feel like it cant be my physical insecurity  before i started dating her i had a relationship for 3 years with a girl that literally destroyed me from the inside out in the end i was able to cut myself loose  but the sex with her was without emotions  passion or anything related to love perhaps that was how i acted on christmas evening  i m thinking that the difference of sex could be the cause  besides that  i m also in my last year of my bachelor degree i was supposed to start my internship the first of february  but did nt make it due to an accident on work in my 2nd year  so i missed a lot of stuff it s kinda stressing me out i m really fed up with college  and i just want to ace my internship and get that degree i really feel stressed because of this i ca nt  or i do nt even know how to relax anymore it s on a regular basis on my daily mind  she is really open and acceptant towards it during valentine i surprised her and i made it really romantic but after hours of kissing  talking and foreplay both events started to occur we talked about it and she is really open to ideas  suggestions or solutions  also  i really love her we had several fun dates before i invited her to my house on christmas eve  i like to talk a lot with people before bonding with them she had the same she loves me too so you could say things might work out for us i really want to know how i can solve this  since i ve never experienced this before halp ,4625a4,sex,lifestyle,1455624079.0,Martiaz,8.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

you do nt want to ask her to stop  but it s hindering sex for you and so  i d assume  that means you want it to stop  you ca nt really have both  if she s not ready for it  that s understandable obviously it s a fantasy of hers and this is the closest she s comfortable getting right now  but  if it s turning you off and making sex feel fake or forced  it s totally acceptable and understandable to talk to her and ask her to tone it down  you can always try and get over that feeling she s trying to share a fantasy with you and make it sexy for you both maybe focus on the aspects that are arousing to you  and play on those when you re in the moment guide her with dirty talk of your own and make it into a role play that is hot for you both it may not be on the table to act it out anytime soon  but that does nt mean you ca nt have some fun with it in a way that enhances sex for you both  you guys obviously have open communication where sex is concerned  to be able to talk about threesomes and work out boundaries is a big step for a lot of couples  so this should be no different  sit down and let her know how you feel you like when she talks dirty  so reaffirm that you enjoy it and find it hot  boost her confidence  let her know it is nt her that s  ruining  sex for you  but let her know how you feel about certain subject matters  as gently or bluntly as you need it to be  and find a way to work her fantasy and your needs into sex equally maybe she reserves that kind of fantasy talk for certain times  and does nt bring it out all the time maybe you guys do certain types of role play surrounding that fantasy on certain occasions so she can fulfill that but you do nt have to think about it all the time  maybe you guys can chat about and come up with ways to make it more sexy and enticing for you  even  for couples that do nt share certain fantasies  compromise is a pretty reasonable request and is nt uncommon saving certain types of play and fantasy for certain nights  so everyone gets what they enjoy and it does nt become stale or constant  is a pretty decent proposal  if it is nt something you think you can get into and get over  i d bring it up with her ,d02i92t,sex,lifestyle,1455664167.0,TheDingalingus,1.0,0.0,14,4676,0.0

my so and i have a group of close longtime friends that we hang out with almost every weekend we are three committed malefemale couples in our early twenties recently  there has been underlying sexual tension in the group that no one will openly admit to the other night  we all got drunk and insisted we play strip poker after some initial reluctance  we all ended up losing our clothes and became increasingly comfortable after we finished the game  there was some awkward  now what   conversation we instinctively moved on to truth or dare the whole game was a series of dares consisting of  lick this  bite that  kiss her   all the while beating around the bush everyone was clearly enjoying themselves and having a good time  here s where the problem is by the time we were done  it was 5 in the goddamn morning and i was sober  but everyone else was still drunk then one of the couples suggested we draw straws for  sleeping arrangements  in threesomes in separate bedrooms it was a  whatever happens happens  type of deal the idea of separating couples and possibly taking advantage of my drunk friends set off a few alarms we have also seen a few issues of jealousy and loyalty come up with each of the couples over the years my so and i told everyone we were sober and we did nt feel comfortable with the current situation  but we were adamant that we had fun  everyone was definitely interested in taking things further  and my so and i found the idea of it very exciting would it be completely out of the question to act further on this  we still do nt think splitting up is a good idea  but would group sex be a good way to break this escalated tension  or will continuing down this road sour our friendships ,45zpfc,sex,lifestyle,1455581860.0,5intheGoddamnMorning,48.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

one practical option is to have him give you oral beforehand and then start intercourse right away as soon as you orgasm that way the pressure is off to some extent because you already came and are very turned on when it starts works well unless you are someone who does nt like intercourse right after orgasm  some women seem to love it and others not   if you do nt like it then he could stop just before you climax and come on in ,d01ay8k,sex,lifestyle,1455582800.0,PopeyeKhan,20.0,0.0,1,691,0.0
my gf has had a lowered libido for a long time now and we are both interested in trying to get it back to where it was during the first year of our relationship any advice is appreciated  more info  i asked her for permission to ask this on reddit  eventhough it is anonymous  and she it more than interested in hearing any possible advice sorry for the incoherent rant that follows  our relationship was strained for such a long time  arguing once every few days  having almost no sex  maybe once a month or less at times  that we actually broke up after a few days i wanted to get back together and try and make it work by addressing the things that she had said were making her crazy  most of which having to do with me being lazy in one way or another we also talked about our poor sex life and i told her that sex is very important to me  but i was nt going to pressure her to have sex until she was more comfortable with me and trusting her libido in the first year of our relationship was incredibly high  higher than mine for sure she actually cites the fact that i would turn her down too often as a reason for her decline in libido she also switched her birth control from the pill  yaz  i think  to nuvaring anyway  we ve been back together for about a week now and we ve had sex twice the first time was after a few drinks and unfortunately she admitted to the alcohol being a factor even though it was only 2 or 3 drinks the second time was today  and she told me that she was nt incredibly interested initially and was doing it more for me she always claims to have a great time and orgasms every time  but she is never in the mood before hand and would never initiate i often worry that maybe i m coming onto her too often and that maybe wanting to make out often puts her off or is annoying we have an incredibly open line of communication since getting back together  and we talk about how things are going at least once a day to make sure there are nt anythings unsaid or desires left unclear  i know that letting her build her libido again  if that s possible  is going to take time so i do nt want to rush it  but i just want to make sure we are on the right track  and find things we can do or try to increase her sex drive i ve also stressed the importance of not wanting her to feel like she needs to give me sex  but at the same time how sex is an important issue in a relationship and she agrees she wants a higher libido and for us to get back to our old ways when things were good ,460rjg,sex,lifestyle,1455596652.0,Throwaderp2,45.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

you could try edging basically stimulate him  suckfuckwank be creative  for a set time eg 15 mins get him close to cumming  then stop everything just before he cums and i mean stop everything you both can not touch his cock until he does nt want to cum anymore after the 15 mins he can cum then as he gets better at it try to increase the time from 15 mins to 23 hours  it sounds horrible but learning how to edge helps me last longer i can keep going as long as needed then cum when i m sure she s had just about enough always leave them wanting more  aka finishing before the chaffing starts  as you get better at edging is all you have to do is stop thrusting for awhile or change positions  maybe if i m getting a bj i ll go down on her or say i want to fuck and the feeling eventually passes  i promise you he will thank you for showing him how to edge the orgasms are bigger  stronger and more intense after edging for 2 or 3 hours ,d01wrom,sex,lifestyle,1455633896.0,fleckofly,1.0,0.0,1,118,0.0

hi there so this probably seems like a shallow issue to have  but i want to get some other people opinions i m 18 and my girlfriend s 19  we ve been together for 4 months and things are going great we ve never argued  are honest about our feelings with each other and are in love   heads up  lots of detail  i just have one issue and that is that i go down on my gf a reasonable amount  at least a couple times a week sometimes even twice in 24 hours but she hardly touches my penis telling me penises are weird  now i understand that everyone feels differently about giving and receiving but i just feel as if this is a bit selfish of her i mean  we re both virgins  and its our first serious relationship each  but she gets to reach orgasm with my tongue in her vagina and i get told my anatomy is weird vaginas are weird too  at first she said that she thought oral and using hands on each others genitals was disconnecting that excuse disappeared when i started licking her out she s happy to let me go down there with her uncut pubes  but the one time she attempted to give me hand job she just stared at the ceiling and made a face and then decided she did nt like it and stopped  i m quite a selfless person  and i find it hard to ask for this stuff  but yknow i feel as if there s a real imbalance here i ll give her oral without a second thought because i know she enjoys it  but if i ask for anything i get told maybe later i feel as if i put a lot more effort into this part of the relationship than she does  and more than she realises  i do plan to be honest with her how i feel  but i m not sure how to approach the issue or what i can suggest i feel as if i d have more luck suggesting to have sex than for anything in return  so there you have it  thanks for reading my anecdote  i appreciate it looking forward to what you guys have to say ,465cqd,sex,lifestyle,1455666581.0,Lukai-9,8.0,0.0,1,42,0.0

hello  have not ever posted to this subreddit but the more time goes on the more this issue is bothering me my boyfriend and i have a great relationship and i am very very sexually attracted to him he says he feels the same for me and sometimes i believe him because he is generally the one who initiates and sometimes even gets hard from brushing up against me when we are out places he is always telling me i am beautiful and he loves me but there is one big issue that leads me to believe he is nt sexually attracted to me the way i am to him  btw forgot to add this but we have been together 1 year 3 months we live together and i am 25 yr old and he is 32  we have sex often upwards of 5 times a week and the only way he can finish is by masturbating at the end on my face on or my chest while i dirty talk to him or moan when we do this he cums within a minute he says he is always close but just ca nt finish unless he does it he has cum inside of me quite a few times but he goes through spells where he will cum in me maybe 56times a month then go 3 months without cumming in me at all and when he has cum inside me the only way he can do that is from behind and once from the side and trying to get him to cum orally or with my hands is impossible it makes me feel utterly pathetic he says its something wrong with him not me but to me that just cant be right all my other boyfriends or men that i ve been with cum nearly instantly the first 15 times we have sex and after that they usually came within 10 minutes i just dont understand why i cant do that with the man i love  he can please me repeatedly without my help and i cant do anything to please him it eats away at me and his answer to it is that hes cum with me more than any other girl hes been with and hes never been able to cum from oral my boyfriend has had threesomes and orgies and been with hundreds of women while he was in the military this is just hard for me to believe that he ca nt cum  there has to be something wrong with me i have researched handjob and oral videos on how to do it better and he reacts to my new techniques well but i know him and he never even gets close from anything i do to him he insists it feels good and that i should nt worry so much about him going but he gets irritated if he ca nt make me cum  its a frustrating situation because i cant talk with him too much about it or it causes him even more performance anxiety so  i know this was alot of ranting but is this because of me not being sexually attractive enough to him or something else ,464nvd,sex,lifestyle,1455657656.0,latenightreads,1.0,0.0,3,222,0.0

do a google search for  death grip  he probably masturbates with too much force and littleno lube  and thus his penis is not sensitive enough to get off to anything but his own hand in most cases this is really common  he s had this problem with all of his partners you ve never had this problem before it s obvious that the issue is with him  and he s  told  you it s with him take a look at the orgasm troubles section of the faq and search death grip in the subreddit or on google if he wants to work on the problem  perhaps gently suggest some of the solutions that you find there ,d02dte1,sex,lifestyle,1455657983.0,laidymondegreen,1.0,0.0,4024,100160,0.0
hey there  i ve been having a slight burning urination when i pee that kind of comes and goes once a week  plus a terrible odor has been emitting from down there it all looks fine  and i even saw a doctor and did a urine test for chlamydia and gonnorhea  which i m ecstatic to say i do not have he also checked me  and said there were no signs of anything out of the ordinary  however  the problems have continued to persist upon redditing and researching  i realised that it s highly likely i may have a male version of thrush  as the symptoms of slight discomfort and smell have appeared  others have said it might be diet  but my diet has nt altered that radically lately others have suggested it s due to poor foreskin cleanliness and maintenance  but i keep things pretty clean  and have still never had an odour persist this badly in my entire life after i clean thoroughly  the smell goes away  but immediately comes back after urination it seems plus  the whole slight burning thing every now and then is a huge sign  too  i know there s a pill canesoral  fluconazole  that you can buy over the counter that s generally an antifungal for female thrush  but i was wondering if men could also take this ,466mqq,sex,lifestyle,1455684644.0,mysterynothing,1.0,0.0,1,31,0.0

so we ve been together a year and it s my first sexual relationship it s fun  it feels good  i always want sex  and he s majorly caring  boxes ticked but i absolutely can not cum during  oral  handjobs  penetration  anything  when i m by myself i masturbate and come to a finish by  lying on my back  closing my eyes  rubbing my clit area  thinking about sex  sometimes quite kinky things  which do lack in the bedroom it s easy  and i can cum more than once  up to five times in a row so everything works haha  my partner makes me feel even better during any type of sex despite ever climaxing  everything he does to me is nearly overwhelming with how good it feels i try very hard to relax and focus on the stimulation and allowing it to bring a climax  but i get stopped literally seconds away from cumming and i do not know why it is my main sex dream to cum together at the same time so it s not like i do nt want this it does nt help that i have a bit of a dryness problem either because it is hard to last more than 25 minutes comfortable during sex  not only is this leading me to be sexually frustrated and often feeling slightly annoyed and unfinished after any sort of sexual occurrence  i think my partners confidence has taken a blow he seems to think because he can not make me cum he is nt good at sex  and while i m a virgin and know he is definitely not bad at this  really think getting over this will help our relationship  i need advice on orgasming through new methods  new positions  and getting used to someone else being able to make me climax please please please give any advice if you think it will help me  tl  dr  can not cum at all with partner  and it is causing me frustration and him feelings of inadequacy,4657dg,sex,lifestyle,1455664439.0,sexyeducation,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

my so and i have a group of close longtime friends that we hang out with almost every weekend we are three committed malefemale couples in our early twenties recently  there has been underlying sexual tension in the group that no one will openly admit to the other night  we all got drunk and insisted we play strip poker after some initial reluctance  we all ended up losing our clothes and became increasingly comfortable after we finished the game  there was some awkward  now what   conversation we instinctively moved on to truth or dare the whole game was a series of dares consisting of  lick this  bite that  kiss her   all the while beating around the bush everyone was clearly enjoying themselves and having a good time  here s where the problem is by the time we were done  it was 5 in the goddamn morning and i was sober  but everyone else was still drunk then one of the couples suggested we draw straws for  sleeping arrangements  in threesomes in separate bedrooms it was a  whatever happens happens  type of deal the idea of separating couples and possibly taking advantage of my drunk friends set off a few alarms we have also seen a few issues of jealousy and loyalty come up with each of the couples over the years my so and i told everyone we were sober and we did nt feel comfortable with the current situation  but we were adamant that we had fun  everyone was definitely interested in taking things further  and my so and i found the idea of it very exciting would it be completely out of the question to act further on this  we still do nt think splitting up is a good idea  but would group sex be a good way to break this escalated tension  or will continuing down this road sour our friendships ,45zpfc,sex,lifestyle,1455581860.0,5intheGoddamnMorning,48.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

i  23 f  recently discovered that i can squirt my bf enjoys it a lot and makes me squirt repeatedly around 20 times sometimes however  the intensity of the enjoyment changes a lot from time to time  sometimes feels like an orgasm sometimes not on some occasions  after squirting maybe 10 times  i get a very intense orgasmlike feeling that makes me very high but i really want to know if that s a vaginal orgasm or just a nice feeling caused by squirting a lot can some of you experienced people tell me the difference between a very pleasurable squirting and a vaginal orgasm  or at least share how it feels for you  edit  i have to mention that i ve never had a vaginal orgasm separately from squirting  if that feeling is a vo the thing is  during penetration the nice feeling starts to build up and if i start pushing my genital muscles against it  almost like giving birth to a baby  i squirt on the other hand  if i do nt push  nothing happens  the feeling just builds up  making me crazy  but i do nt orgasm if anyone finds this familiar  i would appreciate some advise on how to have a vaginal o without squirting ,4636dy,sex,lifestyle,1455639828.0,WaddlesThePing,5.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

personally  they do nt do anything in particular for me  and they d be a bit of a downside during a blowjob but there are likely lots of women who feel exactly the opposite i d avoid trying to boost your self esteem on only one characteristic  because if you end up with a partner who is nt interested or even finds it to be a turnoff  then you ll take a blow to your confidence  and that s definitely something to be avoided ,d02pb6h,sex,lifestyle,1455675083.0,laidymondegreen,2.0,0.0,4024,100160,0.0

well i ve experienced plenty of vaginal orgasms and i ve squirted a few times for me there s quite a huge difference i can tell if i m gon na squirt or not and it is nt actually the most comfortable feeling a normal vaginal orgasm has a nice build up and then a pretty big climax depending on the stimulation for me but when i m about to squirt it s a much more intense feeling  i ca nt really even sit still it s like my body is trying to enjoy it but it s a bit too much for it to take this usually happens if i have stimulation directly on my clit and when that s happening i do nt always cum for me it can be hard to even tell if i did just bc of the intensity of squirting kinda masks it for awhile i was nt sure if i was in fact just cumming at the same time as squirting but i recently realized that if i often do nt have that high  worn out  limp feeling you get after an orgasm usually once i ve squirted i still feel like i could be stimulated more to actually get to orgasm hope that helps a little ,d021etg,sex,lifestyle,1455641224.0,sexkitten20,5.0,0.0,1,4,0.0

i read this on rsexover30 it s a little info everyone who has a partner with a v should know gt  i ve had someone use suction and  while it was an interesting  arousing sensation  it was nt going to make me come i learned how to give cunnilingus from a woman  and i ve only been with 3 women  but they all did it the same way  so i think of it as how girls eat pussy   even though other women must do it differently it s striking to me that guys do different stuff  but these women all did the same thing  gt  it makes me come i ve never had a man do it like this  and i rarely come from cunnilingus with a man  i ve been with one man who easily makes me orgasm from cunnilingus  but he does something different and much more complicated than this  gt  start with some licking and kissing  but once you get to the point where she s excited and wants to orgasm  press your lower jaw firmly into her pussy  with the flat upper part of the tongue against her clit you can keep going a long time without getting tired because you do nt use the strength of your tongue for pressure  you use your jaw  which is really strong the woman who s receiving determines the amount of pressure by how hard she thrusts into your face you press back the same amount  gt  nod your head in rhythm with how she moves her pelvis put two fingers in her pussy and stroke the front wall  in the same rhythm  gt  when she gets ready to come  she bucks her pelvis hard and fast against your mouth you may have to let her rub herself against your lower lip and chin instead of tongue  to keep from scraping with teeth  gt  see what i mean  really simple now that i write this  i wonder whether i could teach a guy to do it to me ,d02g8b3,sex,lifestyle,1455661240.0,terwini,4.0,0.0,221,462,0.0

so on valentine s day we wanted to watch a sexy film and after googling a bit we decided to watch love  the film involves a couple who has loads of nice sex  who then decide to have a threesome with their new sexy neighbour  me and my boyfriend have been talking about having a threesome with another girl for a while we have discussed our limits  at first him not doing piv  eventually changing to him not cuming inside of her   this was mostly to satisfy his fantasy and for me to explore something i ve been interested in trying for a while  now after watching that scene which starts very hot but ends up with the guy paying much more attention to the other girl i feel so terrified because it i imagined my boyfriend enjoying fucking some other girl like that and i just started crying after the scene i had this horrible pit in my stomach and felt so emotional this is something that would have turned me on so much before when i was single  he was amazing about it  comforted me  and even mentioned before i could say anything that he thought too much time was spent on the other girl i trust him completely we went to a strip club once where they payed a lot of attention to me and i even encouraged them to pay attention to him as well i was fine with that but the thought of him wanting  desiring another girl freaks me out completely he has watched chatturbate while we were having sex a couple of times and i keep worrying that he wants someone else  what should i do  should i go along with it and hope that i will be okay with it  like the strip club  or put a stop to it  i love him so much and i want to make this happen for him  but that scene wo nt get out of my head ,45x9eh,sex,lifestyle,1455553813.0,Throwawaythrsm,447.0,0.0,1,153,0.0

you may not be ready for it to happen i m feeling like you have some insecurities about either yourself or the relationship and adding another female to that situation may not be the best idea  in my experiences with group sex  i ve met women who felt the same way as you that i would leave them for the other woman or something the big thing i suggest for you  it to trust your man if you love him as much as you do and he feels the same about you  then you should nt have anything to worry about yes  he is a man and he will enjoy the other woman very much it will be a new experience for him and he will take a lot of pleasure from it and may often think about it afterwards when he masturbates but you need to realize he is your man he is coming home to you he is with you every night you are the woman in his life if you can find it in you to allow him the pleasure of two women  and enjoy it yourself of course  then know he will still be yours after the threesome it will only be a momentary pleasure for the two of you but before you can do it  you need to be confident in yourself that you know where your man lays every night  and that you are the woman he is with every night the other woman wo nt mean anything  or should nt mean anything to him after the threesome  if your love and relationship are solid enough ,d00rvuh,sex,lifestyle,1455554487.0,tattooedandpierced,3.0,0.0,1,806,0.0

my  22f  boyfriend  23m  of 7 months got the results of his most recent lab work today and found out that he has hsv1 based on my last testing  done in december of last year  i don  t have it  but i do plan on getting testing again soon despite me telling him that it  s very common and that the symptoms are not always severe  he believes that his life is over as he knows it he feels that he  ll never be able to have a regular relationship  get married  have kids  etc many of the things he wanted to do prior to receiving the diagnosis  i am still interested in being with him  but he  s really worried about transmitting it to me i told him that it  s still possible to engage in activities with the diagnosis and that just because one partner has it  the other one is not guaranteed to get it and maybe this sounds na  ve  but even if i were to get it  in my opinion herpes is basically a skin condition that may or may not flare up that is usually otherwise benign in other words  though i would not like to not get it  it would not be the end of the world if i did also  because it is so common  i feel like even if i don  t get it from him  there  s a fair chance that i could get it in the future  am i being na  ve  is he being overly dramatic  or is it a combination of the two  what should i tell him  also  he plans to get retested and i plan to get tested again this week  edit 1  he was diagnosed via blood test for igg antibodies tl  dr boyfriend recently diagnosed with hsv1  feels life is over,465fqv,sex,lifestyle,1455667737.0,ilikepretezels,0.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

you definitely have a much more mature and objective way of looking at the situation that being said  his emotional response is understandable too time heals all with this situation keep being caring and understanding as you have been  and eventually he ll calm down and understand that there s nothing that he can do at this point but make the best of his situation symptoms can be controlled pretty well  and as you ve said  it s fairly common in today s world encourage him  and also yourself  to learn as much as you can about the possible effects it can have on other aspects of your reproductive health  and get as many actual  real world  statistics as possible to support or negate concerns over those complications ,d02kxoc,sex,lifestyle,1455668427.0,NeroK96,2.0,0.0,1,293,0.0

did he have genital lesions or is he just going off of a blood antibody screen  hsv1 is most commonly associated with cold sores  although occasionally presents genitally in the us  more than half of all people screened for hsv1 test positive and it is assumed the actual prevalence is more along the lines of 7080  because it s not usually tested for unless it s causing complications beyond a simple cold sore  i have hsv1 and i get a cold sore maybe once every 23 years my partner has hsv1 genitally  and has had roughly one outbreak a year since he was diagnosed at 19  he s 34 now  he s been in many relationships  including with me and i like to think i m normal   he was married  he has two kids  and it has never been a concern or a barrier to him doing those things it s really a minor inconvenience that he has to get an ointment every couple of years to shorten the duration of the lesion it s usually a tiny one about the size of a mosquito bite that s not painful and only minimally itchy ,d02nx5r,sex,lifestyle,1455672972.0,ala1985,2.0,0.0,1,5056,0.0
i  23 f  recently discovered that i can squirt my bf enjoys it a lot and makes me squirt repeatedly around 20 times sometimes however  the intensity of the enjoyment changes a lot from time to time  sometimes feels like an orgasm sometimes not on some occasions  after squirting maybe 10 times  i get a very intense orgasmlike feeling that makes me very high but i really want to know if that s a vaginal orgasm or just a nice feeling caused by squirting a lot can some of you experienced people tell me the difference between a very pleasurable squirting and a vaginal orgasm  or at least share how it feels for you  edit  i have to mention that i ve never had a vaginal orgasm separately from squirting  if that feeling is a vo the thing is  during penetration the nice feeling starts to build up and if i start pushing my genital muscles against it  almost like giving birth to a baby  i squirt on the other hand  if i do nt push  nothing happens  the feeling just builds up  making me crazy  but i do nt orgasm if anyone finds this familiar  i would appreciate some advise on how to have a vaginal o without squirting ,4636dy,sex,lifestyle,1455639828.0,WaddlesThePing,5.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
well i ve experienced plenty of vaginal orgasms and i ve squirted a few times for me there s quite a huge difference i can tell if i m gon na squirt or not and it is nt actually the most comfortable feeling a normal vaginal orgasm has a nice build up and then a pretty big climax depending on the stimulation for me but when i m about to squirt it s a much more intense feeling  i ca nt really even sit still it s like my body is trying to enjoy it but it s a bit too much for it to take this usually happens if i have stimulation directly on my clit and when that s happening i do nt always cum for me it can be hard to even tell if i did just bc of the intensity of squirting kinda masks it for awhile i was nt sure if i was in fact just cumming at the same time as squirting but i recently realized that if i often do nt have that high  worn out  limp feeling you get after an orgasm usually once i ve squirted i still feel like i could be stimulated more to actually get to orgasm hope that helps a little ,d021etg,sex,lifestyle,1455641224.0,sexkitten20,5.0,0.0,1,4,0.0

sounds to me like the safest option is to simply not have a threesome however  if the idea is stil lurking around for you after a while i must stress that porn is way  way different from real life  those pornstars are not in a relationship and the male in the porn can fuck or desire whoever he wants without a second thought  your boyfriend on the otherhand seems to know full well that he s in a commited relationship and will likely respect that way differently from an emotionally disconnected pornstar ,d017uz9,sex,lifestyle,1455577843.0,clashbuster,5.0,0.0,246,22046,0.0
ok  i think we can all agree that you are one person who is _not_ ready for a threesome maybe you will be someday  but i would nt bet on it do nt worry about it  lots of people do nt like threesomes  however  i want you to think about something  you are so insecure about yourself that just considering a _fictional_ situation wherein you are not the center of attention brings you tears  you can avoid threesomes of course  and i would recommend you do so  but this level of neurosis is not good for you you are just torturing yourself  i would suggest you consider therapy ,d01i564,sex,lifestyle,1455594172.0,pole_imposition,0.0,0.0,1,917,0.0

i m a male 23 year old virgin  but for some reason i almost never have any sex dreams and the few i have had are always terrible mainly because while sex is present in the dream it s never me having sex  because even in my dreams i m still rejected by the ladies  and the few dreams i have had where i m close to having sex nothing materializes as the dream changes into a nightmare before anything  amp  nbsp  anyway i ve become interested in lucid dreaming  thought it would be cool to be able to have sex in my dreams since it s not like it s going to happen in reallife  so after trying a few techniques for awhile i got some success last night was a bit different i actually got to have a sex dream though it was nt what i wanted so i was wondering why do i have such dreams  what could my dream i had last night mean  anyway it goes like this  amp  nbsp  so the dream starts off as an alien abduction  a light comes through my window and somehow beams me onto an alien ship where i immediately notice i m in some sort of surgical room with a bright light shining on my face  lying on a table with these stereotypical short  grey  like aliens standing over me wearing blue jumpsuits and equipped with various surgical tools  at first i m about to panic in fear  but then i decide to calmly assess the situation that s when i realize i m dreaming as i tell my self this ca nt be real as i notice a few absurdities in the dream  i get up ignoring the aliens and just yell out  sweet  i m being abducted by aliens in my dream   i m super excited at this point because since it s my dream i can rewrite reality so i choose to float around exploring the ship amazed at the incredible architecture i find i come up with a plan involving me spending my dream time exploring the galaxy in a cool starship filled with sexy alien girl harem  i know i m a nerd   unfortunately the moment i try to create the girls i wake up  amp  nbsp  after waking i realize i ve only slept for a few hours so i have plenty of time to go back to bed before work so i go back to sleep to continue my dream and hopefully have sex  amp  nbsp  strangely this time in the dream i notice i m naked and i ca nt see at all as i feel hands rubbing all over my body and a sensation of being carried  i realize i m dreaming so i m not worried but i wish i had some light to see what s going on  suddenly i notice lit torches appear around me providing some light and i see that i m in some sort of underground crypt and to my horror surrounded by rotting corpses and the creatures touching and carrying me are zombiesghouls  and skeletons  and i ca nt break free from their grasp  worse yet standing in front of me is a  female   http  oi64tinypiccom2dumrs6jpg   lich   http  wwwsanthariacompicturesfaugarfaugar_picslich1jpg  with glowing white eyes wearing tattered royal robes and a golden crown  amp  nbsp  i try to change the dream  like changing the scenery  changing the lich to a beautiful woman  removing the zombies  etc but nothing works the lich is too powerful and i find myself completely unable to change the dream the lich begins caressing me  licking me  and telling me how i want her and i m just in a state of shock  horror  and strangely some arousal  she also attempts to do some sort of sexy dance and tries to twerk which looks really strange considering she looks like a walking anorexic corpse  after her little dance she sings a few lyrics from   post to be    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  apxvscfoynu   which actually does nt sound half bad  ending with her going up to my ear whispering  if you want me to expose the freak  you got ta eat the booty like groceries  and i m like  wtf    she just ignores me pulls off her dress and tries to sit her undead ass on my face luckily i wake up  amp  nbsp  i try to clear my head and go back to bed hoping i get to have a sexy dream this time  after going back to sleep i try to imagine myself with a beautiful woman  but instead i m back with the lich trapped again this time she asks me why i m rejecting her and then she tells me she thinks i m gay and then with a wave of her hands summons a massive undead minotaur into the room and tells me something along the lines of the minotaur can  keep me company  as it slowly marches towards me as tentacles begin ripping out of it s rotting body i try to tell her i m not gay and definitely not interested in be ripped apart by some giant minotaur but she ignores me  not wanting to have some gay rape dream  i bail  immediately waking up at this point i m pretty annoyed and i just want to sleep so i can go to work in the morning so i go back to bed hoping just to have some peaceful rest  amp  nbsp  strangely i m back with the lich again  i create a giant explosion of light to incinerate her and her undead slaves while many of the undead disintegrate she remains completely unfazed  does nt react in any noticeable way  by this as innumerable undead surround me and then wrestle me to the ground  she disintegrates my clothing and summons her undead minotaur as her minions try to force me to  assume the position  not wanting this dream to get really really gay and painful i give up and lie to her telling her she is incredibly beautiful and that i ve always desired her  happy with this she tells her minions to stand down and we embrace and havesex which actually felt pretty good just dryand coldyeahwoke up feeling pretty dirty after that  nasty stuff  amp  nbsp    tl  dr    i have a lucid dream which gets hijacked by some

if you are not 100  comfortable  please do not i had a threesome once and it was such a painful experience circumstances were different  but it was still me and a guy i had deep feelings for  my now husband actually  and another girl and it sucked hard it was actually the first time we ever slept together i liked him so  so much  but he was in a fwb thing with another girl we got drunk and spin the bottle lead to you know i thought i could handle it  but there i was with this person i was developing these intense feelings for and he was inside another girl  right next to me my heart was broken obviously  we ended up married so it was nt the end of the world  but it still hurt like hell  you mentioned in another comment that he deserves it because of how awesome he is no you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your life  relationship and sex life and if he does nt understand that  then he does nt deserve you but i would be willing to bet  if you told him your feelings and apprehensions he would probably never mention it again at least not until you feel more comfortable and bring it up again just my two cents though,d01l3o3,sex,lifestyle,1455599401.0,jaxxattacks,3.0,0.0,551,1993,0.0

before  definitely good  during and after can be disguisting if you use normal condoms without flavor since these normal condoms just do nt taste and smell like anything you want to be cloth to you mouth best way to fix this is usung flavored condoms or go bareback sometimes the dried up female fluid around her pussy might not be that inviting to eat also  really depends on the level of the guys arousal  after bareback might turn off some guys because of their own cum however there are much more guys than one might expect who do nt mind licking their own cum  especially do nt mind if it comes out of her pussy this is mostly something that depends on the guys mood and how horny he is   edit  fixed spelling issues ,d02sogr,sex,lifestyle,1455680470.0,idfkagnn,1.0,0.0,1,-26,0.0

my girlfriend  24  f  has never had an orgasm and has not masturbated before  so i gave her a vibrator for her birthday so we can spice up our sex and hopefully help her achieve the o when we tried it  the vibrator is a clit stimulator   she would always end up laughing  saying it tickles when either i use it on her  or when she tries it on her own is the vibrator something she needs to get used to or are we not hitting the right spots ,4643fu,sex,lifestyle,1455650678.0,double_stripe,8.0,0.0,21,33,0.0
my couple of initial thoughts on troubleshooting this be to try it on top of underwear  as maybe it s a little too specific or intense or that the vibrator is more on the  buzzy  side and a more  rumbly  one could feel a better and just in case  make sure she s aroused  as lots of unaroused clits do nt like to be messed with ,d02cgxq,sex,lifestyle,1455656175.0,SexEdSteve,2.0,0.0,1824,3874,0.0

sounds like you re not using it right if she s not really aroused or the vibration is too pinpointed on one spot a lot of times i get that tickled feeling too you need to let her use the vibrator on her own to figure out exactly what she likes  probably in private  without you  and then she can show you for me its a combo of making little circle motions around my clit area with my legs kinda spaced apart pressing down on one spot or just shoving it down her pants is nt going to do much a lot of times if you re not doing it right it either tickles like crazy or if its directly on the clit it can be somewhat painful so just be careful if you re doing it to her let her completely figure it out and then show you my bf puts me on my stomach  ass up  and sits in between my legs and plays with it like that and it drives me to orgasm almost every single time figure out what she likes and do nt be afraid to try every single position  sometimes that detail is all it takes ,d02v7lz,sex,lifestyle,1455684960.0,sctaco,1.0,0.0,11467,88,0.0

my two favorite parts of my boyfriend s body that i could look at forever and find incredibly sexy  besides the d  would be his biceps and his butt dimples  his biceps because he could probably crush my skull with the crook of his arm  even though he is kinda selfconscious about how  small  they have evidently become  i love them to pieces   but i do nt think he believes me yet i ll keep reminding him  and i just think his butt dimples are cute i like to touch them nothing fancy here ,d02lgc7,sex,lifestyle,1455669209.0,kiwichampion,1.0,0.0,1,690,0.0

my gf has had a lowered libido for a long time now and we are both interested in trying to get it back to where it was during the first year of our relationship any advice is appreciated  more info  i asked her for permission to ask this on reddit  eventhough it is anonymous  and she it more than interested in hearing any possible advice sorry for the incoherent rant that follows  our relationship was strained for such a long time  arguing once every few days  having almost no sex  maybe once a month or less at times  that we actually broke up after a few days i wanted to get back together and try and make it work by addressing the things that she had said were making her crazy  most of which having to do with me being lazy in one way or another we also talked about our poor sex life and i told her that sex is very important to me  but i was nt going to pressure her to have sex until she was more comfortable with me and trusting her libido in the first year of our relationship was incredibly high  higher than mine for sure she actually cites the fact that i would turn her down too often as a reason for her decline in libido she also switched her birth control from the pill  yaz  i think  to nuvaring anyway  we ve been back together for about a week now and we ve had sex twice the first time was after a few drinks and unfortunately she admitted to the alcohol being a factor even though it was only 2 or 3 drinks the second time was today  and she told me that she was nt incredibly interested initially and was doing it more for me she always claims to have a great time and orgasms every time  but she is never in the mood before hand and would never initiate i often worry that maybe i m coming onto her too often and that maybe wanting to make out often puts her off or is annoying we have an incredibly open line of communication since getting back together  and we talk about how things are going at least once a day to make sure there are nt anythings unsaid or desires left unclear  i know that letting her build her libido again  if that s possible  is going to take time so i do nt want to rush it  but i just want to make sure we are on the right track  and find things we can do or try to increase her sex drive i ve also stressed the importance of not wanting her to feel like she needs to give me sex  but at the same time how sex is an important issue in a relationship and she agrees she wants a higher libido and for us to get back to our old ways when things were good ,460rjg,sex,lifestyle,1455596652.0,Throwaderp2,45.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
