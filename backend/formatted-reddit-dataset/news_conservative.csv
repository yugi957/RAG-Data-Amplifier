kasich is not leaving he is way too full of himself he must bring ohio to the federal level and solve all of our problems he also has realized he is the lefty pick from the republican field  so in each and every one of those  open  primary states  kasich sees himself picking up disaffected democrats who want to vote  none of the above  between the two democrats in the primaries now  rubio really thinks that his debate  performance  was only about repeating stump lines he just does nt get it he is wide open vulnerable on immigration  and there are only so many times he can shout down people who call him on it  spread lies about those calling him on it  and count on the public not checking his actual record on it  jeb  is the unabashed establishment dweeb in the race he is like bernie in that he is totally open about being an establishment schill he just does nt get how tired we are of bushes  and the government for sale rule of the establishment he may be more prudent and seasoned  but that does nt mean he is nt bought and paid for and branded the little bitch of the establishment  it is a tossup here will the voters give the same resounding  meh  for jeb  they have been  or will rubio s dance with immigration finally catch up to him and the public realize he is an open borders guy in conservative clothing  a thing even more contemptible than the out of closet establishment dweeb jeb  is  this piece seems to get that part right  that they are the most likely to fade to keep the establishment in power  ben s faith is strong  and he sees this race as a calling he will not leave easily unless the doors start closing  i think the other dynamic is trump v cruz if either left  the other would lock the nomination this is why trump keeps going for knockouts with utter garbage every debate on cruz so far evangelicals have not made their voice heard  and cruz is counting on that with the establishment dweebs still in the race  he must draw votes from trump cruz is pulling a mitt romney here  playing it safe rather than taking trump down remember when mitt backed off his first debate and played it safe with obama  that put him in the loser s bracket cruz s central challenge is finding a way to challenge trump on the basics and approaches without trump shouting him down ,d02amht,conservative,news,1455653766,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,d02dwhd,conservative,news,1455658094,wiseprogressivethink,1,0,137571,11206,0.0

in my opinion republicans will be playing an interesting gamble if they refuse to allow any obama appointee they could use their current leverage to force some sort of moderate swing voter now similar to how reagan got roberts through a democrat senate in his last year if not they are playing a gamble with the election senate and presidential results tend to be highly correlated so if they lose the presidency they are likely to lose the senate also this year at which point we will get a much more liberal justice of course they could also win the presidency  it all depends on how likely you think each of these outcomes are ,d025a9z,conservative,news,1455646582,jas07,2,0,51,5254,0.0

this is the difference between the liberal mindset and the sane  to liberals  money is a sign of how evil you are have a lot of money  must have swindled it from some unsuspecting poor victims  being poor is a sign of virtue to them  to the sane  its the opposite wealth is nt a static zero sum game wealth is created by helping others if you provide goods or services that others feel is of benefit to them  they give you little paper tokens in exchange for that good or service that says  hey  this dude helped me  and you can then exchange that token to get help from someone else that actually benefits you so wealth is a sign of helping others  of being a productive and constructive member of society the more money you ve earned  the more you ve helped people  if you re poor  and not the legitimate victim of some unfortunate catastrophic disease or accident  it s a sign that you have nt helped others either through youth and inexperience  laziness  poor decision making or intentional parasitism  bernie is not the victim of any legitimate catastrophic disease or accident he s certainly not young and inexperienced so his lack of wealth is do to what  laziness  poor decision making  or intentional parasitism ,d01iqbw,conservative,news,1455595122,IcarusGoodman,0,0,76,4893,0.0

as much as one would hope attacking trumps conservative bona fides would be effective  i think the rules are different this year  i am no trump supporter  and if he is the nominee  well i probably will pull the plug for him over a clinton or a sanders it is right back into the  who is worse  decision we have had the last several election cycles  i think this election is different this president has so thoroughly screwed up on the basics that the voter is keenly aware that you can not take those basics for granted his stimulus spending and the economy was an utter disaster  and we could have probably emerged from this recession sooner had we not gone down that path his attempt to nationalize the health care industry has been utter failure  generating 30hr work weeks his wide open border immigration policy has glutted the market with unskilled labor that drains the safety net and our public school system  and depresses wages for citizens who traditionally worked them his foreign policy apology tour  russian reset  picking the muslim brotherhood in egypt  drawing red lines then doing nothing  blaming terrorist action on a youtube video rather than the secretary s optics policiesall of this is screw up on all the basics  so when trump goes out there and thumps his chest on immigration  or he talks about building up the military  or running the economy like a business  and not once apologizing for the nation he loves  people see he has the basics right over and over he hammers on these basics all his focus is on that  and people understand it  so when a paul or a cruz gets up there and makes a nuanced consitutional point  they do nt really get it  and they come back to trump  and how he is going to be the payback for what this president screwed up  when a bush or a rubio or a kasich gives their usual wormy response about pathways to citizenship  the public most clearly knows that not a single one of them has the basics right they go back to trump who is there hammering home deportations and walls  so by pushing depth and breadth of issues and ignoring the basics  this field facing trump really do not get the mood of this public obama has so royally screwed up  that we can no longer count on basics these other candidates could stand to learn from trump and drive home the basics more they could stand to learn from reagan who was a master at educating the public on the basics of free market v socialism  until it is clear any candidate has the basics seared into their brains and knows what their marching orders are from their boss  the american people  trump will still draw off votes with the basics  and the public will ignore depth and breadth issues take that wind out of his sails and a harder look at depth and breadth is in order ,d029ugy,conservative,news,1455652717,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

it s been pretty obvious to me for a while that trump is a democrat and a liar i mean  up until he started running for the nomination  he was solidly democrat on everything why on earth do people believe what he s saying now that he s changed his tune  if hillary clinton was for something before she was running for the nomination  and then changed her mind once she started running  what would you believe is her true position  the one  before  she started running  duh why is trump any different  we have several good candidates to consider yet we re talking about trump  it s mindboggling so far as i can see he just offers people a chance to be angry  with all his big talk about doing this and doing that  heedless of the constitution or anything  he ll just accomplish everything by sheer force of will that s democrat talk  that s how the democrats operate and we should know better than that we oppose all these executive orders by obama not just because they re bad ideas but because that s not how presidents should behave  period obama has been trying to act like a king and the cure for that is nt to elect our own  king  ,d022zww,conservative,news,1455643459,cypherhalo,5,0,1,1570,0.0

as a berniebro  i m very suspicious of bernie s hope for being able to create a successful nordic model in america but even radically right wing libertarian economists like tyler cowen give deserved respect to what the nordic countries have managed   the world s best in human development and wellbeing indexes  the lowest poverty and employment rates in the world  better freetrade and easeofdoing business than america  ranked by conservative powerhouse think tank  heritage foundation   free healthcare and university tuition  incredibly high minimum wages  and so on   they ve done this while keeping their markets very competitive and highly innovative they also have the highest wealth inequalities in the advanced world while maintaining the low income inequality i m very doubtful something like this could be replicated in america  but i think giving respect where s it s due is important as a liberal i m always shocked at how beautifully switzerland manages for their lower classes without a big state but we should nt kid ourselves into believing america is some switzerland and we should nt convince ourselves into believing that scandinavia is hell  they just feel a lot more connected to their neighbors than americans do  and they freely and willfully vote in parties that campaign for the welfarestate americans are a lot less homogeneous and naturally  the inclination to give 50  of your salary to people you barely can develop empathy for just wo nt work  i always thought conservativism was about pragmatism and steering clear from ideological naiveties in the place of doing what works i think all those things i listed above are things conservatives value  and i think what conservatives value is the free choice to mold a society around their own ideals denmark has an approval rating of 8590  of their irs  in comparison to 58  in america we all know scandinavia is nt some military fascist regime where people are shuttled into workcamps like north korea  if the people want to live this way  and they can run a very very competitive society while doing it  why call them devils  or worse yet  fictional ,d02glps,conservative,news,1455661760,aged_monkey,1,0,3100,5913,0.0

as much as one would hope attacking trumps conservative bona fides would be effective  i think the rules are different this year  i am no trump supporter  and if he is the nominee  well i probably will pull the plug for him over a clinton or a sanders it is right back into the  who is worse  decision we have had the last several election cycles  i think this election is different this president has so thoroughly screwed up on the basics that the voter is keenly aware that you can not take those basics for granted his stimulus spending and the economy was an utter disaster  and we could have probably emerged from this recession sooner had we not gone down that path his attempt to nationalize the health care industry has been utter failure  generating 30hr work weeks his wide open border immigration policy has glutted the market with unskilled labor that drains the safety net and our public school system  and depresses wages for citizens who traditionally worked them his foreign policy apology tour  russian reset  picking the muslim brotherhood in egypt  drawing red lines then doing nothing  blaming terrorist action on a youtube video rather than the secretary s optics policiesall of this is screw up on all the basics  so when trump goes out there and thumps his chest on immigration  or he talks about building up the military  or running the economy like a business  and not once apologizing for the nation he loves  people see he has the basics right over and over he hammers on these basics all his focus is on that  and people understand it  so when a paul or a cruz gets up there and makes a nuanced consitutional point  they do nt really get it  and they come back to trump  and how he is going to be the payback for what this president screwed up  when a bush or a rubio or a kasich gives their usual wormy response about pathways to citizenship  the public most clearly knows that not a single one of them has the basics right they go back to trump who is there hammering home deportations and walls  so by pushing depth and breadth of issues and ignoring the basics  this field facing trump really do not get the mood of this public obama has so royally screwed up  that we can no longer count on basics these other candidates could stand to learn from trump and drive home the basics more they could stand to learn from reagan who was a master at educating the public on the basics of free market v socialism  until it is clear any candidate has the basics seared into their brains and knows what their marching orders are from their boss  the american people  trump will still draw off votes with the basics  and the public will ignore depth and breadth issues take that wind out of his sails and a harder look at depth and breadth is in order ,d029ugy,conservative,news,1455652717,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

the democrats have been the party of racists since their very beginning they seceded from the union before lincoln  the socalled father of the republican party  could abolish slavery  they founded the kkk  and they greatly stunted minority economic progress with the advent of the welfare state the fact is blacks experienced their greatest period of progress by proving to every white man that they did nt just deserve to be looked upon as equals they earned it they did this in the face of all the legal and even statemandated racism that occurred at the time the welfare state marked the end of decreasing black poverty  a sad fact that still haunts our society today  i strongly believe that these socalled liberals are supremely racist they believe that we need lower standards for blacks to gain admittance to the same schools we believe intelligence and standards should nt be judged by race  and no matter what race you are  your achievements are tied to your merits they are elitists who believe that poor americans  many of whom are black  need their help in order to succeed  rather than getting out of their way and allowing them to work moreover  these collectivists believe in class and identity warfare  rather than diversity of individual opinion they believe blacks who do not share the same opinion on slavery reparations or affirmative action are nt real blacks  much the same way they believe women who are prolife are nt real women they believe ben carson  thomas sowell  and clarence thomas are nt real blacks they believe sarah palin  carly fiorina  and michele bachmann are nt real women they believe ted cruz and marco rubio are nt real hispanics  looking at you  new york times   the democratic party has always been  and will always be  the party of racists the only thing that changed in their philosophy is they convinced themselves that the racist acts they commit  racist beliefs they hold  and racist policies they support are actually beneficial for society as a whole ,d01vjbb,conservative,news,1455631442,TreadNotOnMe,164,0,162,406,1.0

i have nt read the article  but liberals seem to feel entitled to everything  including the unquestioning support of the demographics to which they pander the fact that they have put so much effort and money and time into pandering to black people and  yet  some black people still do nt buy their rhetoric is infuriating to them so  they lash out and call him names like  uncle tom  the nature of the epithet  uncle tom  is a perfect example of what i m saying basically  it s based on the premise that black people have an obligation to one another by virtue of their race  and that the person being accused is violating that obligation what liberals do nt want black voters  or anyone else  for that matter  to realize is that they have no obligation to their race  religion  gender  sexual orientation  or other demographic markers they have obligation to their family  perhaps to their loved ones  certainly but otherwise  the only thing they owe other people is to treat them in the way that they would prefer to be treated  within reason  clarence thomas rejects the premise of that obligation  and opposes the liberal line that made him the enemy  and prompted many liberals to show their true colors  no pun intended ,d01zh79,conservative,news,1455638400,DukeMaximum,8,0,44327,76576,0.0

the point being made here is that cruz is running an effective  traditional  and strategic campaign comparatively  trump is not putting nearly as much effort on the ground game  i ve no doubt that funding inhibits trump to an extent yet  what does this say about his ability to wage a campaign in the general election  this makes me wonder what trump s motivations are when you listen to cruz he passionately lists out both the us s domestic and foreign problems and gives detailed solutions on the other hand  trump mostly points outwardly he blames the chinese or mexico for or problems he makes generalizations on how it will  make america great   if trump were elected i question how much he d really care to work hard to make many of his general promises a reality i really wonder if he s just running for president simply because he can ,d021mrt,conservative,news,1455641534,PluviusReddit,7,0,62,6598,0.0
good piece  beck was saying cruz had a huge ground game in iowa  but that was nothing compared to sc  where they have a much larger ground game will the evangelicals turn out and decide this  nobody talks about cruz in the media he is nt a ratings boost like trump lefties hate him and so desperately want to run against trump  so they hold all the crap on trump and just lay into cruz where possible fox and establishment sources want jeb  or rubio or kasich  and they continually push for those guys over cruz  even when cruz whallops them  but from what i can tell conservative talk radio is backing cruz big  and so too are the conservative online sources which is more influential with republican primary voters  we shall see  rush goes on about how trump has written off evangelicals and is pandering to the left in this open primary state ok  fair point my point though is he has a bloody dogfight ahead of him in this regard with kasich  who thinks a conservative past plus modern ladles full of melted lefty cheese will make him appeal more broadly kasich did everthing but bend over to the lefty leaning independents in nh to court that side of the fence  and he is branding himself as a centrist now hell  he even said recently he is the happy warm middle between hillary and bernie i suppose trump could pander harder by pointing to his solid past of supporting lefty causes  but he will have to do better than just lip service in debates to suck up to the lefties harder than kasich ,d02buk1,conservative,news,1455655352,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,d02dwhd,conservative,news,1455658094,wiseprogressivethink,1,0,137571,11206,0.0

for those of you who do nt believe in voter fraud or think it is nt a big deal  you are wrong  here are some facts  a dramatic example of fraud was revealed by a new york state grand jury the grand jury detailed a widespread conspiracy that operated without detection for 14 years in brooklyn this conspiracy involved not only impersonation of legitimate voters at the polls  but also voting under fictitious names as a result  thousands of fraudulent votes were cast in state and congressional elections  one of the witnesses before the grand jury described how he led a crew of eight individuals from polling place to polling place to vote each member of his crew voted in excess of 20 times  and there were approximately 20 other such crews operating during that election  a study by the university of missouri on turnout in indiana showed that turnout actually increased by about 2 percentage points overall in indiana in 2006 in the first election after the voter id law went into effect  a study by the university of delaware and the university of nebraska  lincoln examined data from the 2000  2002  2004  and 2006 elections at both the aggregate and individual levels  the study found that voter id laws do not affect turnout  including across racialethnicsocioeconomic lines the study concludes that  concerns about voter identification laws affecting turnout are much ado about nothing  the colorado secretary of state recently testified before congress that a check of the voter registration rolls indicated over 11000 individuals who were noncitizens at the time they registered to vote  at least 5000 of whom likely voted  a georgia voter id requirement went into effect when it was upheld in final orders issued by every state and federal court in georgia that reviewed the law  including the eleventh circuit court of appeals and  most recently  the georgia supreme court as these courts held  such an id requirement is not discriminatory and does not violate the constitution or any federal voting rights laws  including the voting rights act of 1965 in georgia  as has happened in every state that has considered voter id legislation  organizations like the aclu and the naacp made specious claims that there were hundreds of thousands of voters without photo id yet when dismissing all of their claims  the federal court pointed out that after two years of litigation  none of the plaintiff organizations like the naacp had been able to produce a single individual or member who did not have a photo id or could not easily obtain one  america is one of the only democracies in the world that does not uniformly require voters to present photo id when they vote across the globe  democracies administer such a requirement without any problems and without any reports that their citizens are in any way burdened when voting  in fact  america  s southern neighbor mexico  which has a much larger rate of poverty than the united states  requires both a photo id and a thumbprint to vote  and turnout has increased in mexican elections since this requirement went into effect in the 1990s mexico  s voter id laws are also credited with reducing the fraud that had prevailed in many mexican elections and  allowing the 2000 election of vicente fox  the first opposition party candidate to be elected president of mexico in seventy years  this can do nothing but help keep people honest any fraud is theft of rights from someone else the electoral system can not inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters as the us supreme court has noted  voter id protects the integrity and reliability of the electoral process  if anything  the evidence has shown that voter id laws actually increased democratic voter turnout  voter id can prevent and deter  impersonation fraud at the polls  voting under fictitious voter registrations  double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality  and voting by illegal aliens  or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since state and federal elections are restricted to us citizens  from your boy bernie   voter fraud is  in fact  a serious crime in my view it should be punished   bernie sanders looks like he and i do nt disagree on everything ,d01se06,conservative,news,1455622520,Indominus_Rex,6,0,61,157,0.0

the democrats have been the party of racists since their very beginning they seceded from the union before lincoln  the socalled father of the republican party  could abolish slavery  they founded the kkk  and they greatly stunted minority economic progress with the advent of the welfare state the fact is blacks experienced their greatest period of progress by proving to every white man that they did nt just deserve to be looked upon as equals they earned it they did this in the face of all the legal and even statemandated racism that occurred at the time the welfare state marked the end of decreasing black poverty  a sad fact that still haunts our society today  i strongly believe that these socalled liberals are supremely racist they believe that we need lower standards for blacks to gain admittance to the same schools we believe intelligence and standards should nt be judged by race  and no matter what race you are  your achievements are tied to your merits they are elitists who believe that poor americans  many of whom are black  need their help in order to succeed  rather than getting out of their way and allowing them to work moreover  these collectivists believe in class and identity warfare  rather than diversity of individual opinion they believe blacks who do not share the same opinion on slavery reparations or affirmative action are nt real blacks  much the same way they believe women who are prolife are nt real women they believe ben carson  thomas sowell  and clarence thomas are nt real blacks they believe sarah palin  carly fiorina  and michele bachmann are nt real women they believe ted cruz and marco rubio are nt real hispanics  looking at you  new york times   the democratic party has always been  and will always be  the party of racists the only thing that changed in their philosophy is they convinced themselves that the racist acts they commit  racist beliefs they hold  and racist policies they support are actually beneficial for society as a whole ,d01vjbb,conservative,news,1455631442,TreadNotOnMe,164,0,162,406,1.0

for those of you who do nt believe in voter fraud or think it is nt a big deal  you are wrong  here are some facts  a dramatic example of fraud was revealed by a new york state grand jury the grand jury detailed a widespread conspiracy that operated without detection for 14 years in brooklyn this conspiracy involved not only impersonation of legitimate voters at the polls  but also voting under fictitious names as a result  thousands of fraudulent votes were cast in state and congressional elections  one of the witnesses before the grand jury described how he led a crew of eight individuals from polling place to polling place to vote each member of his crew voted in excess of 20 times  and there were approximately 20 other such crews operating during that election  a study by the university of missouri on turnout in indiana showed that turnout actually increased by about 2 percentage points overall in indiana in 2006 in the first election after the voter id law went into effect  a study by the university of delaware and the university of nebraska  lincoln examined data from the 2000  2002  2004  and 2006 elections at both the aggregate and individual levels  the study found that voter id laws do not affect turnout  including across racialethnicsocioeconomic lines the study concludes that  concerns about voter identification laws affecting turnout are much ado about nothing  the colorado secretary of state recently testified before congress that a check of the voter registration rolls indicated over 11000 individuals who were noncitizens at the time they registered to vote  at least 5000 of whom likely voted  a georgia voter id requirement went into effect when it was upheld in final orders issued by every state and federal court in georgia that reviewed the law  including the eleventh circuit court of appeals and  most recently  the georgia supreme court as these courts held  such an id requirement is not discriminatory and does not violate the constitution or any federal voting rights laws  including the voting rights act of 1965 in georgia  as has happened in every state that has considered voter id legislation  organizations like the aclu and the naacp made specious claims that there were hundreds of thousands of voters without photo id yet when dismissing all of their claims  the federal court pointed out that after two years of litigation  none of the plaintiff organizations like the naacp had been able to produce a single individual or member who did not have a photo id or could not easily obtain one  america is one of the only democracies in the world that does not uniformly require voters to present photo id when they vote across the globe  democracies administer such a requirement without any problems and without any reports that their citizens are in any way burdened when voting  in fact  america  s southern neighbor mexico  which has a much larger rate of poverty than the united states  requires both a photo id and a thumbprint to vote  and turnout has increased in mexican elections since this requirement went into effect in the 1990s mexico  s voter id laws are also credited with reducing the fraud that had prevailed in many mexican elections and  allowing the 2000 election of vicente fox  the first opposition party candidate to be elected president of mexico in seventy years  this can do nothing but help keep people honest any fraud is theft of rights from someone else the electoral system can not inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters as the us supreme court has noted  voter id protects the integrity and reliability of the electoral process  if anything  the evidence has shown that voter id laws actually increased democratic voter turnout  voter id can prevent and deter  impersonation fraud at the polls  voting under fictitious voter registrations  double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality  and voting by illegal aliens  or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since state and federal elections are restricted to us citizens  from your boy bernie   voter fraud is  in fact  a serious crime in my view it should be punished   bernie sanders looks like he and i do nt disagree on everything ,d01se06,conservative,news,1455622520,Indominus_Rex,6,0,61,157,0.0

as a berniebro  i m very suspicious of bernie s hope for being able to create a successful nordic model in america but even radically right wing libertarian economists like tyler cowen give deserved respect to what the nordic countries have managed   the world s best in human development and wellbeing indexes  the lowest poverty and employment rates in the world  better freetrade and easeofdoing business than america  ranked by conservative powerhouse think tank  heritage foundation   free healthcare and university tuition  incredibly high minimum wages  and so on   they ve done this while keeping their markets very competitive and highly innovative they also have the highest wealth inequalities in the advanced world while maintaining the low income inequality i m very doubtful something like this could be replicated in america  but i think giving respect where s it s due is important as a liberal i m always shocked at how beautifully switzerland manages for their lower classes without a big state but we should nt kid ourselves into believing america is some switzerland and we should nt convince ourselves into believing that scandinavia is hell  they just feel a lot more connected to their neighbors than americans do  and they freely and willfully vote in parties that campaign for the welfarestate americans are a lot less homogeneous and naturally  the inclination to give 50  of your salary to people you barely can develop empathy for just wo nt work  i always thought conservativism was about pragmatism and steering clear from ideological naiveties in the place of doing what works i think all those things i listed above are things conservatives value  and i think what conservatives value is the free choice to mold a society around their own ideals denmark has an approval rating of 8590  of their irs  in comparison to 58  in america we all know scandinavia is nt some military fascist regime where people are shuttled into workcamps like north korea  if the people want to live this way  and they can run a very very competitive society while doing it  why call them devils  or worse yet  fictional ,d02glps,conservative,news,1455661760,aged_monkey,1,0,3100,5913,0.0

if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,d02dwhd,conservative,news,1455658094,wiseprogressivethink,1,0,137571,11206,0.0

the point being made here is that cruz is running an effective  traditional  and strategic campaign comparatively  trump is not putting nearly as much effort on the ground game  i ve no doubt that funding inhibits trump to an extent yet  what does this say about his ability to wage a campaign in the general election  this makes me wonder what trump s motivations are when you listen to cruz he passionately lists out both the us s domestic and foreign problems and gives detailed solutions on the other hand  trump mostly points outwardly he blames the chinese or mexico for or problems he makes generalizations on how it will  make america great   if trump were elected i question how much he d really care to work hard to make many of his general promises a reality i really wonder if he s just running for president simply because he can ,d021mrt,conservative,news,1455641534,PluviusReddit,7,0,62,6598,0.0
good piece  beck was saying cruz had a huge ground game in iowa  but that was nothing compared to sc  where they have a much larger ground game will the evangelicals turn out and decide this  nobody talks about cruz in the media he is nt a ratings boost like trump lefties hate him and so desperately want to run against trump  so they hold all the crap on trump and just lay into cruz where possible fox and establishment sources want jeb  or rubio or kasich  and they continually push for those guys over cruz  even when cruz whallops them  but from what i can tell conservative talk radio is backing cruz big  and so too are the conservative online sources which is more influential with republican primary voters  we shall see  rush goes on about how trump has written off evangelicals and is pandering to the left in this open primary state ok  fair point my point though is he has a bloody dogfight ahead of him in this regard with kasich  who thinks a conservative past plus modern ladles full of melted lefty cheese will make him appeal more broadly kasich did everthing but bend over to the lefty leaning independents in nh to court that side of the fence  and he is branding himself as a centrist now hell  he even said recently he is the happy warm middle between hillary and bernie i suppose trump could pander harder by pointing to his solid past of supporting lefty causes  but he will have to do better than just lip service in debates to suck up to the lefties harder than kasich ,d02buk1,conservative,news,1455655352,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

the democrats have been the party of racists since their very beginning they seceded from the union before lincoln  the socalled father of the republican party  could abolish slavery  they founded the kkk  and they greatly stunted minority economic progress with the advent of the welfare state the fact is blacks experienced their greatest period of progress by proving to every white man that they did nt just deserve to be looked upon as equals they earned it they did this in the face of all the legal and even statemandated racism that occurred at the time the welfare state marked the end of decreasing black poverty  a sad fact that still haunts our society today  i strongly believe that these socalled liberals are supremely racist they believe that we need lower standards for blacks to gain admittance to the same schools we believe intelligence and standards should nt be judged by race  and no matter what race you are  your achievements are tied to your merits they are elitists who believe that poor americans  many of whom are black  need their help in order to succeed  rather than getting out of their way and allowing them to work moreover  these collectivists believe in class and identity warfare  rather than diversity of individual opinion they believe blacks who do not share the same opinion on slavery reparations or affirmative action are nt real blacks  much the same way they believe women who are prolife are nt real women they believe ben carson  thomas sowell  and clarence thomas are nt real blacks they believe sarah palin  carly fiorina  and michele bachmann are nt real women they believe ted cruz and marco rubio are nt real hispanics  looking at you  new york times   the democratic party has always been  and will always be  the party of racists the only thing that changed in their philosophy is they convinced themselves that the racist acts they commit  racist beliefs they hold  and racist policies they support are actually beneficial for society as a whole ,d01vjbb,conservative,news,1455631442,TreadNotOnMe,164,0,162,406,1.0

because the democrats have a long standing history of racism dating back to the kkk being part of their party  fighting to keep slavery  creating gun bansregistrations to keep newly freed slaves from owning guns  going against the civil rights act until they realized that they can get their votes by keeping them reliant upon government for all their needs it s the main reason the republican party came into being and why so many early black leaders were republican  today minorities are still seen as slaves by the dnc  and the establishment as a whole  but as  economic slaves   if you keep them on welfare and unemployment  you keep them controlled and they will keep voting to get free shit it s a technique used throughout history very effectively by dictators  socialistscommunists etc  it s also why you find the supported influx of illegals now too even when it s costing jobs to american citizens it s a whole new class of  economic slaves  that can be extorted and abused if you can get a majority of the population reliant on  big brother  government  you ve assured yourself a guaranteed voting base that will not only keep you in power  but support you even when you take away individual freedoms and rights from everyone else ,d025uz0,conservative,news,1455647363,Sumner67,7,0,252,11067,0.0
