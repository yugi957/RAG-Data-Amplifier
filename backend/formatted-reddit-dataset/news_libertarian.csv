we have laws that state how to become a citizen some people follow these laws and some people do not the people that do not follow the laws are here illegally right  i assume therefore part of law enforcement is to send these people back to their country  all i want is to have laws that will be enforced and everyone will agree that these are the laws these laws most 100  be enforced if we do not plan on ever really enforcing them then lets not have these laws  it seems clear now we have a lot of people who are here and we are not going to make them go home if this is the reality then lets act rationally and bring them in the system and collect taxes on them so they can pay their part  i feel like we are in limbo with one side that keeps saying we are finally going to send them all back and the other side making excuses not to send them back  i just want the logically solution that gives the most economic benefit  why ca nt we just agree on laws that we can enforce and enforce them and move on to something else ,4631aa,libertarian,news,1455638108.0,punkouter,4.0,0.0,230,2863,0.0

it s true that there are certain market inefficiencies that exist one example is skewed distribution of wealth that results in some people not being able to afford important goods or services like healthcare  the question must be asked though  is the market inefficiency worse than the government inefficiency  to use the threat of violence to confiscate resources from each other to reallocate towards the priorities of the majority  in this case govt healthcare   comes with great costs as well  the answer to this question can only come from study of history to see which markets and societies have enjoyed the greatest levels of prosperity  i believe that most people in this sub have observed that the greatest levels of prosperity  including the highest quality and quantity of medical care provided  have been in the countries with the greatest respect for individual liberty  many countries have failed to provide even moderate levels of care because they trusted the collective to allocate society s resources rather than the individual for example  during the cuban revolution  high quality universal healthcare was among the highest priorities of the government large amounts of resources were committed to healthcare and in some ways  the population benefited in the short term however  the sacrifices that came with the loss of individual liberty and respect for private property were great the productivity of the country fell and ultimately the level of care  and general quality of life  was not as great as it might have been  tl  dr   in practice  respect for individual liberty leads to better healthcare outcomes than socialism  ,d02o9i6,libertarian,news,1455673487.0,fortisle,2.0,0.0,441,1976,0.0

hi  i m a college student at one of the most obnoxiously liberal colleges in the us and am taking a political science course on disability rights in the us while i consider myself a libertarian i have nt thought much about this issue before and was wondering where some of you might stand more specifically  if there a point where someone is so disabled  the example i had in mind was extreme some extreme neuromuscular disorder  that they can not provide the means to care for themselves  could the burden of their existence fall on anybody else  my libertarian side wants to say no  but it seems unusually cruel to say that they should just be left to die if it could fall to somebody  would it be their family or ought it to fall on society evenly  or should they be left solely to charity  the inspiration for my questions comes from reading some of the articles written by harriet mcbryde johnson whose survival through her younger years was due largely to her family s wealth and ability to afford proper care for her  others probably would not have survived or lived as meaningful of a life had their parents not been as wealthy   the background info i got from my professor  i have nt verified how wealthy her parents were while she was growing up so i ca nt vouch 100  on how influential her wealth was to her survival  but if it means anything this professor is one of the few that i trust to keep politics and facts separate   the articles i read can be found here  http  wwwnytimescom20030216magazineunspeakableconversationshtml  pagewanted  all http  wwwnytimescom20031123magazinethedisabilitygulaghtml  pagewanted  all thank you in advance to anybody who takes the time to offer a thoughtful reply to my question ,466ji5,libertarian,news,1455683211.0,pm_me_ur_liberty,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

sweet  score one for equality  now politicians and professors will stop jabbering about it  right  right  if only the pay gap rhetoric was never really about economic equality  it has always been about identity politics that s not to say that some of the conversations we ve had along the way have nt been important there have been a lot of assumptions and impositions of gender roles  founded in an undeniable cultural history of sexism and injustice to both sexes  which  feminist  movements have addressed  but those are just the few sane planks in an otherwise demagogic  divisive platform it s hard to say what their actual endgame may beor if there even  is  onesince it s not like the movement has a cohesive leadership maybe it s ending the  patriarchy   whatever that means anymore most likely  it s just like every other identity politics movement  and all about getting more for themselves  and less for others  even if people actually start openly acknowledging that the gender pay gap myth is busted  the rhetoric will still continue in the name of  compensating for historical oppression   in order to offset the trends of the past things like girls growing up with certain role models and cultural expectations that  might  steer them toward certain career paths or away from others  as a relic of a bygone era hey  whatever maybe this is a real problem  and this is an effective way to fix it it does nt make it any less bullshit  but whatever they ll do what they want my school has entire wings dedicated specifically to women in business and in science  and the registrar s office has at least a 3 to one ratio of womenonly to coed scholarship pool nobody says anything about that  because everyone s trying so hard to appear politically correct and  maybe  it s even necessary in any case  the benefactors of most of the scholarships should be free to determine who should and should nt be eligible to receive their support  but we all know what would happen if the reverse were the case  the point of this rant  and the reason why i think this does belong in rlibertarian  is because far too much of politics is driven by this sort of thing people vote for a candidate because he or she speaks out for or against something personal to them  not because they re trying to improve the lot of  all  people  let alone trying to protect our rights and freedoms we so often hear about the right being the side who s always trying to impose its values on society  but this is a prime example of the left s happiness to do the same thing neither is justifiable  and yet one side catches all of the crap for it to be fair  the right does seem to make  values  a more prominent part of its platform  either way  it s all the same window dressing  the same pointless bickering  pitting us against each other so we do nt notice that not a damn one of the people in charge is actually interested in anything but power to help themselves they get fat off of our labor  they gain power from our votes  and only occasionally throw us a bone to fight over  just so we do nt turn and realize how much better off we d be if we just tore them apart ,d02d1vd,libertarian,news,1455656960.0,prince_harming,1.0,0.0,281,21782,0.0

what s interesting about this debate is that rand paul is actually espousing the exact same view barack obama took while he was still in the senate  specifically  that the  idealogical  positions of any appointee are valid criteria for rejecting that appointee  gt  i disagree with this view i believe firmly that the constitution calls for the senate to advise and consent i believe that it calls for meaningful advice and consent that includes an examination of a judge  s philosophy  ideology  and record and when i examine the philosophy  ideology  and record of samuel alito  i  m deeply troubled  if democrats want to make judicial litmus tests over who will reverse the citizens united decision  then it seems fair for republicans like rand paul to do the same over issues like eminent domain abuse ,d01sblv,libertarian,news,1455622263.0,7Redacted,0.0,0.0,66294,21455,0.0

for those who are nt familiar with the world of guns   a collection of 17 guns is not at all out of the ordinary for hobbyist gun collectors and recreational shooters 14 of these guns were handguns  meaning this entire collection would easily fit in a regular 12x18x54  locker or similarly sized gun safe   45000 rounds of ammunition seems like a lot  but a 1000round brick  of 22lr ammo  the most common round used in recreational shooting  is about the size of a thick paperback novel owning several dozen bricks of 22lr ammo is again not at all out of the ordinary  especially since a large number of gunowners have overbought on it since the postsandyhook panic which made ammunition in this and other common calibers become extremely scarce and expensive for several years to follow   225lb of gunpower is about 28 commercially sold tubs worth of the stuff this is a lot  and certainly more than someone should store in an apartment  but not surprising bearing in mind that reloading for different calibers  or even different applications within the same caliber  all require different types of gunpowder which would each be purchased in 8lb tubs gunpowder and other reloading supplies also became very scarce after the sandy hook panic and were subsequently overbought by people who do homereloading  for fear of it becoming unavailable and its possible that it was part of a bulkbuy to be shared with other people  or otherwise only being kept in the apartment temporarily ,d0128jh,libertarian,news,1455569463.0,baggytheo,40.0,0.0,3559,10581,0.0

gt   welcome to the world of the ron paul supporters in 2012 and 2008  you can not win  sincerely   every ron paul supporter who you ignored for 8 years  i m sorry  but ron paul was ignored  because he was never a nationally viable candidate his policies were libertarianish   i suppose  but voters rejected his religious extremism you could see it bleed through into every aspect of his politics as an evangelical christian  paul attempted numerous times to ban sodomy  make abortion illegal  support federal bans on samesex marriage through dadt and doma  ban gay adoption  ban contraception and block federal funding of family planning  in addition to repeated attempts to bin secularism so that he could violate the separation of church and state he was just as much a religious lunatic as huckabee or santorum  which made him just as unelectable  when you add to that his other radical agendas of opposing net neutrality  81  disagree   cutting social security  70  disagree   eliminating medicare for the elderlydisabled  77  disagree  and medicaid for the poor  63  disagree   denial of global warming  71  disagree  privatising all federal lands  opposing all government funding of medical research  allowing hospital emergency rooms to turn people away  eliminating the fda  i could go on according to polls  these positions are  deeply  unpopular with the american people in 2008  ron paul got 7  in iowa and 10  in new hampshire  before being obliterated nationally on super tuesday  5    the establishment did nt need to take him out  because people just did nt like his policy positions he was democratically discarded  bernie sanders  however  drew iowa with 50  of the vote and won new hampshire with 604   he strongly supports net neutrality  social security  medicare  medicaid  accepts the science on global warming  he s a genuinely popular candidate with  national  appeal  gt   the dnc chooses the nominee  not you  this is false whilst superdelegates could  theoretically  be used by the dnc to flip the popular vote and select the least popular candidate  superdelegates have historically always chosen the candidate with the most votes currently  this is bernie sanders no superdelegate is committed to a candidate and clinton s current count is just as meaningless as it was in 2008 they are free to flipflop all through the election process if bernie sanders wins the popular vote on the ground  he  will  be the dnc nominee ,d00jcl1,libertarian,news,1455534277.0,ArguingFromIgnorance,2.0,0.0,880,222,0.0

i do nt like the problem that a corporation could rich off a private prison  that is not really an argument will private prisons break the law or cheat prisoners  that is the issue  but why would a private prison be more corrupt than a public prison  america is a large country with 300 million people and has a large prison system  for whatever that is worth   at times the state ca nt police  enforce the law and establish a prison and do it effectively all at the same time there is corruption in the prison system as well with state employees running that system the argument for private prisons is that private prisons can run a system better than a public system can the state can monitor and set rules on how the prison and run and what guidelines to meet there are many examples of privatepublic partnerships private companies like mwh  halibruton and others and engineering firms work on construction projects all over the us that are paid for by the state and tax payers those are contracts or even charter schools are schools run by independent groups that receive funding from the state private security firms  mercenaries are used by the us state department for security    ultimately  it comes down to  who can do the job better  and i do nt think there is an argument for them  i do nt see how it is illegal for private industry to bid for contracts in housing prisoners if the private companies can support the prisons  more power to them  http  countercurrentnewscom201602fbiarrests46georgiadeputiesforsellingtoprisoners,d014zxe,libertarian,news,1455573482.0,berlinbrown,1.0,0.0,4911,27284,0.0

hi  i m a college student at one of the most obnoxiously liberal colleges in the us and am taking a political science course on disability rights in the us while i consider myself a libertarian i have nt thought much about this issue before and was wondering where some of you might stand more specifically  if there a point where someone is so disabled  the example i had in mind was extreme some extreme neuromuscular disorder  that they can not provide the means to care for themselves  could the burden of their existence fall on anybody else  my libertarian side wants to say no  but it seems unusually cruel to say that they should just be left to die if it could fall to somebody  would it be their family or ought it to fall on society evenly  or should they be left solely to charity  the inspiration for my questions comes from reading some of the articles written by harriet mcbryde johnson whose survival through her younger years was due largely to her family s wealth and ability to afford proper care for her  others probably would not have survived or lived as meaningful of a life had their parents not been as wealthy   the background info i got from my professor  i have nt verified how wealthy her parents were while she was growing up so i ca nt vouch 100  on how influential her wealth was to her survival  but if it means anything this professor is one of the few that i trust to keep politics and facts separate   the articles i read can be found here  http  wwwnytimescom20030216magazineunspeakableconversationshtml  pagewanted  all http  wwwnytimescom20031123magazinethedisabilitygulaghtml  pagewanted  all thank you in advance to anybody who takes the time to offer a thoughtful reply to my question ,466ji5,libertarian,news,1455683211.0,pm_me_ur_liberty,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

i approach most social and cultural issues as a libertarian but am on the fence in terms of my position on healthcare i m not attached to any system in particular  but i m in favour of any system which ensures the best health coverage for the largest amount of people i m just not sure of how that can be best carried out in practical terms  being from canada  where we have singlepayer national health care  i can see both the advantages and disadvantages of this system although waiting times can be long  and doctors  lower pay means there is a shortage of practitioners  i see the fact that anyone can access essential or emergency health care services without going massively into debt as a major positive in the united states  on the other hand  it seems that doctors are better paid and of higher quality  but i hear stories of people not being able to afford lifesaving treatments i know the us is not a perfect example of a true free market  but health care there seems to be far more privatized than it is here  is there any evidence that a true free market health care system is better for everyone  we can talk principles all we want but if a system does not work in practice  then i do nt see its merit what are your thoughts ,464aw5,libertarian,news,1455653166.0,waflhat,10.0,0.0,559,328,0.0
healthcare is also one issue where i diverge from most of the people in this sub  a true free market healthcare system is not possible to implement  at least in regards to emergency medicine a free market requires that the consumers have  at the very minimum  the  ability  to research their options and make rational decisions  even if they may not always do so in emergency medicine this is often not possible you might want to go to a certain hospital because of their pricescarewhatever  you might even have a contract with theman insurance provider that allows you to do so without serious burden but if you are going to bleed out before you make it there you  need  to go to the closest hospital  not the one your insurance covers if you have a heart attack or are in an accident you may not even be conscious to tell people what hospital or what ambulance company you want to use  for nonemergency medicine  yes a free market system could work and it may or may not be better than other systems but free markets require that the consumer have the ability to make rational decisions  and in emergency medicine that is often not the case for that reason the free market and emergency medicine are fundamentally incompatible ,d02jdeu,libertarian,news,1455665894.0,Qel_Hoth,7.0,0.0,71,15450,0.0

it s true that there are certain market inefficiencies that exist one example is skewed distribution of wealth that results in some people not being able to afford important goods or services like healthcare  the question must be asked though  is the market inefficiency worse than the government inefficiency  to use the threat of violence to confiscate resources from each other to reallocate towards the priorities of the majority  in this case govt healthcare   comes with great costs as well  the answer to this question can only come from study of history to see which markets and societies have enjoyed the greatest levels of prosperity  i believe that most people in this sub have observed that the greatest levels of prosperity  including the highest quality and quantity of medical care provided  have been in the countries with the greatest respect for individual liberty  many countries have failed to provide even moderate levels of care because they trusted the collective to allocate society s resources rather than the individual for example  during the cuban revolution  high quality universal healthcare was among the highest priorities of the government large amounts of resources were committed to healthcare and in some ways  the population benefited in the short term however  the sacrifices that came with the loss of individual liberty and respect for private property were great the productivity of the country fell and ultimately the level of care  and general quality of life  was not as great as it might have been  tl  dr   in practice  respect for individual liberty leads to better healthcare outcomes than socialism  ,d02o9i6,libertarian,news,1455673487.0,fortisle,2.0,0.0,441,1976,0.0

sweet  score one for equality  now politicians and professors will stop jabbering about it  right  right  if only the pay gap rhetoric was never really about economic equality  it has always been about identity politics that s not to say that some of the conversations we ve had along the way have nt been important there have been a lot of assumptions and impositions of gender roles  founded in an undeniable cultural history of sexism and injustice to both sexes  which  feminist  movements have addressed  but those are just the few sane planks in an otherwise demagogic  divisive platform it s hard to say what their actual endgame may beor if there even  is  onesince it s not like the movement has a cohesive leadership maybe it s ending the  patriarchy   whatever that means anymore most likely  it s just like every other identity politics movement  and all about getting more for themselves  and less for others  even if people actually start openly acknowledging that the gender pay gap myth is busted  the rhetoric will still continue in the name of  compensating for historical oppression   in order to offset the trends of the past things like girls growing up with certain role models and cultural expectations that  might  steer them toward certain career paths or away from others  as a relic of a bygone era hey  whatever maybe this is a real problem  and this is an effective way to fix it it does nt make it any less bullshit  but whatever they ll do what they want my school has entire wings dedicated specifically to women in business and in science  and the registrar s office has at least a 3 to one ratio of womenonly to coed scholarship pool nobody says anything about that  because everyone s trying so hard to appear politically correct and  maybe  it s even necessary in any case  the benefactors of most of the scholarships should be free to determine who should and should nt be eligible to receive their support  but we all know what would happen if the reverse were the case  the point of this rant  and the reason why i think this does belong in rlibertarian  is because far too much of politics is driven by this sort of thing people vote for a candidate because he or she speaks out for or against something personal to them  not because they re trying to improve the lot of  all  people  let alone trying to protect our rights and freedoms we so often hear about the right being the side who s always trying to impose its values on society  but this is a prime example of the left s happiness to do the same thing neither is justifiable  and yet one side catches all of the crap for it to be fair  the right does seem to make  values  a more prominent part of its platform  either way  it s all the same window dressing  the same pointless bickering  pitting us against each other so we do nt notice that not a damn one of the people in charge is actually interested in anything but power to help themselves they get fat off of our labor  they gain power from our votes  and only occasionally throw us a bone to fight over  just so we do nt turn and realize how much better off we d be if we just tore them apart ,d02d1vd,libertarian,news,1455656960.0,prince_harming,1.0,0.0,281,21782,0.0

for those who are nt familiar with the world of guns   a collection of 17 guns is not at all out of the ordinary for hobbyist gun collectors and recreational shooters 14 of these guns were handguns  meaning this entire collection would easily fit in a regular 12x18x54  locker or similarly sized gun safe   45000 rounds of ammunition seems like a lot  but a 1000round brick  of 22lr ammo  the most common round used in recreational shooting  is about the size of a thick paperback novel owning several dozen bricks of 22lr ammo is again not at all out of the ordinary  especially since a large number of gunowners have overbought on it since the postsandyhook panic which made ammunition in this and other common calibers become extremely scarce and expensive for several years to follow   225lb of gunpower is about 28 commercially sold tubs worth of the stuff this is a lot  and certainly more than someone should store in an apartment  but not surprising bearing in mind that reloading for different calibers  or even different applications within the same caliber  all require different types of gunpowder which would each be purchased in 8lb tubs gunpowder and other reloading supplies also became very scarce after the sandy hook panic and were subsequently overbought by people who do homereloading  for fear of it becoming unavailable and its possible that it was part of a bulkbuy to be shared with other people  or otherwise only being kept in the apartment temporarily ,d0128jh,libertarian,news,1455569463.0,baggytheo,40.0,0.0,3559,10581,0.0

i m a little unclear but i m assuming you mean private prisons in a libertarian minarchist society  there are going to be elements of crony capitalism no matter what in such a paradigm since the government is presumable using tax money to house prisoners  assuming that  a key is competition in placement let s say it costs  60000 to house a prisoner in a maximum security facility the government would basically  give  that prisoner 60k to spend at any facility and would encourage prisons to  compete  for prisoners  there still would be elements of cronyism  probably through licensing of prisons  but there should be more options and competition then only the state providing the prisons  another argument that is brought up as a concern is that the private prisons are  incentivized to increases the amount of criminals   https  enwikipediaorgwikikids_for_cash_scandal   it s a problem but a problem i find to be even more pervasive with the state just look at the dea  atf or really the entire justice system ,d0178be,libertarian,news,1455576871.0,zoink,1.0,0.0,6858,19413,0.0
