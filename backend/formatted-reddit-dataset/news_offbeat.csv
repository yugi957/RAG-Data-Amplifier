while i think  fecal transplants  are a good idea in principle  the trouble is that there are a huge number of variables at work in this  and our understanding of things is still pretty basic  to start with  intestinal flora contains around 3001000 different kinds of bacteria in a healthy person  of which only 3040 kinds dominate  taking almost all the available space and these can be subdivided into two major phyla  the upper intestinal bacteria  which are aerobic and digest the food we eat efficiently  and the lower  colon bacteria  which are anaerobic  and much less efficient the latter are still very good to have in the colon  but anywhere else in the body and they are pathogens  in addition  the most common microorganisms in our flora are viruses  of a vast but undetermined number  most of which are bacteriophage  which means they eat bacteria but there are also fungi and yeasts  protozoa  parasites  and archaea  that look like bacteria but are nt  and all of them are interactive with each other and our immune system  so  with fecal transplants  we are at the level of   it  the floral mix  works for somebody else  so if we transplant it  maybe it will work for you ,d01xgtq,offbeat,news,1455635149,WendyLRogers3,2,0,428,85670,0.0

while i think  fecal transplants  are a good idea in principle  the trouble is that there are a huge number of variables at work in this  and our understanding of things is still pretty basic  to start with  intestinal flora contains around 3001000 different kinds of bacteria in a healthy person  of which only 3040 kinds dominate  taking almost all the available space and these can be subdivided into two major phyla  the upper intestinal bacteria  which are aerobic and digest the food we eat efficiently  and the lower  colon bacteria  which are anaerobic  and much less efficient the latter are still very good to have in the colon  but anywhere else in the body and they are pathogens  in addition  the most common microorganisms in our flora are viruses  of a vast but undetermined number  most of which are bacteriophage  which means they eat bacteria but there are also fungi and yeasts  protozoa  parasites  and archaea  that look like bacteria but are nt  and all of them are interactive with each other and our immune system  so  with fecal transplants  we are at the level of   it  the floral mix  works for somebody else  so if we transplant it  maybe it will work for you ,d01xgtq,offbeat,news,1455635149,WendyLRogers3,2,0,428,85670,0.0

i believe it former journalism outfits that had name recognition are basically stooping to the level of a blogger or ad network that will put out knowingly incorrect information or will sometimes just straight up lie in order to create a graph showing the number of hits their articles are hitting so they can sell the traffic to the highest bidder  these outfits do nt have to worry about their names being tarnished bc they can just start up a new site  migrate the content and no one is the wiser  there is a great book written by ryan holiday in which he spent about 6 months claiming to be an expert on a site journalist use who are already know what they want to say but need a source to quote  he was quoted as an expert in fields he had no clue about  in several very reputable organizations articles  nyt  washington post   he used his real name the entire time and all the  journalist  would have had to do was do even minimal research to discover he had already gotten a ton of press exposing media corruption  eventually he had his assistant pretending to be him and he was still getting quoted  the great part was once he revealed he had basically duped all these publishing outfits they were outraged at him for lying nevermind the fact the journalist did no fact checking whatsoever and in some cases never communicated with him in any form other than email  this is the type of journalistic integrity we have going on so i absolutely believe this ,d015aen,offbeat,news,1455573919,mymainthrowaway,18,0,10,765,0.0
