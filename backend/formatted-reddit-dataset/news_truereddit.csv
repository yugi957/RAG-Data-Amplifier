the author  a journalist  notes that coverage of antivaccination efforts have a surprisingly long history  dating back to the 1980s  and points out that these articles have been couched in the same way throughout  with antivaccination views derided as antiscience further noting that explanation of the science did not actually change the views of antivaccination advocates  she digs deeper and finds that many of these views were not so much a rejection of the science as they were a rejection of the idea that they should accept individual risk  for their children  for the public good in paying closer attention to what these advocates have said  she argues that their views are largely antiauthoritarian  resisting  mandatory  vaccination  rather than antiscience  rejecting or misunderstanding the  fact  of public benefit from vaccination   and posits that this makes it a moral rather than scientific debate  with implications for the relevant publichealth communications ,d02hkgj,truereddit,news,1455663149.0,oklos,2.0,0.0,450,3095,0.0

while i agree that it is nt right to outright dehumanize and abuse politics candidates because you disagree with them  i disagree with much of the rest of this the article presumes that someone who supports sanders out to also not oppose clinton but i do nt like clinton nor her policies i do nt trust note believe in her i do have some trust in sanders and support him  if clinton is the candidate  i will not vote for her i believe she would be a poor president and do nt agree with her past activities so why should i vote for her  i am not a democrat i am independenti vote for individual candidates that i like just because clinton decides one month to begin espousing most of the same or similar concerts to sanders does not mean that i believe she is sincere or committed to them she it s historically wishywashy she is an opportunist in the most negative way that i can say it  in my opinion at least  she is a politician  does that mean that people should dehumanize and abuse her  no absolutely not but she does and says things that i do nt like i would wager that many of sander s supporters are not loyal democrats they have no party ties to clinton and may not turn out to vote at all if sanders is not the candidate  i do agree with another part of that blog though yes  i know that sanders is not likely to be the democratic candidates he was always a long shot candidate and i believe that the democratic party hardliners do not want him there they are committed to clinton and it will take a huge amount of popular support to change their minds however  i think it is important to tell them that many sanders supporters will not vote for clinton they need to understand that for him to even have a shot ,czzk14b,truereddit,news,1455460310.0,continuumcomplex,3.0,0.0,5360,2487,0.0

it is actually quite interesting  sort of the in background to common core  and a lot of the philosophy that guided those standards  creation come from this  there is currently a revolution going on in the way we teach math curriculum the focus has shifted to understanding by design  rather than understanding by practice it s hard to point to a few things that really emphasize this change  but it s present in all of the teacher preparation courses math teachers are encouraged to use projects  real examples  and other ways to connect to the student  while assigning less repetitive homework and focusing more on getting students to explain why this means that students are regularly communicating and articulating logic  which is the whole point of math education and students are better prepared for the complex logic involved in higher math  the real interesting part is that this is sort of creating a divide in math departments the old guard is used to not having to deeply explain why foil  binomial distribution  works  for instance  and the young teachers can get sort of frustrated at the lack of guidance since the whole culture is changing the older teachers now have to catch up as prescribed by their admin  which means the younger teachers are thrust into leadership roles all of this turmoil means that some teachers are retiring early  making a big gap that needs to be filled there s some real radical movement happening  it s a great time to be a math teacher ,czzkrjr,truereddit,news,1455462066.0,MoopleDoople,14.0,0.0,1,263,0.0

it is actually quite interesting  sort of the in background to common core  and a lot of the philosophy that guided those standards  creation come from this  there is currently a revolution going on in the way we teach math curriculum the focus has shifted to understanding by design  rather than understanding by practice it s hard to point to a few things that really emphasize this change  but it s present in all of the teacher preparation courses math teachers are encouraged to use projects  real examples  and other ways to connect to the student  while assigning less repetitive homework and focusing more on getting students to explain why this means that students are regularly communicating and articulating logic  which is the whole point of math education and students are better prepared for the complex logic involved in higher math  the real interesting part is that this is sort of creating a divide in math departments the old guard is used to not having to deeply explain why foil  binomial distribution  works  for instance  and the young teachers can get sort of frustrated at the lack of guidance since the whole culture is changing the older teachers now have to catch up as prescribed by their admin  which means the younger teachers are thrust into leadership roles all of this turmoil means that some teachers are retiring early  making a big gap that needs to be filled there s some real radical movement happening  it s a great time to be a math teacher ,czzkrjr,truereddit,news,1455462066.0,MoopleDoople,14.0,0.0,1,263,0.0

there are lots of factors at stake  and predatory colleges  particularly nonaccredited trade or online schools built to soak up your federal loan money  are a problem i think the biggest factor  however  is a lack of bluecollar jobs it used to be that getting a college degree was not strictly necessary for the average person to do well  much less get by getting a college degree  therefore  almost guaranteed that you would do well with the loss of jobs which did not require an education  you have a flood of people who are still trying to make good on the promise that education  success but like any market  it is now saturated  so it becomes less true  i do nt know what the answers are but i do nt like most of those given usually it s  everyone should just study science or programming  that s a shortterm solution that will only flood those disciplines in a similar way  though there are social benefits to a more scientific society   it also risks further turning education into employeetraining instead of making engaged citizens and imaginative entrepreneurs  anyway  i m just tired of hating on college education it s not the education  per se  that is the problem but a larger social and economic trend that s been in motion for a few decades now ,d01xb97,truereddit,news,1455634874.0,Dicknosed_Shitlicker,4.0,0.0,2129,15312,0.0

the author  a journalist  notes that coverage of antivaccination efforts have a surprisingly long history  dating back to the 1980s  and points out that these articles have been couched in the same way throughout  with antivaccination views derided as antiscience further noting that explanation of the science did not actually change the views of antivaccination advocates  she digs deeper and finds that many of these views were not so much a rejection of the science as they were a rejection of the idea that they should accept individual risk  for their children  for the public good in paying closer attention to what these advocates have said  she argues that their views are largely antiauthoritarian  resisting  mandatory  vaccination  rather than antiscience  rejecting or misunderstanding the  fact  of public benefit from vaccination   and posits that this makes it a moral rather than scientific debate  with implications for the relevant publichealth communications ,d02hkgj,truereddit,news,1455663149.0,oklos,2.0,0.0,450,3095,0.0

ha  even though i dispute quite a lot of the facts and stats quoted in this i take the point about generalising  how you can construct a narrative from effective rhetoric and picking the right facts and telling people what they want to hear basically also that there is another side to the story and it s good to get perspective of how western culture is viewed this bit is an example of the disingenuous  imo  use of stats gt  other than india and zimbabwe  the rest of the top 10 countries with the highest incidence of rape in the world are western  is sort of taking advantage of the different laws on various sexual crimes and understanding of them in the western world and much of the developing world  iirc when similar victim surveys of sexual and domestic violence  that may or may not be worthy of generalisation to a larger population  have been done they seem to show women in the developing world  including large parts of the muslim world  generally report a higher rate of sexual assault and domestic violence  and the ones i ve seen that include men suggest that this might be true of the rate of perpetration by women aswell but i think they could both have an element of truth to them  especially the depression and loneliness in  especially anglo saxon   western countries  though i m not sure this is related to sexual openness even if it is true   and i think that evidence from western countries about decreasing rates of sexual crime in the last 40 or so years of increasing sexual openness seems to contradict it  i think it is an interesting question whether people would accept higher rates of a crime for more sexual freedom and openness and some degree of public separation of the sexes andor restriction on taboo sexual practices etc  though it s not universal in muslim countries   i do think that poverty  endogamy  especially arranged marriages who s aim is to preserve family assets  and polygamy are correlated with a large surplus of single men who can not marry  this is true of western countries with relative poverty and negligable endogamypolygamy etc  and have no public sexual outlet which is nt taboo  strained and fraught relationships between the sexes and a greater number of marriages where romantic love is secondary to being partners but i do remember some stuff suggesting that the separation of the sexes  of public and private and dress codes etc might produce stronger more intense relationships between couples the surplus  of young men is associated with social turmoil and upheaval  the conservative attitude to sex in public  which you could see in the chief objection that sex is everywhere   which is common in lots of places in the developing world  seems to just push things under the rug there are many of the same things as this person decries in the west going on in conservative countries  drug use  pre marital sex  homosexual sex  even though they do nt mention it  but they are in the shadows with people finding their own way and often not practising safe sex etc  in much of western culture in the last century or so is those cultures coming out into the mainstream ,d02affr,truereddit,news,1455653498.0,lurker093287h,1.0,0.0,5081,57519,0.0

ha  even though i dispute quite a lot of the facts and stats quoted in this i take the point about generalising  how you can construct a narrative from effective rhetoric and picking the right facts and telling people what they want to hear basically also that there is another side to the story and it s good to get perspective of how western culture is viewed this bit is an example of the disingenuous  imo  use of stats gt  other than india and zimbabwe  the rest of the top 10 countries with the highest incidence of rape in the world are western  is sort of taking advantage of the different laws on various sexual crimes and understanding of them in the western world and much of the developing world  iirc when similar victim surveys of sexual and domestic violence  that may or may not be worthy of generalisation to a larger population  have been done they seem to show women in the developing world  including large parts of the muslim world  generally report a higher rate of sexual assault and domestic violence  and the ones i ve seen that include men suggest that this might be true of the rate of perpetration by women aswell but i think they could both have an element of truth to them  especially the depression and loneliness in  especially anglo saxon   western countries  though i m not sure this is related to sexual openness even if it is true   and i think that evidence from western countries about decreasing rates of sexual crime in the last 40 or so years of increasing sexual openness seems to contradict it  i think it is an interesting question whether people would accept higher rates of a crime for more sexual freedom and openness and some degree of public separation of the sexes andor restriction on taboo sexual practices etc  though it s not universal in muslim countries   i do think that poverty  endogamy  especially arranged marriages who s aim is to preserve family assets  and polygamy are correlated with a large surplus of single men who can not marry  this is true of western countries with relative poverty and negligable endogamypolygamy etc  and have no public sexual outlet which is nt taboo  strained and fraught relationships between the sexes and a greater number of marriages where romantic love is secondary to being partners but i do remember some stuff suggesting that the separation of the sexes  of public and private and dress codes etc might produce stronger more intense relationships between couples the surplus  of young men is associated with social turmoil and upheaval  the conservative attitude to sex in public  which you could see in the chief objection that sex is everywhere   which is common in lots of places in the developing world  seems to just push things under the rug there are many of the same things as this person decries in the west going on in conservative countries  drug use  pre marital sex  homosexual sex  even though they do nt mention it  but they are in the shadows with people finding their own way and often not practising safe sex etc  in much of western culture in the last century or so is those cultures coming out into the mainstream ,d02affr,truereddit,news,1455653498.0,lurker093287h,1.0,0.0,5081,57519,0.0

imo the way to understand this article is not in terms of polarization across party lines  but that the cultural old guard of bitter white conservatives are increasingly becoming separate from the rest of american society  committed republicans represent only an utterly homogeneous group of white rural voters of increasingly dwindling numbers and influence on the other hand  democrats represent  everyone else   right now these groups are sort of balanced in political power and population  but that wo nt last  what we re seeing is the cultural right becoming an insular pariah group  whereas what we now think of now as the  left  is essentially welcoming and inclusive and represents all the genuine diversity of american culture right now this is nt as obvious because the right is still so  big   but as it shrinks in the coming decades  i think this will become more clear ,d02g6l6,truereddit,news,1455661174.0,Bitterfish,1.0,0.0,1133,17039,0.0

it is actually quite interesting  sort of the in background to common core  and a lot of the philosophy that guided those standards  creation come from this  there is currently a revolution going on in the way we teach math curriculum the focus has shifted to understanding by design  rather than understanding by practice it s hard to point to a few things that really emphasize this change  but it s present in all of the teacher preparation courses math teachers are encouraged to use projects  real examples  and other ways to connect to the student  while assigning less repetitive homework and focusing more on getting students to explain why this means that students are regularly communicating and articulating logic  which is the whole point of math education and students are better prepared for the complex logic involved in higher math  the real interesting part is that this is sort of creating a divide in math departments the old guard is used to not having to deeply explain why foil  binomial distribution  works  for instance  and the young teachers can get sort of frustrated at the lack of guidance since the whole culture is changing the older teachers now have to catch up as prescribed by their admin  which means the younger teachers are thrust into leadership roles all of this turmoil means that some teachers are retiring early  making a big gap that needs to be filled there s some real radical movement happening  it s a great time to be a math teacher ,czzkrjr,truereddit,news,1455462066.0,MoopleDoople,14.0,0.0,1,263,0.0

even aside from the issues about it being gamed  something that i agree is extremely likely to happen  another issue is that it will simply result in every popular thread being removed  every so often this sub will have a topic that gets a lot of attention that means a lot of upvotes  a lot of visibility and a lot of comments comments that will inevitably disagree with the topic and will object to the thread on a partisan basis it would nt even take abuse the more visible a topic is  the more people there will be who strongly disagree with the article  for reasons that are legitimate to them  and would like to see it gone  inevitably every popular thread would be removed by a 3 count  maybe even a 10 count  regardless of the actual quality of the article   especially  if it s about a controversial issue such as gun control or abortion where people have strong beliefs so this would scale horribly for popular topics ,czbw1jr,truereddit,news,1453767264.0,GenocidalElectricFan,13.0,0.0,10,3331,0.0

this seems like a silly idea that is just begging to be gamed and abused there are currently 273 people in true reddit right now so 1  of the current users can now unilaterally get submissions removed  this seems like the complete opposite of empowering the community while at the same time not producing any benefit to the quality of submissions  i would actually prefer that moderators use a more heavy handed approach in curating articles and removing garbage content saying power to the community is in theory a wonderful idea  but the reason this sub even exists is due to the fact that reddit s community is largely more interested in beating dead horses and making asinine and often inappropriate jokes to reap the ever valuable karma points even here  i ve noticed a greater tendency for people to prioritize their desire to appear a wit than to contribute anything worth thinking about and this applies to submissions as well as comments moderation for the sake of moderation is not a virtue ,cz9rtzx,truereddit,news,1453615624.0,trap_haus,13.0,0.0,593,644,0.0

you may find this related oped from 5 years ago interesting   is academia inhospitable to big discoveries    http  wwwcreativitypostcomeducationis_academia_inhospitable_to_big_discoveries  it was written in reaction to the failed attempt by vinay deolalikar to prove that p and np are unequal  you may note in the article that the author mentions that the proof had nt been discredited yet   even though deolalikar s attempt was nt successful  i think that s beside the main point  which is that the attempt could not have happened at all in public research  ie  at a modern university   check out  deolalikar s publication record   http  academicresearchmicrosoftcomauthor44439vinaydeolalikar  and notice   1  how scant it is for a researcher of his calibre  in public research he would probably have 510x as many publications   and  2  a 3year gap between 2006 and 2009  leading up to the p   np attempt  where he published  nothing at all   the notion that a prominent researcher could go 3 years without a publication is pretty much impossible in universities today were he working at a university instead of hp labs  he d have to focus his attention either on very small problems  or problems which can be solved incrementally  the  salami  model that s typically used in public research  where you break a larger problem down into 6month salami  slices   this model does nt fit with his approach to the p   np problem ,d00lz2o,truereddit,news,1455543462.0,OlderThanGif,3.0,0.0,2194,31982,0.0
so it s important to note that einstein did not come up through the university system he worked odd jobs  including as a patent clerk  that supported his lifestyle while giving him time to think deep thoughts he was not part of the university system until he had gained some fame for his work in fact  he became part of the university system because  while he had the conceptual ideas  he had to enlist help from mathematicians to develop the mathematical concepts to make his ideas predictive  there is no new einstein because 1  there are no einsteins left  the one we had has passed away some time ago  and 2  new questions in physics have nt revealed themselves yet the university system is a useful indoctrination of sorts it teaches kids to think and explore  but only from a rearward perspective even graduate school is a study in incrementalism and that is extremely important  ideas need incubation and deep thought from many minds to become useful but revolutionary ideas do not  in general  come up through the university system ,czzsuaq,truereddit,news,1455476593.0,brierrat,23.0,0.0,1,3821,0.0
