it s amazing how the international politics are working out on a daily basis  or my reddit based view of it  which i am sure is just what reddit collectively upvotes  so not necessarily entirely accurate   us and allies wanted assad out  so they did nt want to completely wipe out isis this suited turkey and of course saudi arabia  us did nt want turkey  saudi  isis completely win the situation  so they established their own power on the ground thru al qaeda renamed as al nusra  us and allies completely controlling syria does nt suit russia so they started support assad by bombing al nusra amp  isis  us did nt want to go all out war with russia over syria  and yet russian bombing their terrorists on the ground turkey could nt believe what they are seeing  so they tries to provoke the situation by shooting down russian jet  which actually helps russian cause  and entirely backfires on turkey as they quickly become a liability to nato  now russians are moving diplomatically  and so is iran and are working close with french and us  and turkey is left high and dry as well as saudi arabia who really wanted to cut off iranian gas amp  oil getting to europe thru syria  i do nt know what saudi s new game is  first they announce massive war games  and now they are cutting deals with russians on oil production  russians can bring iranians to the table as well  which should pretty much stop the oil price war as far as i can see are russians winning the diplomacy game  and are saudi recognizing it and changing tact  if saudi really can change their game  they will come out reasonably well from this mess  it s better to alight with russia and fight isis than align with isis and fight russia  next couple of weeks  months are going to be really interesting in that region i am sure us has another tact  plan already in action  i do nt for a second believe they would sit back and let russia win friends and influence in that region ,d01yozt,worldnews,news,1455637189.0,antipositron,17.0,0.0,22.0,10429.0,0.0
