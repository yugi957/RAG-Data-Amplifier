i think the whole thing blindsided gus it was nt just that walt murdered two drug dealers with his car  it was also that the dealers had killed that child they hired i do nt believe gus ever meant for them to do that when he said  no more kids   he would have wanted jesse to approach him so he could deal with his employees himself after all  even if gus could nt care less about the child  having his drug dealers commit that murder drew a huge amount of media and law enforcement attention it was a dumb move  period but instead  jesse went after the drug dealers and walt killed them boom more media and law enforcement attention gus had to be furious and a bit overwhelmed  i feel like he probably thought of walt as a safe bet walt is a family man  a teacher  and dying of cancer he s apologetic and collapses under pressure if i were gus  i d never expect walt to go out and run over two drug dealers walt proved himself to be unpredictable and dangerous by doing that therefore  he was a risk gus did nt care to take any longer  gus understood walt s pleas to protect jesse  i think the fact that he met with jesse and heard him out when jesse planned to poison the drug dealers speaks to that jesse at that point was nothing to gus but gus understood he meant the world to walt he gave jesse a chance  and even told him that walt was the only reason jesse got that chance  i do think gus understood walt s reasons for killing the dealers to protect and support jesse but i also think that was nt a factor in whether walt was to live gus had gale  who was thoroughly innocuous  sweet  and consistently loyal gale knew the recipe walt  on the other hand  had just shown his volatility which is the last thing gus needed if he wanted to stay hidden in plain sight i think he decided to have walt killed not because he could nt understand why walt killed the dealers  but because walt  like victor a few episodes later  had become a liability ,czuegkj,breakingbad,television,1455078161,Amblonyx,3,0,1,5962,0.0
there may have been more to motivate walt than just altruism by keeping jesse in his corner  he was close with the only person who might  theoretically  be able to replace him as a cook this gave him leverage over gus that he would not have with gale as an assistant ,czu3atu,breakingbad,television,1455061301,HarlanCedeno,1,0,307,48779,1.0

gus s reaction to walter s actions in halfmeasure  murdering two of his dealers to save jesse  are to kill walter at the first opportunity as long at the cook can continue without him if anyone could understand walter s actions should nt it be gus who lost his best friendpossible lover to the cartel setting up a 20 year revenge scheme  up until the flashback introduction of max  gus seemed emotionless and i assumed he just did nt understand the loyaltyfriendship between walter and jesse but after that it seems like a real blind spot for him to care so deeply about max to the point where he d betray his employer and yet not understand walter s feelings about jesse and what he d do to protect him ,44zeup,breakingbad,television,1455057654,Daniel_Bryan_Fan,1,0,1,479,0.0

i personally think making a show mainly about saul is hitting 2 birds with 1 stone with this show they can easily show mike s storyline along with saul s  if the show was mainly about mike then they would ve had trouble exposing saul s storyline  i think it has generally to do with how the characters intercept with one another  saul s arc is a pivot around which other characters  lives revolve he was the one with all the connections making the show about him was a smart move ,d013g5k,breakingbad,television,1455571214,yoyo9797,2,0,2,2970,0.0

skyler smoking is definitely not the most disturbing thing in breaking bad i realize you are only in season two so wo nt spoil future events  but melting bodies in acid and having to mop up the remains from season 1 is way more disturbing than smoking  i hate smoking  too but this backlash against smokers is pretty silly my mom and grandmothers all smoked while they were pregnant  way more than a single puff and me and my cousins and aunts and uncles all turned out fine it is nt healthy  but seriously murder and dismemberment is much grosser ,czvk3af,breakingbad,television,1455157648,CMelody,17,0,15325,46039,0.0

i think season 5 is well done and makes sense visavis the rest of the series  but i personally did nt enjoy it as much because it had fewer light moments and comic relief also  jesse  who could be counted upon in previous seasons to be somewhat of a funny character  totally declined in the last season again  his decline and fall made sense but it was nt as fun to watch also  previous seasons had walt struggling with his own moral decline  and in season 5 he seems to be more of a complete psycho totally makes sense  but it s harder to watch season 5 is also interesting in that the audience is once again put in a strange dilemma of disliking skyler and rooting for walt  especially in the scene where he has the nearaly 10 million dollars in the barrel on the driveway and tells his family they have to run for it  but skyler grandstands and closes this particular window of opportunity the audience may find themselves saying   who does this hypocritical bag of garbage think she is  after all the selfserving things she s done  now she wants to climb on the moral high horse again   her facial expressions and gesticulations during the argument were also  i believe  carefully orchestrated to make the audience hate her and want to slap her  and then question their own priorities because walt himself is a murderous  psychotic monster really effective filmmaking  yet uncomfortable to watch ,czmvkn0,breakingbad,television,1454540730,BingeWatchLikeWhoa,2,0,1,17,0.0

it was his aunt s house they never discussed the specifics of aunt ginny s will and who inherited the house  but his parents did mention that jesse did not own the house but they were planning on splitting the proceeds of the home sale that s why jesse had the real estate agent showing his home in season one  when the pinkmans discovered the meth lab  they decided to cut jesse out and sell it on their own i can understand why they would not want him living in the house if he was cooking in it  it would make the home too hard to sell  but it was wrong to cut him out of the monetary proceeds when that is what they had agreed upon in the past  if you think about it  the pinkmans got exactly the amount of money  half the market value  they were supposed to get if they d split the sale proceeds in the first place  so while it was underhanded how jesse acquired the house  they were nt shorted any money ,d02qnga,breakingbad,television,1455677162,CMelody,1,0,15325,46039,0.0

jesse  tries  to reconcile  in s3 e2 when he sees they are selling the house jesse actually seems peaceful and over his anger at being thrown out of the house aunt ginny left to him he d been through worse between then and now   and is lonely  he  politely  asks his dad if he can see inside before it is sold   no  but the pictures are on the website   then jesse asks if he can come by for dinner sometime  sometime  says his dad reluctantly before leaving  obviously a no  this is at a time when jesse is still getting over the loss of jane and listening to her voicemail over and over  he s actually needs his family asking to come to dinner was his asking them to accept him back in their lives  also   you doing okay     yeah yeah  i m good  he ca nt even tell them about the recent devastation with his girlfriend dying  they  cut off communication with him if they had bothered to check up on him occasionally  such as a quick phonecall once a month  they might have actually have known about this yeah i know he s an adult but parents should be there for the troublesome son when he s having a major trauma  the fact they treat him as a lost cause is awful in my opinion  anyway at the end of the episode jesse s just like  screw em  then uses saul to blackmail them into selling the house back to him at a low cost i think it was no longer about the fact they threw him out and totally about the fact they made clear  no more contact  however  i imagine jesse might one day reconnect with his little brother he cares about him and is proud of him ,czqg44j,breakingbad,television,1454799939,LYRAA3,9,0,117,2453,0.0

at one point the vacuum cleaner guy is on the phone asking someone about a grade of mild steel i ve assumed that this is referencing the gas truck that he sneaks walt across the country in  it seems clever at first but think about it for a 2200 mile trip  a gas truck  think how slow and uncomfortable the thing would ve been he would ve had to find diesel at every fill up being so slow  he would ve had to stop overnight probably twice so does walt stay in the back of the truck or does he crawl out and get a room  risking exposure  walt was not dressed or equipped to ride all that way in the tank of the gas truck  no sleeping bag  no light  no food  no nothing when he climbed out  he was woefully underdressed for a new england winter too  he d have frozen his ass off on the ride  that and if the gas truck came all the way from albuquerque  it d be suspicious as hell that it s riding around new hampshire anything would ve been less suspicious  if the truck did nt come all the way from albuquerque then why bother with the transfer and wasting the money to gasfree and cut up a gas truck for the last bit of a ride that is going to end at a completely private place anyway  and where did all of walt s stuff come from  how did it get to nh  the shot of him climbing out of the gas tank showed nothing else in there  it seemed clever at first but it just seems silly to me after some thought can someone set me straight on this  would nt walt riding in back of a tinted suburban have been much easier and less risky ,4508uo,breakingbad,television,1455068641,chief_dirtypants,1,0,1,9767,0.0

i never hated him or anyone else in the show  but i found him annoying toward the end of the series  especially when it became obvious that  even when presented with many opportunities to leave the meth business  he chose to stay in it for the sake of his own ego he would pay lip service to the idea that he was still doing it all for his family  and no doubt they would be beneficiaries in a monetary sense after his inevitable death  but that made him annoying to me because it seemed clear he was just feeding his own ego one is led to think  okay  walt  your wife is obviously a selfentitled  useless loser who disrespects you  so why do you keep kowtowing to her and letting her foil your plans  i think it all comes back to the ego thing he wants control  and despite skyler s many  many flaws  she refuses to be controlled whether or not her motives are from massive hypocrisy and selfserving vanity are irrelevant to the fact that she will not give walt what he wants she clearly does nt do anything with him sexually alright  then does she at least respect him  is she nice to him  and appreciative of the things he does for her  absolutely not in fact she is the opposite in every way  and yet she benefits fromand demands to have control overthe dirty money she professes to be disgusted by   audience members are asking themselves   what does walt see in this pathetic woman  who is not even on the same planet as him intellectually  yet treats him like he s an idiot   i think the answer is he just wants to be powerful there s a strong hint early in the series where a pregnant skyler offers to get a job  when they re discussing money walt says no why  probably because he likes the idea of making money  and being the only one in the family with power to make money  and he likes the idea of people depending on him it s a normal feeling and lots of people are like that the gus speech about what it is to be a man   even if no one appreciates it   underlines this theme skyler is a prototypical ungrateful  entitled spouse who has a million opinions but  in the end  is merely a reactor rather than a creator butyeah  walt became annoying when he did nt just ditch that broad  send walter jr and holly checks addressed only to them  and marry some hot russian model who would at least pretend to like him and make him feel like a big shot ,czmwjud,breakingbad,television,1454542218,BingeWatchLikeWhoa,6,0,1,17,0.0

sleeping pills bc he d been up all night stressed while fixating on this fly  i always wondered if the implication was that  even maybe unintentionally  walt had gotten high from working in the lab he displays somewhat methlike behavior in this episode i do nt think walt would intentionally use the product  that d be out of character i d think i was a madman if it were nt for the fact that jesse asks directly and did nt get an answer as though walt  when asked by jesse immediately realizes that s a possibility  some kind of contact high from working in the lab jesse  too  assuming that s the case  knew to use sleeping pills from his time as an addict it s just ambiguous enough to be uncertain  and the writers are known for their attention to detail it is a pretty convenient explanation of walt s unusually erratic behavior in this episode,d01180i,breakingbad,television,1455568028,JeffroTheMan,1,0,17,654,0.0

it was nt so much control  as it was trying to make walter fall on the sword just as walter was manipulating jesse  gus was manipulating the situation so that it d be only a matter of time before jesse  cracks  and allows gus to get rid of walter by driving a wedge between them and breaking off contact  all gus had to do was pray that walter fucks up so badly that jesse wants him dead and then he d fulfill his goal if gus allowed walter to have contact with jesse  he knows he wo nt be able to kill him because he knows jesse is somewhat attached to him  also  the dialogue   i do not believe fear to be an effective motivator  is the definition of irony if it was nt for gus threatening walter  walter would never have the motivation to be so drastic and kill gus at the same time  we know that gus was a very calm guy he managed to create and sustain an empire for 20 years  likely by acting so calm  and yet  it s only when he starts to act cold  and driven by instilling fear that his empire starts to go downhill ,czyzgtb,breakingbad,television,1455408109,HowToBeaGoodLeader,1,0,1,887,0.0

watch for ironic things they say and do  that indicate things that will come back to bite them later it s everywhere  in every episode  for example here is a scene where hank jokingly makes a motion at his own head with his hand  season 2 is rife with hints of jane dying and aviation disasters i thought you would nt wake up   ever   don complaining they ca nt get reliable staff at the airport  eep   this guy wants a new tat  of a helicopter going up in flames   watch for similarities between characters  how they mirror eachother for example  lydia says something that is the same as tuco  a sign of foreboding walt gently rests his daughter holly on her side so we will not choke  but in the same episode he wont do it for jane don and walt were similar loving fathers  see how jane projects her annoyance at her own father onto walt as soon as walt tells her what to do  notice cinematography as well as story look at symbolism  like the use of ladders and stairs and climbing  falling  and going updown in elevators going up is progressive  positive  escape  enlightenment  gon na do something positive  promotion   going down is negative  imprisoned  depressed  gon na do something bad  demotion  fired   look at pictures on walls in the background stuff like that also  standing in shadow vs standing in light walking into shadow  bad  stripey half light  vague  look how many devilreferences there are towards walt and how the underground lab is like hell with it s red floor and atrocities happening watch fly and imagine the lab represents walt s mind and he s going insane from guilt and locking  jesse out etc the fly is that feeling he ca nt get rid of jesse goes up his ladder of goodness and forgives walt saying it was nt your fault  and kills the fly at the same time look at colours  like jesse wearing yellow  red black or grey refelects his mood same with walt but walt s colours are mainly green  white  later black etc  imagine phoenixabq and peekaboo are kind of the same but in phoenix walt is jesse and jesse is drug abuse kid ,czyg0ln,breakingbad,television,1455372011,LYRAA3,12,0,117,2453,0.0

gus s reaction to walter s actions in halfmeasure  murdering two of his dealers to save jesse  are to kill walter at the first opportunity as long at the cook can continue without him if anyone could understand walter s actions should nt it be gus who lost his best friendpossible lover to the cartel setting up a 20 year revenge scheme  up until the flashback introduction of max  gus seemed emotionless and i assumed he just did nt understand the loyaltyfriendship between walter and jesse but after that it seems like a real blind spot for him to care so deeply about max to the point where he d betray his employer and yet not understand walter s feelings about jesse and what he d do to protect him ,44zeup,breakingbad,television,1455057654,Daniel_Bryan_Fan,1,0,1,479,0.0
i think the whole thing blindsided gus it was nt just that walt murdered two drug dealers with his car  it was also that the dealers had killed that child they hired i do nt believe gus ever meant for them to do that when he said  no more kids   he would have wanted jesse to approach him so he could deal with his employees himself after all  even if gus could nt care less about the child  having his drug dealers commit that murder drew a huge amount of media and law enforcement attention it was a dumb move  period but instead  jesse went after the drug dealers and walt killed them boom more media and law enforcement attention gus had to be furious and a bit overwhelmed  i feel like he probably thought of walt as a safe bet walt is a family man  a teacher  and dying of cancer he s apologetic and collapses under pressure if i were gus  i d never expect walt to go out and run over two drug dealers walt proved himself to be unpredictable and dangerous by doing that therefore  he was a risk gus did nt care to take any longer  gus understood walt s pleas to protect jesse  i think the fact that he met with jesse and heard him out when jesse planned to poison the drug dealers speaks to that jesse at that point was nothing to gus but gus understood he meant the world to walt he gave jesse a chance  and even told him that walt was the only reason jesse got that chance  i do think gus understood walt s reasons for killing the dealers to protect and support jesse but i also think that was nt a factor in whether walt was to live gus had gale  who was thoroughly innocuous  sweet  and consistently loyal gale knew the recipe walt  on the other hand  had just shown his volatility which is the last thing gus needed if he wanted to stay hidden in plain sight i think he decided to have walt killed not because he could nt understand why walt killed the dealers  but because walt  like victor a few episodes later  had become a liability ,czuegkj,breakingbad,television,1455078161,Amblonyx,3,0,1,5962,0.0
there may have been more to motivate walt than just altruism by keeping jesse in his corner  he was close with the only person who might  theoretically  be able to replace him as a cook this gave him leverage over gus that he would not have with gale as an assistant ,czu3atu,breakingbad,television,1455061301,HarlanCedeno,1,0,307,48779,1.0

i never hated him or anyone else in the show  but i found him annoying toward the end of the series  especially when it became obvious that  even when presented with many opportunities to leave the meth business  he chose to stay in it for the sake of his own ego he would pay lip service to the idea that he was still doing it all for his family  and no doubt they would be beneficiaries in a monetary sense after his inevitable death  but that made him annoying to me because it seemed clear he was just feeding his own ego one is led to think  okay  walt  your wife is obviously a selfentitled  useless loser who disrespects you  so why do you keep kowtowing to her and letting her foil your plans  i think it all comes back to the ego thing he wants control  and despite skyler s many  many flaws  she refuses to be controlled whether or not her motives are from massive hypocrisy and selfserving vanity are irrelevant to the fact that she will not give walt what he wants she clearly does nt do anything with him sexually alright  then does she at least respect him  is she nice to him  and appreciative of the things he does for her  absolutely not in fact she is the opposite in every way  and yet she benefits fromand demands to have control overthe dirty money she professes to be disgusted by   audience members are asking themselves   what does walt see in this pathetic woman  who is not even on the same planet as him intellectually  yet treats him like he s an idiot   i think the answer is he just wants to be powerful there s a strong hint early in the series where a pregnant skyler offers to get a job  when they re discussing money walt says no why  probably because he likes the idea of making money  and being the only one in the family with power to make money  and he likes the idea of people depending on him it s a normal feeling and lots of people are like that the gus speech about what it is to be a man   even if no one appreciates it   underlines this theme skyler is a prototypical ungrateful  entitled spouse who has a million opinions but  in the end  is merely a reactor rather than a creator butyeah  walt became annoying when he did nt just ditch that broad  send walter jr and holly checks addressed only to them  and marry some hot russian model who would at least pretend to like him and make him feel like a big shot ,czmwjud,breakingbad,television,1454542218,BingeWatchLikeWhoa,6,0,1,17,0.0

jesse  tries  to reconcile  in s3 e2 when he sees they are selling the house jesse actually seems peaceful and over his anger at being thrown out of the house aunt ginny left to him he d been through worse between then and now   and is lonely  he  politely  asks his dad if he can see inside before it is sold   no  but the pictures are on the website   then jesse asks if he can come by for dinner sometime  sometime  says his dad reluctantly before leaving  obviously a no  this is at a time when jesse is still getting over the loss of jane and listening to her voicemail over and over  he s actually needs his family asking to come to dinner was his asking them to accept him back in their lives  also   you doing okay     yeah yeah  i m good  he ca nt even tell them about the recent devastation with his girlfriend dying  they  cut off communication with him if they had bothered to check up on him occasionally  such as a quick phonecall once a month  they might have actually have known about this yeah i know he s an adult but parents should be there for the troublesome son when he s having a major trauma  the fact they treat him as a lost cause is awful in my opinion  anyway at the end of the episode jesse s just like  screw em  then uses saul to blackmail them into selling the house back to him at a low cost i think it was no longer about the fact they threw him out and totally about the fact they made clear  no more contact  however  i imagine jesse might one day reconnect with his little brother he cares about him and is proud of him ,czqg44j,breakingbad,television,1454799939,LYRAA3,9,0,117,2453,0.0
i think the general opinion for almost every character changes as the story goes deeper at first  i felt sorry for the pinkmans  because it was clear that jesse had put them through hell as the story progressed  after they disowned him  they became condescending towards him the magic of it is  they were always like that you can see how their lofty expectations clashed with jesse s independence and willfulness even in their first appearance but it s also clear that they truly loved their son up until they released him it s a layered relationship what did you think of them ,czq8ip6,breakingbad,television,1454786315,amonkappeared,4,0,1,1865,0.0
his parents are never shown again after season 3  i do feel bad for his parents jesse is a sweet kid but he obviously put them through hell with his drug abuse i think they thought they were doing the right thing showing him tough love and were nt doing it to be jerks or because they were selfish they wanted him to turn his life around but i do wish they had made an effort to support him after rehab he might not have gone back to working with walt if they d been there for him in season 3  but i can get why they d be gun shy about interacting with jesse considering he built a meth lab in his own basement and had run ins with the police they probably saw jesse ping pong between sobriety and drug abuse since he was in high school and had no idea how long he could keep his act together  we got to know jesse a lot in the show and we saw his big heart  so of course we sympathize with him a lot but i can see things from his parents  perspective  too  having an addict as a son would not have been easy ,czqcc3n,breakingbad,television,1454793064,CMelody,4,0,15325,46039,0.0

i m on a third watch of the series so i suppose i m going to notice little things that i had nt before  ok  when gus first meets walt he berated him for not being cautious  and says he is very cautious yet  gus clearly was nt cautious as he did not know walt was related to hank surely a cautious man would have done his research and steered clear ,43v7qy,breakingbad,television,1454433780,Fats33,7,0,44,1965,0.0
what point in the story are you talking about  gus is shown talking about walt to hank early on  right around the time that gus agrees to the initial sale of walt and jesse s meth he goes into the dea s office and sees the jar for donations that hank has set up they talk about walt a little and gus leaves a donation so he knew at least by then  even if not before  then later  when walter and gus talk at the hospital after hank is attacked  walter did nt think gus knew about hank  but gus says he looks into everyone he works with and gus being cautious does nt mean he does nt ever do risky things it just means he spends a lot of time making sure to minimize any negative risks and weighing those risks against the positive outcomes and decides where to go  is taking the cartel head on not a risky venture  especially if you re gon na take out bits of the organization at a time instead of striking at once the cousins  then bolsa  then the head himself what if the cousins had nt died  or bolsa had read the cousins attacks as a betrayal by gus sooner and gotten out of the city  gus is nt above doing things with risk  he s just smart and an excellent strategist  especially with mike as his number two  besides  i m on a rewatch right now  and i m on season 3  and i was wondering if gus all along never wanted to work with walt  but decided to offer him a job in order to get to the cartel because of his association with walter  he is able to influence the next couple of moves the cartel has  ie sending the cousins after hank   whereas without walt  the cousins would have come  killed walt  and left  and gus would still be looking for a good window ,czl8o5h,breakingbad,television,1454437326,DogsBestMan,7,0,63,2891,0.0
i ve said it before here  the one thing that bugs me about gus  character is the fact that he s even entertaining the thought of associating with those two street dealers that walt ran over  i could buy the concerns that you brought up  and remember that gus had no way of knowing that hank was suspended and unarmed when the cousins came after him  but that one bugged me ,czlbkfu,breakingbad,television,1454441285,chief_dirtypants,3,0,1,9767,0.0
i figured gus was the  keep your enemies closer  type  hence he openly befriended lots of police and made himself very visible member of the community maybe the fact that walt was related to a detective made it ironically easier to hide their activities ,czl7d18,breakingbad,television,1454435506,BingeWatchLikeWhoa,1,0,1,17,0.0
another thing that gus was nt cautious about  those 2 drug dealers that walt killed they killed andrea s brother  a child   and the death of a child would obviously bring attention to the police  which could possibly lead back to gus walt was actually doing gus a favor by killing them ,czwysse,breakingbad,television,1455251922,chris2webby,1,0,17,10486,0.0

skyler smoking is definitely not the most disturbing thing in breaking bad i realize you are only in season two so wo nt spoil future events  but melting bodies in acid and having to mop up the remains from season 1 is way more disturbing than smoking  i hate smoking  too but this backlash against smokers is pretty silly my mom and grandmothers all smoked while they were pregnant  way more than a single puff and me and my cousins and aunts and uncles all turned out fine it is nt healthy  but seriously murder and dismemberment is much grosser ,czvk3af,breakingbad,television,1455157648,CMelody,17,0,15325,46039,0.0
your statement that this is the most disturbing thing is not necessarily correct would nt it be more correct to say is it weird that i think this is the most disturbing thing    it s weird that i m going to defend this but while smoking during pregnancy is bad  she s not trying to give herself an abortion or something like most people skyler will encounter dirty air through pollution etc in her 9 months of pregnancy  which is worse than x1 cigarette it s a bad thing to do but she did nt write her baby s death sentence   edit  ok i appreciate that on first viewing  it s ambiguous whether or not this is going to become a regular thing for skyler on first viewing you wonder it it is hinting at worse to come  with disregard to her babies safety like oh is this going to get a lot worse   will she stop looking after herself completely  will she selfharm  what s next   etc ,czvsa54,breakingbad,television,1455174327,LYRAA3,5,0,117,2453,0.0

every time that subject comes up walt mentions  personal reasons  and gretchen during their last civil conversation tells that during his last day with them  he was packing and  barely talking   fast forward to where we are now and elliott and gretchen are married and have a billion dollar company this did nt even occur to me because walt does nt seem like the kind of person to do this but remember that one time we got a flashback to his college years walt and gretchen were calculating the percentage of elements in he human body and he looked so different  lively and in tune with the rest of the world completely different from his behaviour as a chemistry teacher  where he was clearly  burned out   is it possible that walt and gretchen had had an affair in college and later walt found out that gretchen chose elliott  that would explain so much of everything that goes on between them elliott was clearly walt s best friend in college but with gretchen postcollege there was always a kind of tension between the two  it also explains why walt bursts out  and that s your excuse   when gretchen says that walt chose to quit on their company in his mind  gretchen was to blame for him turning his back cuz she turned him down  i do nt know if it s possible or bizarre or even obvious but this show just has so many layers of drama that i do nt always get all of them in one go  i m in the middle of the second binge watch of the series in season 5 episode 6 it s worth every moment ,45eua9,breakingbad,television,1455285723,Shady_maniac,88,0,12768,25110,0.0

i d say not an affair so much as they were together  then she had an affair with elliott  walt s best friend the second thing that happened was that walt was the scientist and elliott was more businessfocused elliott got a hold of the ip for grey matter not sure what order these two took place in  just my  002,czxky2t,breakingbad,television,1455301931,funkensteinberg,7,0,543,2545,0.0
i believe that after walter s pride got in the way of his relationship with gretchen that he felt uncomfortable at grey matters  and since the company was just in startup that he took the buyout so he could pursue teaching  certain that he was destined for college tenure  but that never came to fruition in the meantime gretchen and elliot worked together everyday and that led to their romantic relationship as the company started to flourish  i am on my 35th time watching and i see this the same way every time  yes  i have a life  but it plays at my workstation daily for my distraction while i work i stay productive at work as i quote the lines like i was vince gilligan directing ,czxwxbr,breakingbad,television,1455319924,smoke903,3,0,67,110,0.0

when they were having a party at walt s house walt was giving walt jr a lot of alcohol and he got sore when hank tried to stop him in my opinion  he saw hank telling him experiences he has at his job and felt frustrated because he would never be able to have a relation like that with his own son obviously because his former job was being a chemistry teacher and he couldnt tell him about his other job as a meth cookkingpin am i right or someone knows the reason for it ,4607ne,breakingbad,television,1455588662,dack07,150,0,1,6,0.0

just in addition to what everyone else said  i believe in episode 9 he d just been given the news that his cancer situation had improved somewhat  mentally he d prepared himself for death within weeksmonths  and he was obviously not thrilled about the news for many reasons i think getting drunk at the party was a continuation of that anger  from the doctors  appointment and paper towel dispenser punch up  and another counterintuitive attempt to regain control in his life hank tried to get in the way of that by treating walt like a child in his own house ,d01q3oi,breakingbad,television,1455613186,OhCleo,3,0,191,4504,0.0

my favorite is the fourth i love the tension between walt and gus  and the incredible chemistry between their actors it also has some of my favorite episodes salud  with the takedown of the cartel  including several crowning moments of awesome for jesse and gus also in salud is walt s heartrending breakdown and the beautifully written  directed  and acted scene where he tells walt jr about his own father s illness box cutter  with that incredibly tense scene before and including the murder gus is just perfectly  silently menacing  saying volumes with his body language and facial expressions  in season 4 we also get more information on gus  background  hermanos   a lot of character development for jesse  his trauma after shooting gale  mike s mentorship  andrea and brock   saul losing his shit  skyler growing as a money laundress  and the devastating conclusion at the casa tranquila i love season 3  too but season 3 is less focused in my opinion than 4 is 4 is excellently paced  intense  and characterdriven  plus  gus is my favorite  so i m biased  i think my least favorite may be 1  honestly just because it s the least polished but it s still  damn  good ,czvr1f2,breakingbad,television,1455170830,Amblonyx,9,0,1,5962,0.0

season 5b was just consistently incredible and tense i m always on the edge of my seat watching this one and there s so much that happens the ending of confessions when jesse busts into walt s house will always be one of my favorite scenes season 4 is similarly really good and a close second  but i just like 5b is a little better  least favorite is probably 5a i really like 5a and it has a ton of amazing scenes and episodes and it s extremely necessary for the story  so when i say least favorite i m not saying it s bad at all but at times it does feel really sloppy and rushed i never liked the prison shanking montage in particular  i always thought it did nt work and felt less like breaking bad  and more like the walking dead when it s trying to be significant also  something i noticed on rewatching it is just how much the season focuses on the logistics of planning and starting up an underground meth empire it s pretty fascinating but i think part of the reason it feels so rushed at times is because they spend so much time on that ,czyva74,breakingbad,television,1455400714,higuysimonreddit,1,0,563,1779,0.0

i recently started watching the series for the 3rd time i was a little confused about the dynamics of walt and skyler s relationship at the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2  she gets super pissed after the whole  fugue state  thing and after learning of his second cell phone she starts going  out  to get petty revenge on walt she starts smoking just a lot of bitterness in general then he finds the cigarette pack and confronts her about it after they get chippy with eachother regarding walt jr fight continues  but then starting with  better call saul  and  4 days out   they suddenly seem fine  they are seemingly back to normal  unless i missed something  they never showed an apology or anything like that it coincides with her getting her old job backor is there an implied time gap between some of these episodes  allowing time to mend   i was hoping somebody could let me know if i missed something ,43sfvc,breakingbad,television,1454384779,FLACKYY,6,0,1698,3618,0.0

why would walt admit to his wife and son that he hired neonazis to kill people  if you are talking about the phone call walt made to skyler admitting he murdered hank  he did that because he knew the call was being monitored by the police and he was trying to exonerate skyler from any blame and build a defense that she was coerced by walt to engage in his illegal business affairs  jesse did not cause hank to get killed that is entirely on walt none of it would have happened if he had nt hired jack and todd as his hit squad ,czvdb3b,breakingbad,television,1455146480,CMelody,7,0,15325,46039,0.0
walter had hank killed the moment he succumbed to emotion  and picked up the phone to call jack and that was because his desire to have jesse killed superseded the rationality to see who was with jesse if walter told skyler and jr about the neonazis  it would nt make a difference  he was nt the shooter but he still got hank killed as a result of that erraticallytimed phone call ,czw4hdu,breakingbad,television,1455207428,HowToBeaGoodLeader,2,0,1,887,0.0

are you asking at what point walt could have gone back to life before he approached jesse to start making methamphetamine  i think that s where he started to have accountability at least before that he was just a normal guy  albeit with cancer  the moment of no return though would have to be when he was not allowed to escape or go back without repercussions  i believe that moment to be when walt and jesse made the first deal with tuco  first deal in the junkyard scene   i have multiple reasons   1  from that point  walt had an obligation to show up at the subsequent meeting or tuco was going to track them down due to missing quantity of meth at the subsequent meet  tuco starts to get paranoid about walt and jesse this leads to tuco kidnapping jesse and walt   2  this is when walt s lying no longer consisted of alibis and excuses  but downright inventing medical issues by now having to convince his family he was in a fugue state this led to a overwhelming suspicion in skyler for the remainder of the series   3  it was possible tuco was stalking him at his house walt s identity was compromised as further discussed below  if walt escaped tuco s clutches at tuco s shack  tuco would have hunted him   4  to build off that last note  walt s personal identity and his family s identity were compromised at tuco s shack after looking through his wallet   5  finally  my main and final point the cousins  the only way out of tuco s grasp was to kill him or escape if walt escaped  tuco would have most certainly sent people to find him and tuco definitely knew where to find walt if he returned to his past life  walt instead killed him hector salamanca  as a result  gave walt s identity to the cousins  who proceeded to show up at walt s house with an axe if walt had just given up everything after lying about the fugue state and did nt deny income for treatment from elsewhere  the cousins still would ve shown up at walt s house and gave him the tortuga treatment  on a side note  it was walt s further investment into the meth business that saved him from the cousins the authorities might not have caught him  but he was a dead man after making an obligation to tuco  tl  dr  walt s last chance to escape was before doing his first deal with tuco in the junkyard ,czqdxbd,breakingbad,television,1454795915,olhomy,7,0,3478,9029,0.0

giancarlo esposito gave an interesting answer in  this interview   http  wwwavclubcomarticlegiancarloesposito62959   gt  for me  the uplifting part of breaking bad and what it sheds light on is where we  re at right now in our world  where people would do something so desperate to save their families or provide for me  that  s the essence of gus he has a family yes  they  re in an illicit business  they  re making blue meth  but this is his family and because his moral standards are so high  one of the reasons why he takes out victor in episode 401 is not just to send a message  but because victor made a mistake and he didn  t cover his tracks  and the whole family became at risk  of course as fascinating as this is  we still have to wonder  what was the message  most simply  i think  just  do nt cross me again  or this  in more detail  perhaps   do nt think you can reason or bullshit your way out of crossing me  just because i seem to be a rational businessman i m done listening and i might not be as rational as you think  if you think gus was already planning to replace and kill walt then this message might just be a ruse  hoping to lower walt s guard by letting him think he got off with a warning obviously although gus ca nt kill walt and jesse  he has to respond  somehow   if he failed to respond immediately  then they would most certainly expect the other shoe to drop later  i actually hold to the unpopular opinion that gus  was nt  planning to kill walt at this point this at least seems to be what mike believed  all the way to his dying day  and mike ought to know ,czyl7du,breakingbad,television,1455382893,WheresMyElephant,2,0,11,22918,0.0

i think it s a combination of various reasons 1  gus wanted to prove his dominance to walter and jesse  and that they are never in control of the situation by killing victor  gus shows that they could die at any time if they decided to screw up again it s neat when you consider that this is parallel to what happened in s1 when tuco beat the crap out of his associate for telling walt and jesse to remember who they re working for  2  victor made a bad mistake by taking things into his own hands by making the meth  and going to gale s house  when it was populated by a decent number of people  when he was never authorized to do so basically  he ruined what could ve been a good batch of meth  and left a trace in the crime scene ,czyyqvx,breakingbad,television,1455406846,HowToBeaGoodLeader,1,0,1,887,0.0

better call saul is a lot denser i think it s a great show but it s a little more difficult to get into breaking bad is still pretty slow and dense  but a lot more accessible once everything s all said and done you ca nt rely as much on pure hype alone you know  plus  bcs has tons of callbacks to bb  or i guess technically call forwards   that are really fun to catch ,d01p3i2,breakingbad,television,1455609581,higuysimonreddit,1,0,563,1779,0.0

a couple things i want to say about this first  the episode is called  boxcutters  and the boxcutters themselves link the first scene  where they re used by gail to open the lab equipment and the last scene where they re used by gus to open victor s throat in the first scene gail successfully convinces gus of the importance of the meth quality  saying he ca nt compete with walt and that the difference between 96  and 99  is an  ocean  gus obviously gets the message and in a way this saves walt s life in that scene gus does care about quality now  and victor just ruined an entire batch without being told also he s really pissed that walt just  won   by making himself indispensable when he killed gail gus is pissed off about everything in the situation and he kind of  takes out  his anger on victor while also sending a very clear message to everyone else in the room  walt  jesse  and mike  message to mike  never do anything without asking me ,czys2jx,breakingbad,television,1455394895,Synapse-Decisions,2,0,1,99,0.0
i always saw it this way  he killed him because he started cooking victor claimed he knew how to do it from watching walt do it all the time this pissed gus off he does nt want some rookie potentially fucking up his product ,czybgc4,breakingbad,television,1455353234,Delerium89,2,0,15486,8043,0.0
hank s discovery of the book gale had given walt is ultimately what led to walt getting caught by the dea if walt had not let gus persuade him to get back into the meth business  he never would have met gale  so hank likely never would have found out about walt s involvement in the industry had walt declined gus s offer ,czqebi7,breakingbad,television,1454796643,GopherPA,2,0,20,786,0.0
i think gus made an example out of victor he could nt kill walt or jesse at the time  and so he slit victors throat in front of them it was gus showing them he s not to be crossed despite being their reluctant employer ,czy8svk,breakingbad,television,1455344241,tombonus,14,0,2423,6050,0.0
first post  long time lurker so i was rewatching breaking bad the other day i noticed a scene that caught my attention it is in  bullet points   i do nt know how to use imgur or anything like that unfortunately for the screenshot a more savvy person could help me but it was after the impact of  box cutter   mike is waiting in gus s office to talk about jesse starting to get extremely lazy about the operation while in the back office alone  mike looks as if he is blanking staring and waiting patiently then just as gus walks in the camera focuses on an xacto knife in a cup of pens it s not obvious though  it s upside down in the cup i thought it was just interesting because it showed mike was thinking about it mike was always trusted by gus but i thought the scene showed just for a second that mike was remembering the moment victor died i do nt think he is scared of gus at this point  but he heard him loud and clear afterwards so the xacto knife makes me just think mike was thinking about sharp cutting objects around gus just a small detail i picked up on  just something i saw and wanted to share and get an opinion on i apologize if this has been brought up before too ,45a3cy,breakingbad,television,1455213525,tylerTwoscoops,6,0,1,28,0.0
i noticed that too  i craft  so i recognized the exacto knife immediately i think mike was feeling uneasy about gus right then after all  he did draw his gun on gus when gus sliced victor s throat he was nt expecting it at all i think the knife is an excellent  subtle reflection of mike s thoughts  and also recalls what gus did to victor to the viewer is nt that gus  first appearance after box cutter  too ,czwb464,breakingbad,television,1455216627,Amblonyx,3,0,1,5962,0.0

i ve been rewatching the series for the past couple of days and i m beginning to wonder   what is the latest point in the series walter white could get out of the meth business without being caught  at least by hank and law enforcement    i think that because hank found out via gail s personal belongings as a result of his death  jesse killing gail was ultimately the point of no return for walter  what are your thoughts  rbreakingbad ,44i3vz,breakingbad,television,1454792360,CaikIQ,9,0,3029,2647,0.0
i think it was a scene where they are around the dinner table hank had stopped looking for heisenberg  walt had too much wine and said some things that inspired hank to pick it up again he should not have done that had he not done this  he would have got away with it  and kept the family united  and have money  this is not so much business related  but  walt s perfect moment  to stop and  die  in his own words  in episode fly  would have been before he allowed jane to die he had severe guilt after that that stayed with him forever he could nt achieve true peace in his mind ever again ,czqenxa,breakingbad,television,1454797294,LYRAA3,20,0,117,2453,0.0
are you asking at what point walt could have gone back to life before he approached jesse to start making methamphetamine  i think that s where he started to have accountability at least before that he was just a normal guy  albeit with cancer  the moment of no return though would have to be when he was not allowed to escape or go back without repercussions  i believe that moment to be when walt and jesse made the first deal with tuco  first deal in the junkyard scene   i have multiple reasons   1  from that point  walt had an obligation to show up at the subsequent meeting or tuco was going to track them down due to missing quantity of meth at the subsequent meet  tuco starts to get paranoid about walt and jesse this leads to tuco kidnapping jesse and walt   2  this is when walt s lying no longer consisted of alibis and excuses  but downright inventing medical issues by now having to convince his family he was in a fugue state this led to a overwhelming suspicion in skyler for the remainder of the series   3  it was possible tuco was stalking him at his house walt s identity was compromised as further discussed below  if walt escaped tuco s clutches at tuco s shack  tuco would have hunted him   4  to build off that last note  walt s personal identity and his family s identity were compromised at tuco s shack after looking through his wallet   5  finally  my main and final point the cousins  the only way out of tuco s grasp was to kill him or escape if walt escaped  tuco would have most certainly sent people to find him and tuco definitely knew where to find walt if he returned to his past life  walt instead killed him hector salamanca  as a result  gave walt s identity to the cousins  who proceeded to show up at walt s house with an axe if walt had just given up everything after lying about the fugue state and did nt deny income for treatment from elsewhere  the cousins still would ve shown up at walt s house and gave him the tortuga treatment  on a side note  it was walt s further investment into the meth business that saved him from the cousins the authorities might not have caught him  but he was a dead man after making an obligation to tuco  tl  dr  walt s last chance to escape was before doing his first deal with tuco in the junkyard ,czqdxbd,breakingbad,television,1454795915,olhomy,7,0,3478,9029,0.0

visually this does seem like it s a call back  though i m pretty sure the final walk through memory lane was just that  a nice walk through memory lane reminiscing of the past walt went back there to stop  his  creation from being made and to stop jesse from making it  he did nt care if the quality was amazing  walt was already aware since season 4 that jesse could cook near perfect meth  he just wanted it stopped he then spent his last moments dying with the things that made him feel alive in his final years and he died knowing his creation would die with him ,czvryon,breakingbad,television,1455173355,The_Jean_Genie,5,0,1,4717,0.0

was nt walt and gretchen in a relationship and then something happened between them and elliot  i figured maybe gretchen cheated on walt with elliot and as i have understood it  it was walt   chemistry research  or what to call it  that actually gave ground to the whole success of gray matter ,czu3t97,breakingbad,television,1455062081,quesadillarito,6,0,1,17,0.0

when they were having a party at walt s house walt was giving walt jr a lot of alcohol and he got sore when hank tried to stop him in my opinion  he saw hank telling him experiences he has at his job and felt frustrated because he would never be able to have a relation like that with his own son obviously because his former job was being a chemistry teacher and he couldnt tell him about his other job as a meth cookkingpin am i right or someone knows the reason for it ,4607ne,breakingbad,television,1455588662,dack07,150,0,1,6,0.0

he also feels emasculated by gretchen and elliott getting all of the credit for paying for the treatment that  plus alcohol  plus hank s constant chestpuffing and dick measuring was more than walt could take in that moment ,d01i6wn,breakingbad,television,1455594246,SabineLavine,40,0,834,29475,0.0
there is a parallel power struggle between walt and hank and heisenberg and agent schrader  this is the first time we see a cross between the four of them  agent schrader is getting credit and glory for something heisenberg had to go through and overcome as well  walt wants to be the alpha and role model for this son  but hank is trying to take that role as well  at least in walts eyes anyways ,d01qhmv,breakingbad,television,1455614699,NbKJcK,7,0,5774,8358,0.0
he was tired of getting pushed around by hank hank would brag constantly around anyone who would listen and walt finally got fed up enough to put a stop to it hank was the cool guy in his son s eyes which made him extremely jealous as well because he was disappointed that his son did nt look up to him like that ,d01mrrf,breakingbad,television,1455603041,livinlifeontheedge,6,0,597,6601,0.0
just in addition to what everyone else said  i believe in episode 9 he d just been given the news that his cancer situation had improved somewhat  mentally he d prepared himself for death within weeksmonths  and he was obviously not thrilled about the news for many reasons i think getting drunk at the party was a continuation of that anger  from the doctors  appointment and paper towel dispenser punch up  and another counterintuitive attempt to regain control in his life hank tried to get in the way of that by treating walt like a child in his own house ,d01q3oi,breakingbad,television,1455613186,OhCleo,3,0,191,4504,0.0
i think walt harbors some inner hatred  or at least a very strong dislike  for hank from the moment hank says   i ll take care of your family  after the cancer diagnosis so any time hank insinuates in any way that he has more power than walt  walt gets more pissed off ,d024uv3,breakingbad,television,1455646001,highonautism,3,0,1,47,0.0

why did gustavo kill victor  the only thing i can think of is at the end of the episode when the police were taking pictures  there was a folder titled  lab notes   victor did nt do any clean up or pick that up  and the fact that the neighbors saw him  gus s fingerprints are all over the apartment he had no choice to get rid of loose ends ,45iv9m,breakingbad,television,1455340261,MrCockroach,53,0,174,186,0.0
i actually just rewatched this episode and wondered the same thing i think it s twofold  1  victor was seen and is a liability  and 2  gus wanted to make a statement to walt and jesse that they should never feel safe ,czy9hj6,breakingbad,television,1455346253,heartwell,38,0,1900,1439,0.0
 i  ve been thinking about victor all this time  i was sure that gus did what he did to send me a message maybe there  s another reason victor trying to cook that batch on his own  taking liberties that weren  t his to takemaybe he flew too close to the sun  got his throat cut  walt to jesse  end of s05e03 i m pretty certain the implication was ultimately that it was nt an instance of gus threatening walt and jesse by sending a  do nt fuck with me  message  but rather a display of powersomething that walt only realizes once he s able to understand this feeling himself  power struggle between walt and mike in their new business venture  with mike taking out large percentages of their earnings to pay off the madrigal guys in prison  against walt s wishes and without his consent   in my opinion this is why he killed mike gusvictor happened again with waltmike there was no logical reason for either of their murders  and they were both fueled purely by anger at the other person for not respecting authority ,czyd6br,breakingbad,television,1455360845,TMA-3,22,0,10712,52397,0.0
