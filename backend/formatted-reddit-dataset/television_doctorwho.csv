i  m using a classic who rewatch  dw on youtube and lots of big finish to see me through the drought and i  m going to some local dw cons since others have talked about bf i  ll talk about youtube and dw cons  youtube has a lot of dw trailers  short clips  minisodes  parodies  webisodes and fan films the quality and style varies but many are quite good sometimes the production values aren  t the best  but the plot or acting makes up for it older productions are closer to the classic style and are often lacking in sets and special effects later ones are closer to new who in style and use contemporary filming and production techniques and values search out your favorites and build a watch list  dw conventions are another thing to try there are likely to be some within a reasonable travel distance medium size ones like awesome con and wizard world feature multiple sci fi shows with some dw actors and panels they usually are held in convention centers in multiple cities smaller ones like long island who and  re  generations focus on dw actors and panels they offer a more up close and personal experience they are often held in a single city at a large hotel venue both size cons are a lot of fun and while not always cheap  unless they are close by   what you spend on a con and what you get back for it could be compared to a buying binge on big finish  there is also that other time travel show on the scyfy channel  12 monkeys it  s much better than the movie but does require keeping up with the story if interested  i recommend watching season 1 before season 2 starts up in april to get a better understanding of what is going on and there is also the librarians  which  while not really time travel  is loosely styled after dw and there are rick and morty reruns  as they are not doing a 2016 season either  edit  forgot to add legends of tomorrow as another time travel viewing option ,d00pb2y,doctorwho,television,1455550344,Starlifter141,1,0,12,886,0.0

sontaren strategem i m fine withother than the really annoying kid  but then i think that was the point of his character  the end of time just made me dislike the 10th doctor  that s why i dislike it he was full of life and energy but went out depressed it was also a bloody awful way of transitioning to 11  it felt like you were meant to hate 11 for taking over  which is just a terrible way of introducing a new doctor and it spent way too long on the legacy  of rtd  9 and 11 had much better regenerations in comparison they went out positively and 11 s regeneration did nt hang too long on the past they showed amy for a couple seconds  he made a speech about change being good whilst still showing appreciation for what he d done and he was gone it was a great way of saying goodbye to 11 and his legacy whilst introducing 12  i could have done away with clara s i miss 11  plot point  since she probably understood regeneration the most out of all the modern companions and it felt shoehorned in  but i suppose it was to help the fans who only liked 1011 for their youthlooks  if steven and capaldi both leave at the end of series 10  then i suppose we ll see how he handles giving a legacy  goodbye compared to rtd ,d01swuw,doctorwho,television,1455624428,jarkortheburninator,2,0,1,184,0.0

ca nt help with cardiff  but i m going in may  and these are all great questions  to add another question  is eddie s diner any good  i thought it would be a fun spot to eat after visiting the doctor who experience  since it was used in the show  as for bath  we visited last time we went  and it s a beautiful city i recommend seeing the roman baths  pricey  but worth it   it s one of the few cities we ll be revisiting on this trip ,czy0pde,doctorwho,television,1455326698,elderflowermouse,2,0,9,26,0.0

moffat s a different friggin  person from rtd so he has a different writing style  amy and rory got married  so they were less dependent on their parents amy s did nt even exist till the universe was rebooted and we did see brian a few times river is also family  technically  clara was also more independent from her family  having an actual job teaching she did lose her mum when she was 16  probably making her more independent as a person we then see her family at christmas  gt  i have noticed that the companions in the rtd era often stay with their families after the doctor leaves them  rose stays with her mum and dad  martha marries mickey but could visit her mum anytime  and donna is with wilfred  rose and martha were really young  early 20s amy  rory  and clara were late 20s to 30s  gt  however with moffat all of the recent companions seem to have abandoned their families without any conclusion or goodbye  making me wonder if the families even know what happened to them  or just think they died or something oh  oh     oh     you have nt seen ps  it is your lucky day my friend   the cut and never filmed scene to angels take manhattan  ps   https  youtubexwu6xl9xi4k  note  written by chris chibnall  brian knew about the doctor and time travel fully  but the pond parents probably were nt briefed on it even when the doctor showed up to their wedding she probably said it was all a magic trick with smoke and mirrors  since clara just left  we of course have nt had time to see the aftermath of her dying the recent deaths of mr pink and ms oswald will likely be a direct catalyst in the spinoff class ,d02lv81,doctorwho,television,1455669820,LegoK9,6,0,594,12954,0.0

the halloween of the past two years  i  ve had had the privilege of attending the inception of a small fantasy convention   conjuration   http  wwwconjurationconcom   which created and run by a family friend  fun fact  if you search hard enough  you can find my handsome mug on the website and no  i am not the freckled child on the homepage   last year  easily the most interesting and insightful panel was  doctor who  sorting hat   where a room of people worked together to sort characters from doctor who into the houses of hogwarts from this really obscure book and movie franchise called harry potter i should  ve written this down then  but i do believe i remembered what the room decided  and added a few characters we didn  t get to  for those who don  t know  or possible for those who do  here  s a quick review of what the hogwarts houses stand for  what the houses   aren  t     gryffindor  the good guy house  slytherin  the evil snake house  ravenclaw  the nerd house  hufflepuff  the loser house what the houses   are     gryffindor  bravery  slytherin  ambition  ravenclaw  knowledge  hufflepuff  loyalty   classic doctors    the classic doctors were hard to categorize  especially 13 i  ve seen very little of the classic series  so if you could give me some better quotes showing their house  i would appreciate it    one  ravenclaw doctor  have you ever thought what it s like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension  have you  to be exiles  very by the book  doctor  but you ca nt rewrite history  not one line  oh  how times have changed   pun fucking intended   high fives self    two  gryffindor doctor  there are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things things which act against everything we believe in they must be fought   three  ravenclaw he  s always doing some kind of experiment while he  s stuck on earth  doctor  i reversed the polarity of the neutron flow  doctor  courage is nt just a matter of not being frightened  you know it s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway   four  gryffindor doctor  well  the final responsibility is mine and mine alone you see  if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives could you then kill that child  do i have the right  simply touch one wire against the other  and it s it  the daleks cease to exist  hundreds of millions of people  thousands of generations  can live without fear  in peace  and never even know the word  dalek   but if i kill  wipe out a whole intelligent life form  then i d become like them i d be no better than the daleks  bravery sometimes requires mercy always mercy   five  hufflepuff i have seen the caves of androzani  so five sacrificing himself just to save peri along with his loyalty to his other companions is a hufflepuff in my book  doctor  for some people  small  beautiful events are what life is all about   six  slytherin never seen a episode of his  but i have seen the infamous choking scene    _    _   doctor  a little gratitude would nt irretrievably damage my ego  doctor  small though it is  the human brain can be quite effective when working at full efficiency  not unlike myself   seven  ravenclaw doctor  every great decision creates ripples  like a huge boulder dropped in a lake the ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforeseeable ways the heavier the decision  the larger the waves  the more uncertain the consequences  and is very cold and calculating at times  doctor  i knew i knew she carried the evil inside her do you think i d have chosen a social misfit if i had nt known  she could nt even pass her chemistry exams at school  and yet she manages to create a time storm in her bedroom i saw your hand in it from the very beginning she s an emotional cripple i would nt waste my time on her  unless i had to use her somehow  ace  leave me alone  doctor  i d have done anything not to hurt you  but i had to save you from fenric s evil curse your faith in me was holding the haemovore back    wilderness doctors     cause why not    eight  gryffindor doctor  will it hurt  ohila  yes  doctor  good    revival doctors    war  hufflepuff what started out as someone saying   well he certainly isn  t hufflepuff  got everyone in the room going   well actually  how loyal do you have to be to fight for the planet and the people that you spent most of your life running from  war  what i did  i did without choice in the name of peace and sanity  war  no great men are forged in fire it is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame  whatever the cost   nine  gryffindor gryffindor  gryffindor basically the consensus of the whole room  doctor  no  cos this is what i m gon na do  i m gon na rescue her  i m gon na save rose tyler from the middle of the dalek fleet  and then i m gon na save the earth  and then  just to finish off  i m gon na wipe every last stinking dalek out of the sky  dalek  but you have no weapons  no defenses  no plan  doctor  yeah and does nt that scare you to death  is this a conversation between a dalek and the doctor or hermione and harry   ten  slytherin oh yes  you heard me right mr spaceman prettyboy sandshoes himself is in the evil snake house  absurd  you say  but look over it  doctor  for a long time now  i thought i was just a survivor  but i m not i m the winner that s who i am the time lord victorious  doctor  i could do so much more so much more  and the old favorite  doctor  i do nt want to go  even eleven comments on his past face  doctor  well  number ten once regenerated and kept the same face i had vanity issues at the time   eleven  hufflepuff amy  all the friends you make just flicker in and out you must hardly notice us  the doctor  amy  you are enormous parts of my life and you are all i ever remember  eleven has his own brand of loyalty  and it is an undying one he rewrote kazran sardick life  arguably for the better  to save the lives of amy and rory  along with 4001 other people  doctor  those words run away i want you to be famous for those exact words i want people to call you colonel run away i want children laughing outside your door  because they ve found the house of colonel run away   and  when people come to you  and ask if trying to get to me through the people i love is in any way a good idea    i want you to tell them your name oh  look  i m angry that s new i m really not sure what s going to happen now  doctor  but they coming back  do nt you see  every time i negotiate  i try to understand well  not today no today  i honour the victims first his  the master s  the daleks   all the people who died because of my mercy   twelve  slytherin clara  okay  so what sort of person would put a cryptic note in  in a newspaper advert  doctor  well  i would say that that person would be an egomaniac  needy  gameplayer sort of person  the doctor was describing clara  but clara thought he was describing himself they  re perfect for each other  clara  so you were pretending to be heartless  doctor  would you like to think that about me  would that make it easier  i did nt know if i could save her i could nt save quell  i could nt save moorhouse there was a good chance that she d die too at which point  i would have just moved onto the next  and the next  until i beat it sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones but you still have to choose  doctor  i m the doctor  and i save people and if anyone happens to be listening  and you ve got any kind of a problem with that  to hell with you  doctor  i was lost a long time ago she was saving you i ll do my best  but i strongly advise you to keep out of my way you ll find that it s a very small universe when i m angry with you  the ambition it takes to spend 45 billion years punching through super diamond to save your friend  doctor  i had a duty of care   tally  g      s     r     h       this tally is important because the people in the room  without even trying  made the doctor basically the most balanced fictional character in all of history i not 100  sure i got the doctors sorted right  but i did remember the tally  and worked backwards from there    revival companions    rose  gryffindor rose  no  i did nt mean that but it was  it was a better life i don  t mean all the travelling and seeing aliens and spaceships and things that do nt matter the doctor showed me a better way of living your life you know  he showed you too you do nt just give up you don  t just let things happen you make a stand you say  no  you have the guts to do what s right when everyone else just runs away  and i just ca nt   mickey  hufflepuff mickey  and i waited for you  rose twelve months  waiting for you and the doctor to come back  mickey  me  i m their man in havana i m the technical support i m oh  my god i m the tin dog   captain jack  gryffindor he  ll die for anyone  jack  roseyou are worth fighting for wish i d never met you  doctor i was much better off as a coward see you in hell   martha  ravenclaw duh  martha  oh  do you think  bones of

gt  slytherin is not the evil bad guy house gt  six is slytherin because he choked peri when suffering severe regeneration trauma right i agree with all your doctor ratings up til five  but six is so clearly gryffindor it makes my head spin he s all about straightforward bravery  righteous fury and half a dozen other gryffindor traits i agree with uwtfbbc that seven is totally slytherin the intellect you cite as a ravenclaw trait was primarily in abundance in service to his cunning  ambitious schemes  i think eight could go either gryffindor or hufflepuff  but i m more inclined to put him with the puffs  personally i think he d prefer it there  i think war is totally gryffindor he was nt fighting for the people he d run from for centuries  he was fighting for everyone who was nt involved i see his involvement less as loyalty to the time lords and more as a  philosopher s stone  neville longbottom moment against them  no debates on nine and eleven  though i d note that eleven has a very slytherin streak  ten and twelve are hard though i get the feeling you put ten in slytherin because he s selfish  but i do nt think that s overtly a slytherin trait then again  one of the first things he did was depose the ruler of a country he s certainly cunning  but he s only ambitious in terms of desiring his own survival to an uncommon extent compared to his other selves he does nt really make plans and enact them like seven does  i think seven and ten are sort of inverse to each other  really i d love a twodoctor story starring them come on  big finish   i suppose i can comfortably write him down as slythindor  with the emphasis on slytherin twelve though  i really do nt know where to put him i feel like what he values most does nt really fit on the couragecunningloyaltyknowledge spectrum or that he does nt always seem to embody his own traits for example  he does nt act like he cares in times of extreme stress  but he always acts callous out of compassion and his line in  dark water    do you think i care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference    is just about the most hufflepuff thing i ve ever heard i d tentatively put him with the puffs but he s got a strong gryffindor streak in the less selfassured  godic gryffindor  sense that i think is hard to discount  ah well  i agree on everything you said about the companions except that i would nt classify  doctordonna   a collection of doctorbrainwaves superimposed on donna s mind  as enough of a character to be sorted  and that i could nt even consider donna as slytherin her kind of selfishness ca nt accurately be described as  ambition   that  and this line  gt  amy barely deserves  rory   barely  noo  she does nt just her good fortune he happens to love her  because he could do  so  much better if he wanted to  anyway  as for the classics  the companion i m most sure of is ace i can hardly think of a more gryffindor woman  edit  oh  and thanks for finally posting this it was a blast reading and thinking about  who helped you make your tally  out of curiosity ,d01l4rn,doctorwho,television,1455599461,Adekis,4,0,304,7975,0.0

if you re really into the show and the characters and the stories they have to tell  lower production should nt affect anything i can understand why you think it would  but most of the time you do nt even notice if you let yourself get immersed in the story some of the best nuwho episodes are definitely scattered through seasons 14  and i think they re worth watching it also gives you more appreciation for the growth of the show into season 5 if you re simply watching it for entertainment  i guess you could start at season 5 and be fine but if you really want to understand the characters  especially the doctor  and allow yourself to become immersed in the show  i would stay start from season 1 ,czxri14,doctorwho,television,1455311280,ManWhoNeverWould,1,0,1,100,0.0

 we are all stories in the end just make it a good one   we all change  when you think about it we re all different people all through our lives  and that s okay  that s good  you ve got to keep moving  so long as you remember all the people that you used to be i will not forget one line of this  not one day  i swear i will always remember when the doctor was me   you could replace  the doctor  with  the high school student  or  the undergraduate  depending on what you re graduating from    do nt give up not ever not for one single day be safe  if you can be but always be amazing   what s the point of being grown up if you ca nt be childish sometimes   as we learn about each other  so we learn about ourselves   just one question  do you happen to know how to fly this thing    funny because nobody knows how to manage their lives when they re about to graduate and go onto a new thing haha  basically like every time the doctor regenerates    when you re a kid  they tell you it s all grow up  get a job  get married  get a house  have a kid and that s it but the truth is  the world is so much stranger than that it s so much darker and so much madder and so much better   every life is a pile of good things and bad things the good things do nt always soften the bad things but vice versa  the bad things do nt necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant   before i go  i just want to tell you  you were fantastic absolutely fantastic and you know what  so was i  if you want something short and sweet  you could always opt for  allonsy   or  geronimo   congrats on graduating soon  cheers amp  good luck ,d017uzz,doctorwho,television,1455577843,ManWhoNeverWould,7,0,1,100,0.0

the clothes which the characters wear are more the costume designer s decision with the actors also getting a say  karen gillan has mentioned that the reason why amy wore short skirts was because she wanted her to wear them  jenna coleman has also mentioned that she had some input in what clara wore she said that she wanted her to look like a woman in her 20s from london who is with the fashion but is nt trying too hard  i think there are also some other out of universe reasons for the characters clothes for example in universe it seems impractical for clara to wear high heels but out of universe jenna had to wear them more often than not because they would nt manage to fit her into a shot with mattpeter  it s not like she never wore trousers  since you mention face the raven  you might as well mention heaven senthell bent i m pretty sure she also wore trousers in the girl who died as well as flatline for example  protokun7 has already mentioned all the episodes in which amy wore trousers  there have also been several for river  though for some of them  she also wore a dress as well   silence in the libraryforest of the dead time of angelsflesh and stone the pandorica opensthe big bang the impossible astronautday of the moon wedding of river song  well in the last scene  so all in all  it s actually only clara who is wearing skirtsdresses most of the time but it s not like young women who wear skirtdresses most of the time do nt exist it s been a few years since i was in school but for many of my female teachers it was pretty common to dress in a similar fashion as clara did  though not anywhere nearly as trendy as her  ,czx9jot,doctorwho,television,1455284530,SilenceFall,3,0,1,2194,0.0

i m 37  and i remember doctor who airing on pbs late saturday evenings when i was a child growing up in the late 70s  and early 80s my first recollection of doctor who was when tom baker was the doctor i also remember k9 and was enamored by the little tin dog  for whatever reason i quit watching the show not too long after the 4th doctor regenerated for the fifth time who knows why  who knows   get it   anyway  fast forward over 30 years later  and i find myself surrounded by  whovians  i had never heard the term before  but just about everyone i know enjoyed watching the new doctor who series that we ve all come to love i was peerpressured into watching doctor who again  and i reluctantly gave in the 50th anniversary special was upon us  and i decided to give the show a go even though i had no knowledge of what was going on then  the scene at the end where the doctor meets the  great curator   and tom baker appears in all of his magnificence  and suddenly the tears come streaming down my face  there he was  my doctor  i had chills down my spine because it was the doctor i knew in that moment  i made the decision to become a rabid fan i started with season one of the new doctor who series  and i fell in love with doctor who all over again i m glad i did not research the show prior to watching any of the episodes because every show was a surprise to me i was sad when the 9th doctor regenerated into the 10th  and so on  to this day  i have immersed myself in doctor who i love this fandom  and i love talking about doctor who with other fans thank the time lords for this amazing reddit forum  and all of you other whovians ,461ydc,doctorwho,television,1455619768,PostcardPoet,19,0,1,83,0.0

so i ve just started watching the classic series  from the beginning i am only at the daleks episode and it s really boring me  unlike any of the nuwho episodes so my question is  does it change at any time with the classic series  do the episodes get shorter and more like the newer ones or is it all divided into up to 7  who thought it s a good idea  part miniserials ,45y4bc,doctorwho,television,1455563711,Vergilus123,2,0,1,70,0.0
if you are new to classic who it can take a while to get used to them classic who production values are very different from those of new who and can be an acquired taste i grew up watching the classics but in the black and white years aren  t my favorite ones  even so you can find great and good stories among the less good ones for each doctor you may want to start with the best episodes of each classic doctor you can search for posts on the subject  probably more of them in rgallifrey  or look in the faq here for the section on best of the classic who episodes  edit  text correction,d012356,doctorwho,television,1455569252,Starlifter141,1,0,12,886,0.0
i really dislike  the daleks   myself i watched it early and it gave me a very bad impression of hartnell that took years to get over  i ll echo the others  advice to stop going in order and switch to another doctor maybe try to find a story that features a villain you enjoy  watch  genesis of the daleks  for daleks or  the sea devils  for the master or you can figure out what style of story you like  alien invasion  historical setting  and try to find a classic story that s structured in the same way that way  you ve got a bit of an anchor back to the familiarthis is the kind of modern doctor who you enjoy  so classic will feel less foreign to you if the villain or plot structure is similar ,d019rcy,doctorwho,television,1455580870,janisthorn2,1,0,65,5455,1.0
it stays as multipart miniserials  but they differ in length and quality for instance the next story   the edge of destruction   is only two parts which is roughly the length of one new who episode since they re 20 minutes to the current 40 i got burned out trying to marathon it too  most people suggest skipping ahead to the good episodes or sampling a story or two from each doctor to see how you like them ,d00ylq0,doctorwho,television,1455564237,ChronaMewX,1,0,1268,38997,0.0
gt  i am only at the daleks episode and it s really boring me  unlike any of the nuwho episodes  not surprising i ve only seen a few of the classics  but they just do nt have the modern nuwho quality they re fun to watch in retrospect to see the cheesiness and see how far the show has come and changed in 50 years you do nt have to watch them if they are nt interesting you can skip around to other doctors if you want  gt  so my question is  does it change at any time with the classic series  do the episodes get shorter and more like the newer ones or is it all divided into up to 7 part miniserials  save for the five doctors and mission to the unknown  they re all multipart serials ranging from 2 to 14 parts  around 25 minutes each  gt   who thought it s a good idea  serialized tv was very common in the 60s it really only continued for doctor who into the 80s out of tradition and saving money on sets and props ,d00ywyz,doctorwho,television,1455564681,LegoK9,0,0,594,12954,0.0
if you re expecting the kind of spectacle the new series is known foryou ll be disappointed classic who was from an era when they were transitioning from long  detailed radio drama s to modern television so you get slower  more detailed  stories spread over more episodes  that said  the first two doctors are quite unlike the rest hartnell most of all the reason being is because the show was originally conceived with ian as the main character  the strong  heroic male lead  and the doctor as the plot device he does develop a fair bit though and troughton is when you see him taking on much of his noticeable attributes  my advice  start with tom baker s first season he s probably the easiest for nuwho fans to connect with and the season is awesome  sarah jane is my all time favorite companion  genesis of the daleks introduces a major character and is generally considered one of the best classic serials  and ark in space is well loved too   if you like him keep going you ll get acclimated to the style and might have an easier time with the old episodes ,d015vlv,doctorwho,television,1455574814,LordDaccat,0,0,17,6561,0.0

so netflix no longer has doctor who i started buying them on amazon and episode 1 of the new series the doctor is talking about how he can feel the turn of the earth he then says it is going 1000 miles per hour  would nt it be strange for him to say mph  does nt the rest of the world use the metric system ,461ato,doctorwho,television,1455605457,alterego890,1,0,41,264,0.0
no road signs in the uk are in miles and they commonly and quite frequently use miles when they talk about speed and distance they only really use the metric system elsewhere roads were supposed to switch to metric but they have nt really done so they still use miles though car speedometers have both mph and kmh  also there are no plans to metricate the road signage in the uk either  ireland inherited the imperial system from the uk even after our independence  we still used it it was nt until 2005 because of our membership in the eu that we fully switched to metric but that s mostly only road signage people in my generation  20s  and older tend to still use miles when we re talking speeddistance ,d01nuiz,doctorwho,television,1455605790,AWildDorkAppeared,9,0,1,7067,0.0

imho this would be a generally enjoyable  but not outstanding  episode if it were not for the two sorethumb issues  namely that arrow  and that it started capaldi rather than smith  yes  the antibanter scenes worked with capaldi  and would have to have been replaced with something very different for smith  but everything else about this tale screamed smith and left the story feeling an isolated oddity in midst of some great early capaldi material ,d00njuz,doctorwho,television,1455547074,GreyShuck,8,0,2822,14226,0.0

look  i love 12 he s my favourite doctor  but people are just assuming he s being pushed out he most likely is not and in fairness  capaldi prepared us for this months ago he said series 10 could be his last  that despite him previously saying he d do it forever if he could  it s hard and can be very tiring  if capaldi is indeed leaving  it will be of his own choice  not because he was pushed out bbc already made that mistake with colin baker and 12 is arguably the most popular and well received doctor since tennant was around i personally preferred smith over tennant  but that aside  capaldi is extremely popular bbc are nt dumb  and they re not going to push him out because if they did that  there would be a fan outrageoutburst and they d be levelled with complaints in the hundreds of thousands  if not millions  if capaldi is leaving  which is unconfirmed   then it ll be his choice  and also the bookies thing does nt mean anything did nt they do the same thing when people thought david tennant was regenerating in the stolen earth  it s the same situation here  only they re taking advantage of the fact that there s a year of no doctor who and coupling it with fan panic about capaldi staying on or leaving and they re doing this  which in turn is causing people more panic  people  simple fact is  as great as 12 is  if capaldi is leaving  it s   his   choice ,d01k3bu,doctorwho,television,1455597448,AWildDorkAppeared,1,0,1,7067,0.0

1  at trenzalore  the great intelligence jumps into the doctor s time stream and starts messing his life up in order to undo all the damage  clara also jumps into the doctor s time stream and gets scattered through his life  so she supposedly has seen every regeneration of the doctor and saved him in little ways throughout his life eleven goes in and saves her  which gives us the clara we now know  2  basically  the cracks in space and time were erasing events from time  and the doctor said the only way to close such a crack was for it to consume a complicated spacetime event he reached into the crack at one point and pulled out a piece of the tardis  so then he realized what he needed to do was fly the tardis into it and let it consume him he was able to come back because amy and rory remembered him and their adventures with him there was one residual crack  however  which you see when eleven is defending christmas the time lords found it and were trying to come through but eleven would nt let them because he knew it would restart the time war but clara ended up convincing the time lords to give the doctor a new regeneration cycle using that crack before they closed it  3  bad wolf was a message rose sent to herself from the future she used the power from staring into the heart of the tardis to scatter the words bad wolf  taken from bad wolf corporations  the name of the company that took over satellite 5  which was actually run by the daleks  randomly throughout her time stream it was a message to herself to go back to save the nine  basically  after he sent her home  hope this helps  if you have anymore questions let us know ,d01gfwn,doctorwho,television,1455591469,ManWhoNeverWould,2,0,1,100,0.0
1  the great intelligence enters the doctor s time stream  splitting himself across all of the doctor s lives throughout all of time  trying to rewrite his every victory into failure clara enters the time stream to try to prevent that and she too is split across all of the doctor s lives  only she is born and grows up in multiple lives  each time helping andor saving the doctor in some way  even little ways  2  the cracks in space and time were caused by the tardis exploding when the universe ends  everything is slowly dying the pandorica contains a cell from every living thing in the universe and therefore can be used to  reboot  the universe  essentially reverse the effects of it ending  if only it can be spread simultaneously across all of time the only way to do that is to fly it into the exploding tardis the doctor does this  time reverses and the cracks close  with only the doctor and river remembering because they re time lords  and amy and rory remember because amy has that ability because she grew up next to the time crack  and her bond with rory allowed her to save his memories too  however  not all cracks closed as the loop was not yet finished once back on trenzalore  the doctor discovered a crack and with help from handles the cyberman head and the seal of rassilon  is able to decode a message coming through the crack and realises that it s the time lords on the other side the want the doctor to speak his real name so they ll know it s safe to emerge back into the proper universe unforetunately  he refuses to do so they keep trying but he wo nt do it clara however  convinces them to give him some new regenerations and they then close the final crack themselves  opting to emerge back into the universe but position themselves near the very end of it billions and billions of years in the future so that they re safe  you learn this in series 9  3  the bad wolf is rose absorbing the heart of the tardis into herself she is essentially like idris  but instead she s in rose s body she then reveals that the bad wolf message they kept encountering was something she herself did  and then she proceeds to do it  taking the words and scattering them throughout time so that 9 and rose will always end up there in those moments  to ensure bad wolf is born a perfect loop ,d01jn01,doctorwho,television,1455596650,AWildDorkAppeared,1,0,1,7067,0.0

1  iirc  clara tossed herself into the doctor s timestream to save him from getting killed at trenzalore this scattered her throughout his life  over and over again and again  2  iirc  turns out that was gallifrey trying to peak out from the timepocket he stuck it in at the climax of the time war  and again later   and wound up getting closed up again after they gave him another set of regenerations  and set him on the path of eventually finding a way to free them or something i kinda forget that part  3  that was rose  when she gazed into the eye of eternity and took on a chunk of the power that fuels the tardis  sending both herself and the doctor a message scattered randomly back in time  to lead them to the point where she could gaze into the eye of eternity and take on a chunk of the power that fuels the tardis iow  she made it a selffulfilling prophecy so that she could have the power to dropkick the dalek fleet ,d01fn66,doctorwho,television,1455590210,RichardMHP,2,0,3562,18064,0.0

the dr who expanded universe is probably the biggest out of any tv or film series  firstly  if you have nt watched the classic series  i highly recommend it there are plenty of threads saying what to watch  and also rgallifreylive watching all the episodes in chronological order  next  there s the spinoffs the main two are torchwood and the sarah jane adventures basically  torchwood is for adults with sex and violence  and sja is for kids they re both very good  but in different ways there is also k9  which was awful  and k9 and company  which had 1 episode and was doctor who s first spinoff attempt we re also getting a new spinoff in 2016  called class class is written by patrick ness and will be aimed at a  young adult audience   that s pretty much all we know about it rclasstv thirdly  big finish productions make loads of audio stories for doctor who  as well as several of their own spinoffs such as bernice summerfield and jago and litefoot most of their stuff is based on classic who  but they have recently got a licence to make stuff with new who characters and torchwood their best range is probably their 8th doctor range  there are also loads of books for both classic and new who doctors  and titan comics have content for the 8th  war  9th  10th  11th and 12th doctors  that s most of the eu  but almost every month i seem to find out about some other obscure eu series like  kaldor city   https  enwikipediaorgwikikaldor_city  ,czzocnv,doctorwho,television,1455468980,Koquillon,7,0,537,4673,0.0
ok  so i voted for eleventh hour  once   it was nt an easy choice and i spent some time deliberating on it i love heaven sent  capaldi is great and the script and direction are brilliant but the eleventh hour holds a very special place for me  unlike a many here by the end of rtd s run i was a bit jaded  other than the waters of mars i was pretty disappointed with the specials  but i knew there were big changes coming that first trailer for series 5 that came straight after the end of time got me so hyped and four months later when eleventh hour came on i was not disappointed  it was a breath of fresh air  new doctor  new show runner and new production team all working their agame i thinkiits actually the best introduction to a new doctor and introduction to a new companion smith became the doctor as soon as he climbed out of the tardis in amelia s garden to me he took faster to the role than any of the doctors in nuwho by the end of the episode you know who matt s doctor is it just works perfectly as an introduction to the new era  however it is only due to the nature of the brackets in this tournament that i end up putting this episode at the top if i were to list my favourite episodes it would probably end up in the top 10 but not even close to first ,czyf0zm,doctorwho,television,1455368859,loonongrass,2,0,76,4180,0.0

the experience itself is around 25 minutes  afterwards you can visit the exhibition  which will take 30 minutes if you re quick and up to 90 if you take your time  do the photo booth etc and then there s the shop of course  i do nt know much about cardiff because the two times i went to the experience  i did it as a daytrip from london but i can tell you it has a starbucks ,czy1lqt,doctorwho,television,1455328384,WikipediaKnows,2,0,13484,30698,1.0

you are adding a doctor in there somewhere  or counting the first doctor as a spent regen there were seven doctors in the original run  one doctor in a movie special  the war doctor  then 4 total in the new who 3 before capaldi  that makes the since the first doctor is not counted towards cycles  there were 11 regens once you factor in 10s use of he hand to partially regen  that s number twelve then he gets his reset from the rift allowing for his 13th new face  or 14th regeneration ,czyzwsm,doctorwho,television,1455408902,Pagrashtak,2,0,2379,18753,0.0

if you re new to classics  do nt try watching from the start in order the black and white era can be a killer to get through if you only know the new stuff  and the long serials were never designed to be watched all the way through in one sitting  i d recommend jumping around to some of the well regarded stories of different doctors and styles  to sample what s on offer and seeing what you like  rather than trying to marathon a show that was never made to be marathoned  i d personally recommend  third doctor  spearhead from space  carnival of monsters fourth doctor  the ark in space  the seeds of doom  city of death fifth doctor  kinda  the caves of androzani seventh doctor  remembrance of the daleks give these a go  and if any of the eras interests you  jump around  see what else is well regarded or interesting  and give that a go if watching longer serials bores you  try splitting a story over two days,d01168s,doctorwho,television,1455567955,TheRabbitTest,5,0,573,2018,0.0

the dr who expanded universe is probably the biggest out of any tv or film series  firstly  if you have nt watched the classic series  i highly recommend it there are plenty of threads saying what to watch  and also rgallifreylive watching all the episodes in chronological order  next  there s the spinoffs the main two are torchwood and the sarah jane adventures basically  torchwood is for adults with sex and violence  and sja is for kids they re both very good  but in different ways there is also k9  which was awful  and k9 and company  which had 1 episode and was doctor who s first spinoff attempt we re also getting a new spinoff in 2016  called class class is written by patrick ness and will be aimed at a  young adult audience   that s pretty much all we know about it rclasstv thirdly  big finish productions make loads of audio stories for doctor who  as well as several of their own spinoffs such as bernice summerfield and jago and litefoot most of their stuff is based on classic who  but they have recently got a licence to make stuff with new who characters and torchwood their best range is probably their 8th doctor range  there are also loads of books for both classic and new who doctors  and titan comics have content for the 8th  war  9th  10th  11th and 12th doctors  that s most of the eu  but almost every month i seem to find out about some other obscure eu series like  kaldor city   https  enwikipediaorgwikikaldor_city  ,czzocnv,doctorwho,television,1455468980,Koquillon,7,0,537,4673,0.0

i  m using a classic who rewatch  dw on youtube and lots of big finish to see me through the drought and i  m going to some local dw cons since others have talked about bf i  ll talk about youtube and dw cons  youtube has a lot of dw trailers  short clips  minisodes  parodies  webisodes and fan films the quality and style varies but many are quite good sometimes the production values aren  t the best  but the plot or acting makes up for it older productions are closer to the classic style and are often lacking in sets and special effects later ones are closer to new who in style and use contemporary filming and production techniques and values search out your favorites and build a watch list  dw conventions are another thing to try there are likely to be some within a reasonable travel distance medium size ones like awesome con and wizard world feature multiple sci fi shows with some dw actors and panels they usually are held in convention centers in multiple cities smaller ones like long island who and  re  generations focus on dw actors and panels they offer a more up close and personal experience they are often held in a single city at a large hotel venue both size cons are a lot of fun and while not always cheap  unless they are close by   what you spend on a con and what you get back for it could be compared to a buying binge on big finish  there is also that other time travel show on the scyfy channel  12 monkeys it  s much better than the movie but does require keeping up with the story if interested  i recommend watching season 1 before season 2 starts up in april to get a better understanding of what is going on and there is also the librarians  which  while not really time travel  is loosely styled after dw and there are rick and morty reruns  as they are not doing a 2016 season either  edit  forgot to add legends of tomorrow as another time travel viewing option ,d00pb2y,doctorwho,television,1455550344,Starlifter141,1,0,12,886,0.0

look  i love 12 he s my favourite doctor  but people are just assuming he s being pushed out he most likely is not and in fairness  capaldi prepared us for this months ago he said series 10 could be his last  that despite him previously saying he d do it forever if he could  it s hard and can be very tiring  if capaldi is indeed leaving  it will be of his own choice  not because he was pushed out bbc already made that mistake with colin baker and 12 is arguably the most popular and well received doctor since tennant was around i personally preferred smith over tennant  but that aside  capaldi is extremely popular bbc are nt dumb  and they re not going to push him out because if they did that  there would be a fan outrageoutburst and they d be levelled with complaints in the hundreds of thousands  if not millions  if capaldi is leaving  which is unconfirmed   then it ll be his choice  and also the bookies thing does nt mean anything did nt they do the same thing when people thought david tennant was regenerating in the stolen earth  it s the same situation here  only they re taking advantage of the fact that there s a year of no doctor who and coupling it with fan panic about capaldi staying on or leaving and they re doing this  which in turn is causing people more panic  people  simple fact is  as great as 12 is  if capaldi is leaving  it s   his   choice ,d01k3bu,doctorwho,television,1455597448,AWildDorkAppeared,1,0,1,7067,0.0

do nt know what set me researching this and i m not certain what  if any  actual bearing it holds but i ve noticed that between the rtd and moffat eras the female companions started predominantly wearing skirts instead of jeanstrousers  i can only remember rose wearing a denim skirt  tooth and claw  and a maids uniform  age of steel  but primarily wearing jeans the rest of the time  martha i do nt think ever wore one in the show  ca nt speak for comics  donna was introduced in her wedding dress and wore appropriate dresses in historical episodes but mostly was in jeanssweater combos  lady christina and adelaide brook wore practical trousers rosita  not sure if she counts  obviously wore victorian duds  by comparison  i struggle to think of episodes where amy pond or clara wore trousers  the only examples that spring to mind are pandorica twoparter and face the raven   river stretches the trend as she was only in one rtd era story but she went from a space suit to loosefitting dresses for the most part  does this matter or mean anything  maybe a result of the showrunners differing sexual orientations  moffat has referred to amy and clara inuniverse predominantly as  girls   maybe more gendered clothing is a reflection of this  again  this likely does nt mean anything it s just a trend i noticed ,45b8bs,doctorwho,television,1455226637,mathomas1993,4,0,1,32,0.0
amy s job involved dressing up and then eventually she was a model so her clothes made perfect sense rose was literally a chav and what she wore is typical of a chav  jeans and tshirts  or tracksuits  fashion is also an era thing rose was in 20052006  and her style changed when she returned in 2008 amy was early 2010 s which is known for a lot of girls wearing skirts and the likes  likewise  clara wears fashion that is typical of mid 2010 s girls  it does nt matter what they were it s not a political statement  or anything they re just dressed in ways that suit their personalities and fashion senses it does nt mean anything ,czwnoyd,doctorwho,television,1455234109,AWildDorkAppeared,10,0,1,7067,0.0
most of the time  the showrunners have little to no influence on the companion s costume amy s miniskirts were something that karen gillan and the costume designer came up with together and i assume that clara s dresses  she s definitely a dress girl  she s usually going for a sweater and dress combo instead of skirts  came from a similar place it s just two characters who happen to not wear trousers much  so i really do nt think there s a  skirt agenda  at play here ,czwk8vf,doctorwho,television,1455228995,WikipediaKnows,6,0,13484,30698,1.0

i think you re overthinking it putting aside differences in character  you have to remember that fashion changes  there s six years between rose s and amy s debuts  that s a lot of time for looks to change the jeans look was popular back in 05  just like skirts and tights came into fashion a few years back they re just wearing what the popular style is at the time ,czwkwl7,doctorwho,television,1455229890,stop___grammar_time,3,0,5528,20484,0.0
the clothes which the characters wear are more the costume designer s decision with the actors also getting a say  karen gillan has mentioned that the reason why amy wore short skirts was because she wanted her to wear them  jenna coleman has also mentioned that she had some input in what clara wore she said that she wanted her to look like a woman in her 20s from london who is with the fashion but is nt trying too hard  i think there are also some other out of universe reasons for the characters clothes for example in universe it seems impractical for clara to wear high heels but out of universe jenna had to wear them more often than not because they would nt manage to fit her into a shot with mattpeter  it s not like she never wore trousers  since you mention face the raven  you might as well mention heaven senthell bent i m pretty sure she also wore trousers in the girl who died as well as flatline for example  protokun7 has already mentioned all the episodes in which amy wore trousers  there have also been several for river  though for some of them  she also wore a dress as well   silence in the libraryforest of the dead time of angelsflesh and stone the pandorica opensthe big bang the impossible astronautday of the moon wedding of river song  well in the last scene  so all in all  it s actually only clara who is wearing skirtsdresses most of the time but it s not like young women who wear skirtdresses most of the time do nt exist it s been a few years since i was in school but for many of my female teachers it was pretty common to dress in a similar fashion as clara did  though not anywhere nearly as trendy as her  ,czx9jot,doctorwho,television,1455284530,SilenceFall,3,0,1,2194,0.0
it does nt particularly matter  no those characters just like wearing skirts  rose also wore a victorian dress in  the unquiet dead   a denim skirt again in  boom town  and an eraappropriate dress in  the idiot s lantern   martha wore a dress in  the lazarus experiment  and a maid s outfit in  human nature    the family of blood   donna  as you said  wore a wedding dress in  the runaway bride   local garb in  the fires of pompeii  and a dress in  the unicorn and the wasp   amy did wear jeans during   the tardis scenes in  amy s choice   both dream tardis and real tardis    the lodger    the big bang  when she was seen leaving the note    the pandorica opens    the big bang   as you said    the impossible astronaut    day of the moon   as did river    the rebel flesh    the almost people    asylum of the daleks    dinosaurs on a spaceship    the power of three    the angels take manhattan  she wore shorts in  the hungry earth    cold blood   trousers in  the girl who waited    closing time  and  the wedding of river song   not going to go through clara s list right now  with all the running around the companions do  having the trousers is the practical option unless they want to wear skirts short enough not to risk impeding leg movement amy liked short skirts so there was no problem there ,czwmflu,doctorwho,television,1455232111,ProtoKun7,4,0,2912,111542,1.0

gt  martha i do nt think ever wore one in the show  ca nt speak for comics  she did wear a maid outfit in the family of blood two parter  gt  maybe a result of the showrunners differing sexual orientations  iwhat  that was not the direction i was expecting this to go i was expecting a good ol  moffat is sexist rant  but i am pleasantly surprised and confused  in what universe are you living in where basic clothing fashion  sexual orientation i just do nt see the connection  gt  moffat has referred to amy and clara inuniverse predominantly as  girls   maybe more gendered clothing is a reflection of this  and now you are talking about gender  which also is nt connected to clothing choices  gt  again  this likely does nt mean anything it s just a trend i noticed  i think it does show what type of character they are  for example the commentary on amy s wikipedia article  gt  in the first episode  costume designer ray holman stated that amy s identity was not clear and that she wore her own clothes later on gillan thought that amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed  a bit of skin from time to time   gillan said she tried on many things  but when it came to short skirts she  just thought it was right  and showed that amy was  comfortable and confident about her look  she believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age executive producer piers wenger also noted that amy s 1970s flying jacket  which she wears  quite a lot   reflected gillan was a  born adventurer  and amy developed a love for travel and adventure in the sixth series  amy wears more jeans and longer trousers  gillan stated   she s getting a little bit more tomboyish as she becomes more of an action girl   amy never wears heels  as gillan desired that the footwear be functional for saving the world   also notice moffat had little say in amy s outfits  it could also just be a difference in the of style the 2000s vs the 2010s the 2000s loved their leather jackets and acid washed skinny jeans while the 10s do nt shy away from pretty skirts  you could also look at class and profession rose and donna were lower class and martha was focused on education to become a doctor these lives do nt lend themselves to glitter and glamour army s parents  when she had them  were probably well off to afford such a big house ,czwk4mo,doctorwho,television,1455228837,LegoK9,1,0,594,12954,0.0

sontaren strategem i m fine withother than the really annoying kid  but then i think that was the point of his character  the end of time just made me dislike the 10th doctor  that s why i dislike it he was full of life and energy but went out depressed it was also a bloody awful way of transitioning to 11  it felt like you were meant to hate 11 for taking over  which is just a terrible way of introducing a new doctor and it spent way too long on the legacy  of rtd  9 and 11 had much better regenerations in comparison they went out positively and 11 s regeneration did nt hang too long on the past they showed amy for a couple seconds  he made a speech about change being good whilst still showing appreciation for what he d done and he was gone it was a great way of saying goodbye to 11 and his legacy whilst introducing 12  i could have done away with clara s i miss 11  plot point  since she probably understood regeneration the most out of all the modern companions and it felt shoehorned in  but i suppose it was to help the fans who only liked 1011 for their youthlooks  if steven and capaldi both leave at the end of series 10  then i suppose we ll see how he handles giving a legacy  goodbye compared to rtd ,d01swuw,doctorwho,television,1455624428,jarkortheburninator,2,0,1,184,0.0
sontaron stratagem is ok nothing spectacular but fine  the end of time on the other hand i was really disappointed with to me it did poorly by the master s character  i was never a fan of the drums and i find the resolution of it with the time lords really lacklustre and unnecessarily convoluted for what ultimately just leads to just shooting a machine to stop the time lords and then after that disappointment the last 20 minutes is just a selfcongratulatory sequence which did nt feel deserved after what i had just watched i should note however that at this time i was pretty jaded by rtd s era so i just was nt in the frame of mind to celebrate his era ,d01sbae,doctorwho,television,1455622224,loonongrass,1,0,76,4180,0.0

welcome to the fandom  my advice for you is to stay away from uberfans with zany fan theories  and never read about what s going on behind the scenes doctor who fans are notorious for killing their own  and ruining a great show with their criticism enjoy the show on your own terms  and never let anyone else tell you which doctor  or which episode  or which writer is the best that s left to you to make up on your own if you do that  doctor who will be one of the most enjoyable shows you could ever watch  again  welcome to the fandom   ,d01rkkg,doctorwho,television,1455619192,PostcardPoet,3,0,1,83,0.0

 we are all stories in the end just make it a good one   we all change  when you think about it we re all different people all through our lives  and that s okay  that s good  you ve got to keep moving  so long as you remember all the people that you used to be i will not forget one line of this  not one day  i swear i will always remember when the doctor was me   you could replace  the doctor  with  the high school student  or  the undergraduate  depending on what you re graduating from    do nt give up not ever not for one single day be safe  if you can be but always be amazing   what s the point of being grown up if you ca nt be childish sometimes   as we learn about each other  so we learn about ourselves   just one question  do you happen to know how to fly this thing    funny because nobody knows how to manage their lives when they re about to graduate and go onto a new thing haha  basically like every time the doctor regenerates    when you re a kid  they tell you it s all grow up  get a job  get married  get a house  have a kid and that s it but the truth is  the world is so much stranger than that it s so much darker and so much madder and so much better   every life is a pile of good things and bad things the good things do nt always soften the bad things but vice versa  the bad things do nt necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant   before i go  i just want to tell you  you were fantastic absolutely fantastic and you know what  so was i  if you want something short and sweet  you could always opt for  allonsy   or  geronimo   congrats on graduating soon  cheers amp  good luck ,d017uzz,doctorwho,television,1455577843,ManWhoNeverWould,7,0,1,100,0.0
great show to choose a quote from  i love the 11th  he said some great things  never knowingly be serious      the way i see it  every life is a pile of good things and  bad things the good things don  t always soften the bad things  but vice versa  the bad things don  t necessarily spoil the good things      we are all stories in the end  eh  just make it a good one  i do nt remember it correctly but there s also one from  amy s choice  i think where the doctor says something like  something s not right let s point it with a stick  now onto 12th  sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones  but you still have to choose  maybe change it a bit but i think this is just brilliant  you asked me if you were a good man and the answer is  i do nt know but i think you try to be and i think that s probably the point   pain is a gift without the capacity for pain  we ca nt feel the hurt we inflict  these are my favourites and i think each one would make a great seniour quote  some changed a bit but whatever ,d017lf6,doctorwho,television,1455577433,Vergilus123,3,0,1,70,0.0

1  iirc  clara tossed herself into the doctor s timestream to save him from getting killed at trenzalore this scattered her throughout his life  over and over again and again  2  iirc  turns out that was gallifrey trying to peak out from the timepocket he stuck it in at the climax of the time war  and again later   and wound up getting closed up again after they gave him another set of regenerations  and set him on the path of eventually finding a way to free them or something i kinda forget that part  3  that was rose  when she gazed into the eye of eternity and took on a chunk of the power that fuels the tardis  sending both herself and the doctor a message scattered randomly back in time  to lead them to the point where she could gaze into the eye of eternity and take on a chunk of the power that fuels the tardis iow  she made it a selffulfilling prophecy so that she could have the power to dropkick the dalek fleet ,d01fn66,doctorwho,television,1455590210,RichardMHP,2,0,3562,18064,0.0
1  at trenzalore  the great intelligence jumps into the doctor s time stream and starts messing his life up in order to undo all the damage  clara also jumps into the doctor s time stream and gets scattered through his life  so she supposedly has seen every regeneration of the doctor and saved him in little ways throughout his life eleven goes in and saves her  which gives us the clara we now know  2  basically  the cracks in space and time were erasing events from time  and the doctor said the only way to close such a crack was for it to consume a complicated spacetime event he reached into the crack at one point and pulled out a piece of the tardis  so then he realized what he needed to do was fly the tardis into it and let it consume him he was able to come back because amy and rory remembered him and their adventures with him there was one residual crack  however  which you see when eleven is defending christmas the time lords found it and were trying to come through but eleven would nt let them because he knew it would restart the time war but clara ended up convincing the time lords to give the doctor a new regeneration cycle using that crack before they closed it  3  bad wolf was a message rose sent to herself from the future she used the power from staring into the heart of the tardis to scatter the words bad wolf  taken from bad wolf corporations  the name of the company that took over satellite 5  which was actually run by the daleks  randomly throughout her time stream it was a message to herself to go back to save the nine  basically  after he sent her home  hope this helps  if you have anymore questions let us know ,d01gfwn,doctorwho,television,1455591469,ManWhoNeverWould,2,0,1,100,0.0
1  the great intelligence enters the doctor s time stream  splitting himself across all of the doctor s lives throughout all of time  trying to rewrite his every victory into failure clara enters the time stream to try to prevent that and she too is split across all of the doctor s lives  only she is born and grows up in multiple lives  each time helping andor saving the doctor in some way  even little ways  2  the cracks in space and time were caused by the tardis exploding when the universe ends  everything is slowly dying the pandorica contains a cell from every living thing in the universe and therefore can be used to  reboot  the universe  essentially reverse the effects of it ending  if only it can be spread simultaneously across all of time the only way to do that is to fly it into the exploding tardis the doctor does this  time reverses and the cracks close  with only the doctor and river remembering because they re time lords  and amy and rory remember because amy has that ability because she grew up next to the time crack  and her bond with rory allowed her to save his memories too  however  not all cracks closed as the loop was not yet finished once back on trenzalore  the doctor discovered a crack and with help from handles the cyberman head and the seal of rassilon  is able to decode a message coming through the crack and realises that it s the time lords on the other side the want the doctor to speak his real name so they ll know it s safe to emerge back into the proper universe unforetunately  he refuses to do so they keep trying but he wo nt do it clara however  convinces them to give him some new regenerations and they then close the final crack themselves  opting to emerge back into the universe but position themselves near the very end of it billions and billions of years in the future so that they re safe  you learn this in series 9  3  the bad wolf is rose absorbing the heart of the tardis into herself she is essentially like idris  but instead she s in rose s body she then reveals that the bad wolf message they kept encountering was something she herself did  and then she proceeds to do it  taking the words and scattering them throughout time so that 9 and rose will always end up there in those moments  to ensure bad wolf is born a perfect loop ,d01jn01,doctorwho,television,1455596650,AWildDorkAppeared,1,0,1,7067,0.0

so i ve just started watching the classic series  from the beginning i am only at the daleks episode and it s really boring me  unlike any of the nuwho episodes so my question is  does it change at any time with the classic series  do the episodes get shorter and more like the newer ones or is it all divided into up to 7  who thought it s a good idea  part miniserials ,45y4bc,doctorwho,television,1455563711,Vergilus123,2,0,1,70,0.0

the best way to watch the classic series is not to watch it all in order few people who were watching it in 1980 had also been watching it in 1963 just jump around the series and watch the good episodes first that s what i did and i am very glad that s how i did it  i d recommend city of death  4th doctor   remembrance of the daleks  7th doctor   spearhead from space  3rd doctor   earthshock  5th doctor  or genesis of the daleks  4th doctor  to start ,d01tx2z,doctorwho,television,1455627507,Koquillon,3,0,537,4673,0.0
if you re new to classics  do nt try watching from the start in order the black and white era can be a killer to get through if you only know the new stuff  and the long serials were never designed to be watched all the way through in one sitting  i d recommend jumping around to some of the well regarded stories of different doctors and styles  to sample what s on offer and seeing what you like  rather than trying to marathon a show that was never made to be marathoned  i d personally recommend  third doctor  spearhead from space  carnival of monsters fourth doctor  the ark in space  the seeds of doom  city of death fifth doctor  kinda  the caves of androzani seventh doctor  remembrance of the daleks give these a go  and if any of the eras interests you  jump around  see what else is well regarded or interesting  and give that a go if watching longer serials bores you  try splitting a story over two days,d01168s,doctorwho,television,1455567955,TheRabbitTest,5,0,573,2018,0.0
the whole classic series is in a serial format so each story is multiple episodes though they differ in length if you are watching the serials in one sitting i would suggest spreading out your viewing of the episodes so it does nt bore you ,d00ytc9,doctorwho,television,1455564536,LanternOfOa,1,0,1,1027,0.0
if you are new to classic who it can take a while to get used to them classic who production values are very different from those of new who and can be an acquired taste i grew up watching the classics but in the black and white years aren  t my favorite ones  even so you can find great and good stories among the less good ones for each doctor you may want to start with the best episodes of each classic doctor you can search for posts on the subject  probably more of them in rgallifrey  or look in the faq here for the section on best of the classic who episodes  edit  text correction,d012356,doctorwho,television,1455569252,Starlifter141,1,0,12,886,0.0
i really dislike  the daleks   myself i watched it early and it gave me a very bad impression of hartnell that took years to get over  i ll echo the others  advice to stop going in order and switch to another doctor maybe try to find a story that features a villain you enjoy  watch  genesis of the daleks  for daleks or  the sea devils  for the master or you can figure out what style of story you like  alien invasion  historical setting  and try to find a classic story that s structured in the same way that way  you ve got a bit of an anchor back to the familiarthis is the kind of modern doctor who you enjoy  so classic will feel less foreign to you if the villain or plot structure is similar ,d019rcy,doctorwho,television,1455580870,janisthorn2,1,0,65,5455,1.0
it stays as multipart miniserials  but they differ in length and quality for instance the next story   the edge of destruction   is only two parts which is roughly the length of one new who episode since they re 20 minutes to the current 40 i got burned out trying to marathon it too  most people suggest skipping ahead to the good episodes or sampling a story or two from each doctor to see how you like them ,d00ylq0,doctorwho,television,1455564237,ChronaMewX,1,0,1268,38997,0.0
gt  i am only at the daleks episode and it s really boring me  unlike any of the nuwho episodes  not surprising i ve only seen a few of the classics  but they just do nt have the modern nuwho quality they re fun to watch in retrospect to see the cheesiness and see how far the show has come and changed in 50 years you do nt have to watch them if they are nt interesting you can skip around to other doctors if you want  gt  so my question is  does it change at any time with the classic series  do the episodes get shorter and more like the newer ones or is it all divided into up to 7 part miniserials  save for the five doctors and mission to the unknown  they re all multipart serials ranging from 2 to 14 parts  around 25 minutes each  gt   who thought it s a good idea  serialized tv was very common in the 60s it really only continued for doctor who into the 80s out of tradition and saving money on sets and props ,d00ywyz,doctorwho,television,1455564681,LegoK9,0,0,594,12954,0.0
if you re expecting the kind of spectacle the new series is known foryou ll be disappointed classic who was from an era when they were transitioning from long  detailed radio drama s to modern television so you get slower  more detailed  stories spread over more episodes  that said  the first two doctors are quite unlike the rest hartnell most of all the reason being is because the show was originally conceived with ian as the main character  the strong  heroic male lead  and the doctor as the plot device he does develop a fair bit though and troughton is when you see him taking on much of his noticeable attributes  my advice  start with tom baker s first season he s probably the easiest for nuwho fans to connect with and the season is awesome  sarah jane is my all time favorite companion  genesis of the daleks introduces a major character and is generally considered one of the best classic serials  and ark in space is well loved too   if you like him keep going you ll get acclimated to the style and might have an easier time with the old episodes ,d015vlv,doctorwho,television,1455574814,LordDaccat,0,0,17,6561,0.0

i ve a pretty big doctor who fan  but i only started watching about 2 years ago i went season 2  season 1 and then the rest because i knew tennant could get me sucked into this show probably did nt need to  i m thinking about doing a rewatch but my temptation is to go straight to season 5 as in my mind it s going to be harder to go back to the lower production value of the earlier seasons i watched a lot of the early seasons on a tablet on the train and some on netflix in the evening  but i did nt remember some pretty corny sets and monsters and the like the beginning of s5 blew away my expectations of the show with the visual style upgrade and just the tone shifted so much  should i just go straight to s5 and enjoy myself and go back further if time allows or should i just take my time going through the earlier stuff  as i have another 10 months of waiting for more who ,45bwka,doctorwho,television,1455235417,bomer,7,0,185,28,0.0
gt  should i just go straight to s5 and enjoy myself and go back further if time allows or should i just take my time going through the earlier stuff  as i have another 10 months of waiting for more who  if you re worried about the quality of the older series being bad  they d probably seem even worse after seeing the newer series fresh you ve got 10 months  i d start from 9 and watch as the cinematography and effects improve over the years ,czwpdrw,doctorwho,television,1455236898,LegoK9,3,0,594,12954,0.0

if you re really into the show and the characters and the stories they have to tell  lower production should nt affect anything i can understand why you think it would  but most of the time you do nt even notice if you let yourself get immersed in the story some of the best nuwho episodes are definitely scattered through seasons 14  and i think they re worth watching it also gives you more appreciation for the growth of the show into season 5 if you re simply watching it for entertainment  i guess you could start at season 5 and be fine but if you really want to understand the characters  especially the doctor  and allow yourself to become immersed in the show  i would stay start from season 1 ,czxri14,doctorwho,television,1455311280,ManWhoNeverWould,1,0,1,100,0.0

i personally started with pertwee and watched every doctor s first and last episodes from there  going back to hartnell and troughton afterward   i only stopped to hit a few  must watch  episodes  such as genesis of the daleks  as dictated by fans online  and some titles that took my interest this seems to be the best way to watch it  in my personal opinion ,d02i0kc,doctorwho,television,1455663812,Blue_Sparx,1,0,1,143,0.0
i m 37  and i remember doctor who airing on pbs late saturday evenings when i was a child growing up in the late 70s  and early 80s my first recollection of doctor who was when tom baker was the doctor i also remember k9 and was enamored by the little tin dog  for whatever reason i quit watching the show not too long after the 4th doctor regenerated for the fifth time who knows why  who knows   get it   anyway  fast forward over 30 years later  and i find myself surrounded by  whovians  i had never heard the term before  but just about everyone i know enjoyed watching the new doctor who series that we ve all come to love i was peerpressured into watching doctor who again  and i reluctantly gave in the 50th anniversary special was upon us  and i decided to give the show a go even though i had no knowledge of what was going on then  the scene at the end where the doctor meets the  great curator   and tom baker appears in all of his magnificence  and suddenly the tears come streaming down my face  there he was  my doctor  i had chills down my spine because it was the doctor i knew in that moment  i made the decision to become a rabid fan i started with season one of the new doctor who series  and i fell in love with doctor who all over again i m glad i did not research the show prior to watching any of the episodes because every show was a surprise to me i was sad when the 9th doctor regenerated into the 10th  and so on  to this day  i have immersed myself in doctor who i love this fandom  and i love talking about doctor who with other fans thank the time lords for this amazing reddit forum  and all of you other whovians ,461ydc,doctorwho,television,1455619768,PostcardPoet,19,0,1,83,0.0

answer  literally almost nothing   1  it s airing in 2017   2  moffat has an idea of what the companion will be like but there has been no auditions held or official casting done yet   3  radio times says that it ll start filming may 2016 so that it ll be ready to air in earlyspring 2017  4  there ll be one episode this year  the 2016 christmas special then 13 episodes in 2017  12 normal plus 1 christmas    5  peter capaldi has said it might be his last year  which personally i think sucks  but he said he wants to do other things too so yeah  ,d01o490,doctorwho,television,1455606552,AWildDorkAppeared,4,0,1,7067,0.0
last night at the grammys  when kendrick lamar won the award for best rap album  a few rows behind him a guy who looked like david tennant was one of the very first people to give kendrick a standing ovation upon closer inspection and pausing the video  i was sad to discover that it was  in fact  not tennant boo but i could still imagine ten s taste in music being so varied that he d like kendrick  so we know that ten likes ian dury and  maybe  ray palmer jr a previous incarnation hung out with janis joplin the beatles famously cameoed during the first doctor s run twelve definitely loves his electric guitar after last night s  false  appearance  i started to wonder  what realworld human musicians would the other doctors listen to  are some doctors open to a wider array of music than other doctors  note  we wo nt count music on the show played by other characters unless the doctor is clearly enjoying them onscreen for example  we saw the master dance to the scissor sisters  but that does nt mean that ten likes them ,463wu9,doctorwho,television,1455648475,Cyke101,11,0,1100,18327,0.0
