my personal view is that he is aware that he is a bastard it s pretty much thought throughout the seven kingdoms that he is but people fear saying it for obvious reasons it s the rumor everyone suspects but can not support because you will end up being killed like ned stark and there is really only circumstantial evidence  joffrey clings to his lannister heritage because his father never really loved him his mother always doted on him in addition he is at war with his  uncle  who is a baratheon he only uses the baratheon title as it suits his legacy he only invokes robert when trying to verbally hurt tywin his  legitimacy  is a relationship of convenience so he can maintain power he knows deep down what he is even if he ca nt or would nt prove it  i ca nt recall exactly but is nt there a scene where joffrey mentions  rumors  about his mother and  uncle  jaime also myrcella admits she s always known jaime is her father i know it s a different character but it does nt take much to make the leap tommen  i believe  is just naive and oblivious ,czzoqbt,gameofthrones,television,1455469642.0,Ravager135,10.0,0.0,1,4055,0.0

his whole situation confuses me a bit  but i do nt think he knew about his true lineage  or chose to ignore it i forget which book it comes up in but  book spoilers    b  it is implied that he was behind the plot to try and assassinate bran because he overheard his father  robert said something along the lines of killing horses when they break a leg but lack ability to offer the same mercy to crippled children so he hired the assassin to try to get his fathers  approval why would he want roberts approval when he is always flaunting lannister colors and acting like a lion i guess cersei really messed up his mind   also  if he knew his true parentage he would actually be a bastard because his parents were nt married when he was born so it would be joffrey waters  pretty sure he was born in kings landing  ,czzklyt,gameofthrones,television,1455461708.0,abrahamdrinkin,99.0,0.0,568,5756,0.0
why is it presumed only the faces of the dead are kept there  before she went blind arya saw her own face on another person  as for the significance of  the dead come with it   pointing to the those who are still alive and presumed dead come simply imply that those characters will have an impact on the long nightwhich the inevitable winterdespite their mortality many of the characters  actions echo throughout the realm even after they have died  many other characters have died as well  but the ones shown that have died have had arguably the greatest shifts in the direction of events due to their impact while alive and the shifts that occurred due to their absence  and those still alive are the ones still left to leave their mark and should they fall will have the greatest impact from their absence ,d00exrr,gameofthrones,television,1455518179.0,TracyMorganFreeman,12.0,0.0,1158,160056,0.0
thats a lot of typing to say very little the idea that jon snow s statement is used to introduce those that will fight the dead is very wishful thinking it s nice to hold on to hope watching this series unfold  but let s be reasonable with it if this trailer is saying anything at all  it is definitely not hopeful i still think there is a slight chance for a happy ending  but i do nt think this teaser is the place to find that i also believe that there is a much greater chance for this series to end in a very tragic manner ,d00bcaq,gameofthrones,television,1455509788.0,glabuz11,48.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

frankly  i m tired of being teased  and this teaser in particular  told us even less than the ones posted to twitter a few weeks back i doubt any of the faces have any significance other than to summarize the big moments throughout the series ned stark s face was there  and we know for a fact  it rotted off his skull atop a spike in king s landing there s no way the faceless men have a copy they need the body to produce one it s why they wash all the sacrifices and drag them off to that chamber ,d00bl5u,gameofthrones,television,1455510296.0,ElvisDepressedIy,29.0,0.0,1,2541,0.0

it s common knowledge by this point that jon snow will be coming backthough whether it s as his reborn self or something else  is unknown  personally  i think you re just overanalyzing a rather mediocre teaser trailer that told us absolutely nothing the main thing i m with you on is that the major theme was the living vs the dead as the starks amp  redemption are going to be a big part of s6  this teaser is likely to remind us of the dead charactersto weave in that plot of redemption and remind us that there will be some kind of retribution for the lannisters amp  boltons ,d01kbw9,gameofthrones,television,1455597896.0,GreenSkyFish,1.0,0.0,100,10454,0.0

ultimately i d say that there is no big secret meaning in this trailer remember all men must die so eventually the fm will have these faces regardless of our story i guess if you want to call it foreshadowing or something you can  but i would nt and i d say that all of the people in shot 6 will be dead by the end of book seven  rickon and bran are omitted 1 to carry the stark name  1 to be a tree ,d00dizv,gameofthrones,television,1455514584.0,MarwyntheMasterful,10.0,0.0,1,213,0.0
here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit ,d00kqnl,gameofthrones,television,1455539761.0,athze2,13.0,0.0,1,791,0.0

______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

ok  so the husband and i have been rewatching season 5  and in episode 10   mother s mercy   we noticed a scene with samwell and jon snow where he is letting sam and gilly go to the citadel so that sam can train to become a maester  we noticed that as sam and gilly leave  the look of stricken guilt on sam s face leaving castle black  at the end of this episode  jon snow  as  lord commander  of the nights watch meets an untimely demise from his brothers in black is there is a possible connection to this  does sam know before leaving what fate jon faces from his brothers  or would they have kept that from him knowing how close him and jon were  let me know what you think ,45vena,gameofthrones,television,1455521938.0,Hefferella503,1.0,0.0,1208,1815,0.0
the wall does nt always tower over its surroundings it s higher in some places and lower in others he must have found a low point  which would make sense  because winterfell is pretty far west of castle black and he could ve run a long way looking for a place to cross  like  presumably  wildlings do all the time with their spoils from raiding ,d01zsbt,gameofthrones,television,1455638872.0,sielingfan,1.0,0.0,9108,66632,0.0

well there are possibilities jon will certainly come back  this has been leaked and is without a doubt however  it might not be jon himself  it might just be a vessel to some other entity  bran could warg skinchange into jon and somehow keep him alive undead  yes  he  comes back  but it s not really jon snow  it s just bran in jon s body   i find this unlikely but the first teaser would be very suggestive towards this  the scene of jon dying coupled with the scene of bran warging into hodor  and would explain how jon would know of rl  j  if that is indeed true   if not bran  maybe bloodraven could warg or skinchange into jon  in the books he seems to be responsible for keeping coldhands undead   i still find it unlikely but it might be intereseting  given that bloodraven and the children of the forest might have agendas of their own  could be that some sort of entity representing the lord of light could possess him  if not the lord of light himself  given that he might be azor ahai and all that   i find this very unlikely and would not like it i prefer the idea that there are no gods and that magic is just another part of life  but these are all shots in the dark he s most likely being ressurected with magic  by melisandre and return as himself  just different ,d00vanz,gameofthrones,television,1455559515.0,rayluaza,4.0,0.0,39,947,0.0

so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies ,45l30b,gameofthrones,television,1455379387.0,stos313,128.0,0.0,77,798,0.0
there could be a certain amount of fuck it just slow them down  going into the headshots in the books  when mormont sends thorne south to king s landing with the dead wight s hand in a jar  he mentions this in the show too   the hand is still alive  and moving for most of thorne s journey by the time he gets to king s landing it s just a dead hand  but when he left castle black  it was solid proof that magic was back in play  anyway what that means  as far as the rules go  is that the brain is nt really in play it s likely some sort of rangebased magic  you never see big hordes of undead moving without white walkers nearby the only way to stop the wights is to stop the walkers ,czylfi8,gameofthrones,television,1455383279.0,sielingfan,37.0,0.0,9108,66632,0.0
white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely decomposes  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them ,czym1ca,gameofthrones,television,1455384334.0,MakingTheEight,32.0,0.0,55,1365,0.0
it s likely that the first wights were cushioning the fall for the ones that fell on them  which would mean less damage for them the fact is  the white walkers have wights to spare  and they seem perfectly happy with sacrificing a few if it means they can get more  it seems that while headshots can work  you have to completely destroy the head  and even then  we ve seen that the limps can remain active  plus  you have to remember  these wights do seem to degrade  so the skeletons are just older  while the fresher wights are more human looking and it seems like for the resurrection to work  the white walkers must be close by we saw the night s king do it with very little effort ,czyjsy5,gameofthrones,television,1455380412.0,Rosebunse,12.0,0.0,40,111531,0.0
if i am correct  white walkers  also called others  are alive  cursed sons of craster and probably other little kids that they could found in the north zombies and skeletons are called wights  are dead people that were reanimated by white walkers  i think that they can be reanimated as many times as white walkers want  as long as their bodies are not burned  altough if they are dismembered they are nt realy able to do much essos  no white walkers  no zombies,czylx05,gameofthrones,television,1455384121.0,Palfi,6.0,0.0,247,9502,0.0

the hardest part vs white walkers is how to reduce casualties on yourside while inflecting casulaties on their side for white walkers every wright death is not a loss  only their commanders count your side  every person s death becomes a number on white walker s army  if you happen to lose a few heros  say the hound   they retain their fighting style and now they are like robert strong this makes the battle very difficult ,czyvh3r,gameofthrones,television,1455401050.0,sephelutis,6.0,0.0,1,19,0.0

white walkersothers are definitely vulnerable to valyrian steel and obsidian in hardhome their natural cold seemed to diminish the effects of nearby fire but i suspect that a lot of projectile fire would do the trick people burn the dead bodies to prevent them returning as wights  which are the zombie like creatures that are killed only by fire or severe dismemberment,czzead1,gameofthrones,television,1455439110.0,markusalkemus66,1.0,0.0,1039,5494,0.0
not many rules understood it was discovered by sam that dragon glass kills ww  and dragon class is a result of volcanoes  another name for it obsidian jon was the only who discovered that valerian steel works too  it s knowledge is lost as well but everyone s got an itch that fire or dragons or volcanoes are involved  grrm says he relates valerian steel to damascus steel in real life and that it s knowledge was lost as well among other similarities  minus the magic offcourse  as for wights  aka your zombies  p they are stopped via chopping them into pieces or by fire the ww in hardhome that jon fought extinguished the fire before entering into the big tent  so i doubt fire works on them and i think it was mentioned in many sources it does nt work  except dragon s fire  that should work on both ww and wights as for the headshots  well  i guess they are just missing their headseyes so they are slowed as we saw in bran s battle with the wights  they do nt die or stop completely if you chop off their arms or heads  the two methods are burning or chopping them into many bits  slow them down enough they are nt a threat i guess ,czzg7wd,gameofthrones,television,1455447459.0,spooket,1.0,0.0,1,322,0.0

i know this topic has been beat up on here  but i have nt seen a good discussion in a while i was looking at grrm s    1993 draft   http  watchersonthewallcomgeorgerrmartinsoriginalplangamethrones    of the layout for what was originally supposed to be only three books  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point  although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  amp  nbsp  he speaks of of three major conflicts that still hold till this day and seem to be central in asoiaf they are  1  starks vs lannisters 2  danny invading the seven kingdoms with a dorthraki army  grrm writes that this is the  second and greater threat  than the starks vs lannisters    3  the others  grrm writes that this is  the greatest danger of all   amp  nbsp  what is interesting is that these broad strokes for the three conflicts still stand central to the book and show  and they show us where he is going with the story my focus is on conflicts 2 and 3 conveniently  the end of season 5 has dany run into another dorthraki army fits in perfectly with what he wrote in 1993 about conflict 2  which would have dany invading the seven kingdoms fully loaded with dragons and a complete dorthraki army looking at conflict 3  we are told that grrm planned to  draw together the characters and plot threads  to prepare for the final battle with the others  which is another direction he has not strayed from  amp  nbsp  on top of these conflicts  grrm writes about the essentially confirmed theory of rl  j he notes   jon s true parentage is finally revealed in the last book  considering that in 1993 his plan was to write only three books and now we will have seven it is likely that jon s parentage will be revealed in either book 6 or 7  i find it more likely that it will be bookseason 6   amp  nbsp  the final point i wanted to make is that of the   f  ive central characters that will make it through all three volumes  they are  tyrion  dany  jon  arya  and bran all these central characters are alive and well  just as he planned in 1993 it is my belief that they will remain alive through the end because these characters  along with the three conflicts  were the foundation of his original draft  and as we are about 34s done with the story we have seen that these conflicts and characters have stood the test of time  amp  nbsp  some of you are probably sick and tired of this draft  but i find it very useful before i start getting attacked about how this or that did nt happen as was written in the draft  i want to point out that i am not focusing on the specifics he was writing about in this draft  i am talking more of the broad strokes he is speaking of i personally think that this draft should hold great weight when trying to theorize where this is going  amp  nbsp  i wanted to see what everyone thinks as to how much weight we should place into this draft considering all the broad strokes still stand furthermore  i wanted to see what else you think this draft reveals  and what are its implications on the endgame  amp  nbsp  thanks for hearing me out  amp  nbsp  edit  grammar and formatting,461b9t,gameofthrones,television,1455605723.0,glabuz11,22.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

house starks words  winter is coming  after around my 4th rewatch i started to get a vibe around season 1 the things characters said about the starks and their words  the things sam says about jon later on  my theory  i guess you could call it is  winter is coming means in the end  the starks will win  in the end  the starks always come back  in the end  just like the seasons  no matter how long and hot the summers  no matter how bloody and beaten the family  winter and the starks always come back around i think the winds of winter is setting up to be a huge redemptionvengeance tale for the starks and their lineage winter is here just me trying to take a deeper look in the constant theme of their words prolly nothing  optimistic that its something though id love to hear any supporting excerpts and such down below discuss ,466f98,gameofthrones,television,1455681477.0,Zirgy,2.0,0.0,121,349,0.0

so posted in another thread and this got my thinking what do you believe will be the last scene showed in the current tvshow   disregard possible prequels  sequels etc  personally i think it will be either varys  lf walking in the throne room  while some no good king  possibly daenrys gone all mad king  sit at the throne  and talking about the game plotting  the usual businsess varys will say something like  close but not enough  and lf will reply  oh this is merely the beginning of my climb  game of thrones you win or you die  or something along those lines  option b  sam writing down what really happened  after jon sacrificed himself to save the realm  putting the book at some shelf where nobody really ever look till next time winter is coming that is ,466jwa,gameofthrones,television,1455683393.0,toxicaxethrower,2.0,0.0,1,1071,0.0

there s the scene when jon and we learn that craster s boy babies are being given to the white walkers  so it made me wonder  1 do the white walkers only want boy and not girl babies   yes  craster wants to keep his  wives   but wondering if there was something else to them being all boy babies  2 do the white walkers kill the babies who would then turn into white walkers  or do they keep them alive as humans for a time  3 are white walkers who were turned as babies different or magical in some way than ones who turned as adults  4 could ever the white walkers be pacified by being given babies   since they did nt seem to ever attack craster or his daughters ,464lpv,gameofthrones,television,1455656889.0,Miskatonica,4.0,0.0,145,20,0.0

i know this topic has been beat up on here  but i have nt seen a good discussion in a while i was looking at grrm s    1993 draft   http  watchersonthewallcomgeorgerrmartinsoriginalplangamethrones    of the layout for what was originally supposed to be only three books  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point  although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  amp  nbsp  he speaks of of three major conflicts that still hold till this day and seem to be central in asoiaf they are  1  starks vs lannisters 2  danny invading the seven kingdoms with a dorthraki army  grrm writes that this is the  second and greater threat  than the starks vs lannisters    3  the others  grrm writes that this is  the greatest danger of all   amp  nbsp  what is interesting is that these broad strokes for the three conflicts still stand central to the book and show  and they show us where he is going with the story my focus is on conflicts 2 and 3 conveniently  the end of season 5 has dany run into another dorthraki army fits in perfectly with what he wrote in 1993 about conflict 2  which would have dany invading the seven kingdoms fully loaded with dragons and a complete dorthraki army looking at conflict 3  we are told that grrm planned to  draw together the characters and plot threads  to prepare for the final battle with the others  which is another direction he has not strayed from  amp  nbsp  on top of these conflicts  grrm writes about the essentially confirmed theory of rl  j he notes   jon s true parentage is finally revealed in the last book  considering that in 1993 his plan was to write only three books and now we will have seven it is likely that jon s parentage will be revealed in either book 6 or 7  i find it more likely that it will be bookseason 6   amp  nbsp  the final point i wanted to make is that of the   f  ive central characters that will make it through all three volumes  they are  tyrion  dany  jon  arya  and bran all these central characters are alive and well  just as he planned in 1993 it is my belief that they will remain alive through the end because these characters  along with the three conflicts  were the foundation of his original draft  and as we are about 34s done with the story we have seen that these conflicts and characters have stood the test of time  amp  nbsp  some of you are probably sick and tired of this draft  but i find it very useful before i start getting attacked about how this or that did nt happen as was written in the draft  i want to point out that i am not focusing on the specifics he was writing about in this draft  i am talking more of the broad strokes he is speaking of i personally think that this draft should hold great weight when trying to theorize where this is going  amp  nbsp  i wanted to see what everyone thinks as to how much weight we should place into this draft considering all the broad strokes still stand furthermore  i wanted to see what else you think this draft reveals  and what are its implications on the endgame  amp  nbsp  thanks for hearing me out  amp  nbsp  edit  grammar and formatting,461b9t,gameofthrones,television,1455605723.0,glabuz11,22.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

i ve been a firm believer in the idea that got follows the story of ragnarok  and this seems to fit right in i feel that this is a future vision by bran i do nt think that all of these characters will die this upcoming season  but i think the ending of this story will be very tragic in the way of ragnarok  and yes we will see these characters die by the end of the story here is my reasoning  1 bran can have visions of the past  present  and future 2 the weirwood network is a catalyst for visions  and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be weirwood 3 looking at past season s teasers  i noticed that the show runners use clips of things that actually happen in the future  they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting ,d008zpg,gameofthrones,television,1455505282.0,glabuz11,25.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

i think it would bring in the world from the show and books beautifully imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent  unless if you have dragon glass or valerian steal of course   all of westeros would of course be included up from the  haunted forest  to  dorn  and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it s entirety  the story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks  the game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of eddard stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen for example if you picked john snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle  benjen stark  has gone missing and your given a mission to try and find out what has happened if you pick sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to castle black of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from  some characters should not be playable at all such as arya stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as sandor and brienne should be playable  important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you become wealthy and powerful enough  i could imagine myself picking a character such as john snow or petyr baelish  haha  and riding one of khaleesi s dragons taking out white walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game  they would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil  what do you all think ,45xzhg,gameofthrones,television,1455562126.0,ThunderousBlade,2.0,0.0,1034,259,0.0

honestly  i do not think the formula that bethesda developed during their last few games would lend itself very well to the asoiaf universe there are three main points in skyrim and fallout 4 that imo would make for a very bad translation into westeros 1 the player always has total freedom to do whatever he wants  no part of the world advances without player input  you can always drop whatever you were doing and go to a totally different place and nobody will mind at all  2 the player is everywhere recognized as  the hero  and every faction you join gives you an important position at the very beginning  3 very little dialogue  that especially in fallout 4 was more or less just an excuse for an  accept mission  screen  i understand that some people might like the notion of playing as peter baelish  who is married to daenerys  can summon dragons  is eddard stark s best friend  lord commander of the night s watch  prince of dorne  leader of the faceless men and hand of the king   all at the same time   or join the night s watch as a nameless recruit  say your vows  then just walk away to the south in order to save eddard stark from execution  next go to tywin lannister in casterly rock  kill a few bandits for him and be named general of his armies  i can see the appeal in such a total sandbox game for some people  but that would be a waste of a universe that heavily builds on its existing story  and if the player is in addition to that also able to influence the outcome of all important events  it would either be extremely expensive to create  write and record a script for the red wedding if any of the characters present might be dead or be in another place  if other characters might be present depending on what the player had done  if the player himself would interfer  how the world would react if the player killed everyone present  if the player had already destroyed the world with dragonfire prior to doing that quest   or  in order to save those costs  the illusion of freedom would only be a lie  eg robb stark would always be present at the red wedding  no matter what the player might do to stop him from going   or if the player performed actions that would change history  it would just correct itself  you can save commander mormont from being betrayed  but he will just be killed by a white walker moments later so jon can become lord commander   at which point  why even do it then  a sandbox game with nameless characters during another time period of anarchy where the paths of the main players are not as clearly defined  like the blackfyre rebellion  might work  but if it is set during the events of the bookshow  i can not see how it would be anything more than tons and tons of fanfiction  with very little of what actually makes asoiaf what it is ,d012ljj,gameofthrones,television,1455569974.0,Sorstalas,4.0,0.0,1,795,0.0

 theory   warning  i am using references from both the show and the book currently  i am reading book one  have watched the entire series  i noticed some recurring dreams about the crypts between the stark family  in the show  bran has a dream that eddard is in the crypts  so he visits them once he awakens rickon and shaggydog are down there as well and says that he also had a dream about their father  without bran ever mentioning his dream to him  in the books  jon tells sam about a dream he has of the crypts and how he does nt want to go to them  but he knows he has to as i have nt gotten very far into the books  i do nt know if it ever mentions arya or sansa having a dream about them  but i believe i read somewhere  or even watched it on the show  that eddard has a dream about the crypts as well  honestly  i ca nt put together a crazy theory as to why that s happening  but i feel that it s very important the crypts are important i read somewhere about a theory of the white walkers taking winterfell because the crypts are magic  or something like that it was much more majestically worded  but i have a pretty bad memory  and i ve learned the consequences as to what happens when you put all of your eggs in one basket  so i wo nt say that it has to be true  just wondering if any of you guys have some cool theories  or just simple reasons  to explain this ,45ni8z,gameofthrones,television,1455408047.0,persici,99.0,0.0,1,40,0.0
some speculate that winterfell serves as a prison it has hot springs so it has volcanic activity  its walls are also heated so essentially if some being of ice were to be trapped in the crypts it would be near impossible to escape  i also believe that hodor saw something down there  damaging his mind with the name of the great other being hodor the only reason to trap such a being and not kill it would be if killing is not possible if the great other is trapped down there that could also explain the unequal seasons it would also explain why the starks are the kings of winter  the physical manifestation of winter is literally their prisoner  would be a nice twist also explains what the white walkers intend to do south of the wall ,czzgj7s,gameofthrones,television,1455448891.0,Phalanx300,16.0,0.0,941,19330,0.0

the character is lady stoneheart  now  let me start by saying that i do not find this likely game of thrones has seemed to find its own groove and does not seem to need lady stoneheart in the mix however  it s not inconceivable  in the new teaser  i found catelyn s  quote   https  youtubeomra8nozf2q  t  39s  to be particularly interesting it s  her line from s03e09   https  youtubessiej1rkjpm  t  1m43s  and it is a particularly vindictive one   show them how it feels to lose what they love  i find it interesting because it definitely reflects lady stoneheart s revenge obssessed character and i was wondering if this could be a clue from damp  d     do you think we ll ever get to see lady stoneheart in the show ,464ewl,gameofthrones,television,1455654561.0,rayluaza,11.0,0.0,39,947,0.0

as people hated that s5 was too much different from books  i think that if damp  d can learn from their mistakes  they will try to return it to be closer to books in s6 as there will be riverrun plotline  there could as well add lsh in  just as in the books  i personaly have feeling that all those dead characters  that had lines in teaser will have big inpact this season   theorytinfoil    g  ned will probably be in important flashbacks  catgt  lsh  rob it could be something from that time when he wanted to make jon legal stark  joffrey it will be either that cersei will start acting as joffrey or that he is head of robert strong  jon nuff said  ,d02fjy1,gameofthrones,television,1455660293.0,Palfi,2.0,0.0,247,9502,0.0

i believe that winterfell is named so because this is where  winter fell   as in where the ww were defeated and a pact was signed  when bran the builder raised the wall  with the intent of keeping out the ww  he probably knew that the ww would attack again so he had the crypts built and started the tradition of burying starks down there  and here s the other thing starks are buried  not burned and they are buried with their swords  which brings us to my theory  when the ww take winterfell  every dead stark will rise  not as a wight  but something like lsh they ll remember who they were  take their swords and fight the hordes ,czz8g9y,gameofthrones,television,1455424136.0,Ali_Safdari,78.0,0.0,163,1191,0.0

remember in season 1  tyrion told a story about a peasant girl  tysha  jaime and he had saved  and which he secretely married tywin made jaime admit that it was an act jaime made up so tyrion could have his first woman it ends with tywin making tyrion and the entire garrison rape her  leaving tyrion devastated and convinced no one will ever love him  in the books  when jaime rescues tyrion after the trial by combat  he admits that it was not an act  and that tysha really did love him this leaves tyrion devastated once more  and they depart on very bad terms because of it  even with tyrion falsely admitting to killing joffrey to piss off jaime in fact  while travelling to mereen  tyrion thoughts are often preoccupied with her  as a fun theory to add to this  in braavos there is described by arya a prostitute who makes her costumers marry her for one night it his been theorized that this is in fact tysha ,d01v489,gameofthrones,television,1455630518.0,Alexthegreatbelgian,5.0,0.0,3900,40406,0.0

what if the writers bran stark any mention of jon snow for at least the first episode  i feel like the writers are enjoying themselves at the watchers  pun not intended  expense  teaser 1   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ixi8apisq8i  shows jon snow possibly being taken by bran  jon is still alive the  second teaser   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  omra8nozf2q  shows already dead people  but then adds jon snow to the list  and first impression you start cursing but then you see people who are alive in the show i guess that is the whole idea behind teasers  the teasers do a great job bringing my interest back to game of thrones now back to the discussion back to the begging  what if they emit jon snow from the very first episode and continue the jon snow anger ,460puy,gameofthrones,television,1455595963.0,daveofrepublicofdave,0.0,0.0,10244,2116,0.0
personally  i think they shot themselves in the foot when they staged jon s  death  as the season finale by doing that  they condemned themselves to a year of fans not wondering  if  jon snow would return  but  when  he would return  which makes the cliffhanger an empty threat what s done is done  though  if they held off on a jon snow reveal  his absence at least sinks in a bit and the other storylines are allowed to breathe however  they run the risk of fans saying  when will they hurry up and bring jon snow back  nothing else in the show seems important right now  unfortunately  the show is going to have to do a lot of setup again  because all the storylines reached a climax together and will each need resetting  dany meeting the dothraki  the new dynamic in king s landing  sam in oldtown  bran s return  sansa and theon sorting out their shit   on the other hand  an early jon snow revival would give the season an early rush of momentum  which would counteract the dullness of setting up the other storylines  tl  dr  it s a catch22 whether he comes back sooner or later ,d01poii,gameofthrones,television,1455611601.0,sletrab07,7.0,0.0,1,293,0.0

 in the books  doran  prince of dorne  has a daughter and a son besides trystane the daughter s name is arianne and the son s name is quentyn the daughter is real hbo material  rebellious  overly sexual  gorgeous  cunning  but her whole sideplot seems to have been cut which is why the few things outside of that plot seem to have been moved to ellaria  oberyn s paramour  this is an image of her that grrm likes   http  images6fanpopcomimagephotos33200000asoiafasongoficeandfire3326759115002000jpg   also  since dorne is a little more egalitarian than the rest of westeros  she is the heir  as she is older than both trystane and quentyn   in the books  gendry flirst with a barmaid and arya gets a little jealous the barmaid claims to be a bastard of king robert arya admits that she does have the king s black curly hair  but argues that lots of people have that hair  like for example gendry  who we of course know is a bastard of robert    he does nt    grrm likes incest i guess   maester aemon s little brother  aegon  who is dany s grandfather in the show  greatgrandfather in the books  they cut out a generation   aka the father of the mad king  was kind of a middle ages socialist who tried to take power away from the lords and give it to the people obviously the lords were nt thrilled he had been a squire to a humble knight in his youth because his father the fourth son of the king and aegon was the fourth son of the fourth son  so no one expected him to inherit a plague  some vows  and some good old fashioned targaryen madness made him king because of this he is called aegon the unlikely he became obsessed with dragons and tried to hatch some dragon eggs thinking that if he had the ultimate power  he could overcome the lords  but something went wrong and everyone who was there died except dany s parents  the mad king and his sisterwife   grrm really does like incest   dany s mother was heavily pregnant and gave birth that day  to prince rhaegar targaryen  the man who robert killed for taking lyanna stark  ned s sister   in the books  dany and tyrion still have nt met   in the books  jon and arya and ned  and lyanna  all look a lot alike  and cat and her other children all look like tullys  red hair  blue eyes   this is an additional reason why cat hates jon  he s the only boy who really looks like ned   everyone is related once you look at family trees dany s grandfather aegon the unlikely  mentioned above  married someone from the blackwood family ned stark s great grandmother was also a blackwood so ned and dany share blood jorah mormont married the sister of sam tarly s mother robert s dad and dany s dad were cousins ,d01e5o8,gameofthrones,television,1455587884.0,rhollrbackgirl,23.0,0.0,964,3411,0.0

no doubt stannis would be crushed in the field renly would siege king s landing and realize how piss poor the garrison is  and would take the city in no time  stannis would be grining his teeth on dragonstone while tywin s head is spiked by robb in the west renly would no doubt return sansa to robb as a gesture of good faith  and arya would in time make it to riverrun to reunite with her family  hoping she escapes harrenhall in one piece  so pretty much if renly lived  good guys win  most likely i mean  anything  could  happen  like magic shadowbabies  which actually did happen that absolutely no one could have ever predicted  ,d01x18t,gameofthrones,television,1455634383.0,Sommern,2.0,0.0,1100,45933,0.0
my take is renly would ve won a resounding tactical victory  but i do nt think he could ve sealed the strategic deal stannis probably escapes back to dragonstone and keeps his navy  or at least the ships  or at least most of them   since he d still be able to harry the south  renly ca nt attack king s landing  as that would expose his back the war of five kings lasts a lot longer as nobody s really in a position to attack anyone  with the exception of robb stark being left all but alone against tywin  the good news is  that also means the red wedding never happens  ramsay recaptures winterfell and that whole war plays out about the same  and roose has to capitalize on that with robb rather than with tywin ,d01eeci,gameofthrones,television,1455588255.0,sielingfan,0.0,0.0,9108,66632,0.0
not only did renly have the numbers but he also had knits such as loras tyrell and brienne the beauty but he also had randyll tarly who if i remember correctly  one of the best commanders so yes  renly would have won but his forces would have taken a huge hit but probably would have had an even larger navy if saalador saan had gone to renly s cause ,d01cswa,gameofthrones,television,1455585757.0,KHanson25,17.0,0.0,15,3905,0.0

to continue on the theme of ramsay and reek  you may already be aware of this given you came upon some info about reek s torture   ramsay s treatment of his bride is also significantly worse in the books  in the show  ramsay has rather forcible sex with his bride sansa while making reek watch  we d certainly call this marital rape in modern culture  but many have suggested that  in the universe of the show  sansa has to have known that she d have to have sex with ramsay upon marrying him making reek watch was certainly fucked up  but  in the books  ramsay does nt just make reek watch him have sex with his bride  jeyne poole serving as an arya imposter in the books  but he makes reek  prepare  his bride for him by performing cunnilingus on her  honestly when i was watching the episode where sansa marries ramsay  my heart was in my throat dreading the bedroom scene  and i was actually fairly relieved they toned it down significantly ,d01e2we,gameofthrones,television,1455587762.0,Nevermore60,16.0,0.0,20128,92238,0.0

i think it s heavily implied that valyrian steel can kill the white walkers obsidian  or dragon glass  is rock that has been melted by dragon fire it s confirmed that this can kill the white walkers also showing valyrian steel kill a white walker adds to the theory that dragon fire is the key to killing the white walkers as valyrian steel was believed to have been forged in dragon fire so the series is called  a song of ice and fire  so it would make sense that the white walkers  the living embodiment of ice  can be counteredkilled by dragons  the living embodiment of fire  i firmly believe that we are going to see the white walkers breach the wall and move south on westeros the seven kingdoms will unite to try and fight them but they will ultimately fail daenerys will arrive in westeros with her army and dragons however no body will support her because the targaryens left a bad taste in the mouth of westeros however she will ultimately do battle against the white walkers with her dragons and possibly new valyrian steel forged with her dragons and save the 7 kingdoms from the white walkers thus giving her the love and support of the people and a solid claim to the iron throne ,d0297y5,gameofthrones,television,1455651886.0,abomb1231,1.0,0.0,50,72,0.0

personally  i think they shot themselves in the foot when they staged jon s  death  as the season finale by doing that  they condemned themselves to a year of fans not wondering  if  jon snow would return  but  when  he would return  which makes the cliffhanger an empty threat what s done is done  though  if they held off on a jon snow reveal  his absence at least sinks in a bit and the other storylines are allowed to breathe however  they run the risk of fans saying  when will they hurry up and bring jon snow back  nothing else in the show seems important right now  unfortunately  the show is going to have to do a lot of setup again  because all the storylines reached a climax together and will each need resetting  dany meeting the dothraki  the new dynamic in king s landing  sam in oldtown  bran s return  sansa and theon sorting out their shit   on the other hand  an early jon snow revival would give the season an early rush of momentum  which would counteract the dullness of setting up the other storylines  tl  dr  it s a catch22 whether he comes back sooner or later ,d01poii,gameofthrones,television,1455611601.0,sletrab07,7.0,0.0,1,293,0.0

ok i m gon na try to take this family by family  edit  fyi rickard was ned s father  not rodrick starks  sansa  arya  bran  rickon  jon     and jeyne  robb s wife  is pregnant if i m not mistaken this is the main protaganist family and at the very least i expect sansa  bran  as a tree   and rickon to live through our story so their line can continue  tully  the blackfish and edmure are alive and i expect edmure to live why would the freys kill him when they married him into the family blackfish is childless and unmarried but that can change  arryn  this is the one family i do think is probably gon na get wiped out do nt see sweet robin making it harold hardyng is a decedent of the arryn line and he may yet survive but he does nt have the arryn name  baratheon  we know gendry and edric are both still alive i m sure there are other unknown bastards as well all they need is legitimization and i ll add that stannis is nt book dead  and is like the only death ever not shown on tv show deaths tend to be very graphic as soon as it cut away i was like  damn  brienne decided not to do it   so there s a chance he still lives  tyrells  lot of tyrells left mace has like 4 kids  all of whom are still alive if i m not mistaken i do expect mace to die though mace also had a sister marry into the redwynes there is plenty of opportunity for the tyrells to come out of this with the line intact  martells  arianne and trystane are still alive and oberyn has a ton of sand snakes just takes someone to legitimize one of them and the martells are the one family who allows a woman to rule i think they are probably the safest  even if arianne and trystane die  lannisters  kevan lannister has 3 living children if i m not mistaken lancel  prolly dies   martyn  given back by robb stark   and janei the youngest tywin also had a sister named genna who is currently married into house frey i tend to think at minimum martyn lives  targs  dany will make it to the last book but might not live  jon snow     and faegon targs have a high probability of being wiped out  especially if jon and aegon are nt targs  greyjoys  theon  asha  euron  victarion  and aeron at minimum theon has no cock so forget him the uncles are all childless as far as i know i think asha will survive though may be the first women to rule the iron islands if i made any mistakes please let me know,d02j0z6,gameofthrones,television,1455665363.0,MarwyntheMasterful,3.0,0.0,1,213,0.0

  shot 6   http  imgurcom1nl9jel characters  sansa starklannisterbolton  tyrion lannister  daenerys targaryen  cersei lannister  arya stark  jaime lannister state  all alive phrase  none themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

why is it presumed only the faces of the dead are kept there  before she went blind arya saw her own face on another person  as for the significance of  the dead come with it   pointing to the those who are still alive and presumed dead come simply imply that those characters will have an impact on the long nightwhich the inevitable winterdespite their mortality many of the characters  actions echo throughout the realm even after they have died  many other characters have died as well  but the ones shown that have died have had arguably the greatest shifts in the direction of events due to their impact while alive and the shifts that occurred due to their absence  and those still alive are the ones still left to leave their mark and should they fall will have the greatest impact from their absence ,d00exrr,gameofthrones,television,1455518179.0,TracyMorganFreeman,12.0,0.0,1158,160056,0.0
here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit ,d00kqnl,gameofthrones,television,1455539761.0,athze2,13.0,0.0,1,791,0.0
frankly  i m tired of being teased  and this teaser in particular  told us even less than the ones posted to twitter a few weeks back i doubt any of the faces have any significance other than to summarize the big moments throughout the series ned stark s face was there  and we know for a fact  it rotted off his skull atop a spike in king s landing there s no way the faceless men have a copy they need the body to produce one it s why they wash all the sacrifices and drag them off to that chamber ,d00bl5u,gameofthrones,television,1455510296.0,ElvisDepressedIy,29.0,0.0,1,2541,0.0
ultimately i d say that there is no big secret meaning in this trailer remember all men must die so eventually the fm will have these faces regardless of our story i guess if you want to call it foreshadowing or something you can  but i would nt and i d say that all of the people in shot 6 will be dead by the end of book seven  rickon and bran are omitted 1 to carry the stark name  1 to be a tree ,d00dizv,gameofthrones,television,1455514584.0,MarwyntheMasterful,10.0,0.0,1,213,0.0
thats a lot of typing to say very little the idea that jon snow s statement is used to introduce those that will fight the dead is very wishful thinking it s nice to hold on to hope watching this series unfold  but let s be reasonable with it if this trailer is saying anything at all  it is definitely not hopeful i still think there is a slight chance for a happy ending  but i do nt think this teaser is the place to find that i also believe that there is a much greater chance for this series to end in a very tragic manner ,d00bcaq,gameofthrones,television,1455509788.0,glabuz11,48.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies ,45l30b,gameofthrones,television,1455379387.0,stos313,128.0,0.0,77,798,0.0

there could be a certain amount of fuck it just slow them down  going into the headshots in the books  when mormont sends thorne south to king s landing with the dead wight s hand in a jar  he mentions this in the show too   the hand is still alive  and moving for most of thorne s journey by the time he gets to king s landing it s just a dead hand  but when he left castle black  it was solid proof that magic was back in play  anyway what that means  as far as the rules go  is that the brain is nt really in play it s likely some sort of rangebased magic  you never see big hordes of undead moving without white walkers nearby the only way to stop the wights is to stop the walkers ,czylfi8,gameofthrones,television,1455383279.0,sielingfan,37.0,0.0,9108,66632,0.0
white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely decomposes  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them ,czym1ca,gameofthrones,television,1455384334.0,MakingTheEight,32.0,0.0,55,1365,0.0
it s likely that the first wights were cushioning the fall for the ones that fell on them  which would mean less damage for them the fact is  the white walkers have wights to spare  and they seem perfectly happy with sacrificing a few if it means they can get more  it seems that while headshots can work  you have to completely destroy the head  and even then  we ve seen that the limps can remain active  plus  you have to remember  these wights do seem to degrade  so the skeletons are just older  while the fresher wights are more human looking and it seems like for the resurrection to work  the white walkers must be close by we saw the night s king do it with very little effort ,czyjsy5,gameofthrones,television,1455380412.0,Rosebunse,12.0,0.0,40,111531,0.0

the hardest part vs white walkers is how to reduce casualties on yourside while inflecting casulaties on their side for white walkers every wright death is not a loss  only their commanders count your side  every person s death becomes a number on white walker s army  if you happen to lose a few heros  say the hound   they retain their fighting style and now they are like robert strong this makes the battle very difficult ,czyvh3r,gameofthrones,television,1455401050.0,sephelutis,6.0,0.0,1,19,0.0
well with necromancer zombie rules  it seems likely it costs some magical effort to animate the dead  so a walker might abandon a zombie if it s too damaged to be immediately useful especially if there s a thousand others  one zombie  though  in a fight  it would make sense to keep running  even as it s being hacked to bits ,czyq5vh,gameofthrones,television,1455391490.0,Wowzie_Mime,4.0,0.0,1,864,0.0

normal fire doesnt kill the white walkers  only dragon fire i would assume  since valyrian steel and obsidian are rumored to have some kind of dragon magic in them  headshots on the whights are just to slow them down  if they are chopped down to pieces  even if they are still alive  they are not a big threat the wights are the  zombies  and the walkers are the blue guys who are a different species  not undead in regards to essos  we do nt have any record saying they have ever appeared there but if they bring winter with them and not the other way around i would assume that they would eventually reach there,czywsk4,gameofthrones,television,1455403377.0,NSUNDU,1.0,0.0,1,1282,0.0

white walkersothers are definitely vulnerable to valyrian steel and obsidian in hardhome their natural cold seemed to diminish the effects of nearby fire but i suspect that a lot of projectile fire would do the trick people burn the dead bodies to prevent them returning as wights  which are the zombie like creatures that are killed only by fire or severe dismemberment,czzead1,gameofthrones,television,1455439110.0,markusalkemus66,1.0,0.0,1039,5494,0.0
not many rules understood it was discovered by sam that dragon glass kills ww  and dragon class is a result of volcanoes  another name for it obsidian jon was the only who discovered that valerian steel works too  it s knowledge is lost as well but everyone s got an itch that fire or dragons or volcanoes are involved  grrm says he relates valerian steel to damascus steel in real life and that it s knowledge was lost as well among other similarities  minus the magic offcourse  as for wights  aka your zombies  p they are stopped via chopping them into pieces or by fire the ww in hardhome that jon fought extinguished the fire before entering into the big tent  so i doubt fire works on them and i think it was mentioned in many sources it does nt work  except dragon s fire  that should work on both ww and wights as for the headshots  well  i guess they are just missing their headseyes so they are slowed as we saw in bran s battle with the wights  they do nt die or stop completely if you chop off their arms or heads  the two methods are burning or chopping them into many bits  slow them down enough they are nt a threat i guess ,czzg7wd,gameofthrones,television,1455447459.0,spooket,1.0,0.0,1,322,0.0
dragon glass and valerian steel are probably the same thing  at least it s been speculated for a long time that they are and there s enough evidence to assume for now that they are  i do nt think headshots have ever been shown to kill them  just fire and dragon glassvalerian steel there s a theory that valerian steel is forged with dragon fire i think the wildlings aiming for headshots are just doing so out of desperation there s too many for them to actually win so they re just lashing out with what they have available that said  we ve never seen a headless white walker which suggests they ca nt be reanimated it s likely that the magic the others use is similar to those of the red priests and if you remember  when arya asked if they could reanimate someone without a head  poor baby t  t   thoros responsed that they could nt we do nt really know enough to draw a conclusion really i m inclined to believe that if the headsskulls are nt completely destroyed the wights could continue to fight hence why the dead in the north and beyond the wall are burnt and not simply beheaded but i think if they were to just be beheaded then they would nt come back  side note  does anyone else hope that when the others inevitably make it down to winterfell  we ll see white walker brandon  lyanna and rickard    as far as does reanimation only occur during winter  it s the ww who reanimate people  apart from the red priests but that s for another conversation   and it s always winter when they appear  although it s not clear if they create winter and bring it with them or if winter spreads and they follow if it s the former  i d assume that if they were not stopped before reaching dorne  then yes they could also spread to esso  the summer isles and sothoryos ,czzkh1n,gameofthrones,television,1455461397.0,Ash3070,1.0,0.0,3417,1934,1.0
