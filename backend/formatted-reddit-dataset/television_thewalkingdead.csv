it s a show  which means people are stupid because it drives drama a real zombie apocalypse would be over in a month the foe is slow moving and stupid  can not fire ranged weapons and basically has to bite you to beat you simply wearing a leather coat and gloves would help prevent half the bites we have seen instread of running down a street like an unorganized mob  a simple phalanx with shields and lances would clear out the zombie mob immediately a moat outside the walls witha drawbridge would keep zombies out forever and make taking this town impossible for other humans as well  but then where would be the dramatic tension ,d029hxl,thewalkingdead,television,1455652254.0,TrojanDynasty,17.0,0.0,2365,5292,0.0

albeit a 2 hour episode instead of one from top to bottom  it was probably one of the best in the entire series so far in my opinion it covered the broad spectrum of emotions and ended on a semitriumphant note  i told myself for the longest time that i would be fine if everyone died except for rick and carl but after tonight i find myself caring about everyone in rick s new family i know going forward that some or most of them wo nt make it to the series end so this episode would be a perfect ending for me ,460z5u,thewalkingdead,television,1455599880.0,Vivalaredsox,83.0,0.0,1136,12178,0.0

i think daryl would be an interesting choice  and really shock twd fans i love the character  but this would be twd biggest character death in some time hes doing another show on amc next year too  seems interesting  i hope abraham lives for awhile  hes become one of my favorite characters  and i agree  i know hes gone before aow  but how can he not stay on the show for that  hes perfect for a war scenario  especially if daryl gets lucille d again it would suck  but i think if twd killed off daryl it would 1  instantly make the majority of twd fans despise negan and 2  would prove twd has got its balls back ,d02a3vf,thewalkingdead,television,1455653063.0,PeteyG89,6.0,0.0,27,65,0.0

having not read the comics  based on this article i m now predicting   negan is gon na take out either glenn or maggie right away  along with their baby ca nt have two judiths on the show  gt  alternatively  negan could instead straightup kidnap their baby at some point   the one that survives negan s initial encounter will be seriously injured maybe a lost limb or crushed appendage   that one will take negan out in the end on a suicide mission   either daryl or carol will die just get that feeling   if daryl does nt die  he ll be reunited with mr crossbow   if rick and michonne both survive season 6 they ll ship up   if both oneeyed coral and judith survive season 6 i ll be surprised i m impressed they managed to make it this far with a newborn in the first place    edit    neg    e    n not neg    a    n    edit 2    just kidding ,d02aa1o,thewalkingdead,television,1455653298.0,TexasWithADollarsign,11.0,0.0,3867,85201,0.0

i think the michonne character will have a surprising development but i see her sooner as rick s new love interest than as a surprising death think about it andrea is dead maggie has glenn and michonne has been like a mother to carl my guess is that morgan will be killed off the show focusses on his refusal to kill what better way to sacrifice yourself by offering your life  still keep your convictions and teach rick  and maybe carol  a lesson about not having to kill everything,d02g5fc,thewalkingdead,television,1455661128.0,Oriopax,1.0,0.0,548,221,0.0
michonne has been through so much everyone has  i get that  it s the zombie apocalypse and everyone s life has turned to shit but michonne her story really hits hard for me  though i ca nt particularly 100  relate to it  even there s just something so numbing about it she s lost everyone she held dear her boyfriend  best friend  her son and making her boyfriend and best friend into zombie slaves  i always thought that was so badass  but really  it was a thin layer she held onto so she did nt have to completely let go a place of denial when they were  re  killed  she lost it all  i know some others have lost everything  too carol  she lost her husband  though to be honest  good riddance  and her daughter that must hurt  so  bad she s hardened up and i honestly do nt hold that against her  because it s a rational way to react in a world as cold as the one she s living in  it s dangerous to be kind and have an open heart  maggie maggie lost nearly her entire family at the farm  then her dad at the prison and her sister at the hospital i love maggie to death  and the only thing that makes me feel less like she s lost everything  but please stop showing her crying oh my god it hurts my heart  is that she has glenn and you know  we re all speculating that he ll be dead soon  and if he does  should i say when   i m kinda expecting it but i know i ll still be shocked  then she ll have lost everything  ish  depending on where they go with the baby and all   there are other characters but i do nt want to make this longer than it already is michonne is a beautiful  strong character with a tragic past and we ve seen her open up a bit with carl and rick  and some of the others   which has been heartwarming and has given us a way to see more of who she is and how sweet her personality can be despite the hardships she s faced  and if she does die  oh my god i   will   cry it s something we are nt expecting because she s done so well for herself and others the whole time it truly would shock us all to the core  and that s a shock i do nt want to take ,d02r5zs,thewalkingdead,television,1455677978.0,dinolesbo,2.0,0.0,444,416,0.0

okay  so we all hate ron and glad he is dead  but i have a few points on why we should nt be so harsh  he was physically and mentally abused his whole life  and the apocalypse probably made it 10 times worse  rick came in and killed his father  got with his mom  and his son took his girl yes  it may have all been justified  but not to an emotionally ruined teenager  i think many of us would have the same feelings and reactions if we were in his shoes  ron was a tragic figure who s death was guaranteed  but i think we should be a little more rational about him ,464xu4,thewalkingdead,television,1455661074.0,Master_Of_Knowledge,143.0,0.0,49,9303,0.0
well that was brutal  great episode with some very good action sequences  loved the montage of characters just swinging their weapons at the screen  but i must say that carl living is another cliche  so we get 3 simultaneous deaths of the anderson family getting eaten alive  and one amazingly satisfying stabbing  and yet conveniently carl lives after receiving a bullet to the eye  have a word with yourselves writers  i m not saying it s impossible or implausible because it is nt but why save all of the major characters in this crazy zombieriddled episode  have some balls it s ironic that morgan is getting more annoying and gabriel is getting more tolerable  bad writing  or is morgan just a complete wank stain   even after his amazing centricepisode  this should have been the midseason finale because the one we got was terrible  but i know why it was nt because there was nt a cliffhanger to lead us into the rest of the season  i still do nt understand why so many people hate rick though  he is bad ass  and actually has evolved over the years 810  carl living brought it down ,d016vxg,thewalkingdead,television,1455576347.0,MarkWatson12,1.0,0.0,1,25,0.0

absolutely  everyone who s quick to call this the best episode ever is just happy that the show decided to do some action for once all of the fan favorite episodes have been like that  just like the opener to season 5 and the end to season 2  3  and 4 there were multiple mistakes in the directing  most notably being the  day night transition  the ignoring of last seasons cliffhanger  the whole maggie situation the show is really going downhill in quality  every season has been the same thing opening episode is amazing  mid season finale is amazing then the mid season premiere is amazing and the season finale is amazing in between we have two half decent episodes and then all filler this combined with how unnatural the dialogue is now is turning off a lot of viewers  for me personally  glenn has pissed me off to no end they have great ideas but just ca nt execute well glenn s fall into the horde was shot terribly and did nt respect the continuity of the previous shot  his survival at terminus was bs  his survival in the woods in the finale last season  his survival tonight by literally the biggest stretch of the entire show so far  i love these characters and the world they re in  but the writing and directing needs to improve if they want this show to last clearly the fans will continue watching  but critically i m predicting a large decline as the seasons pass i still love the show  but mistakes and decisions like these are ruining the experience ,d02me20,thewalkingdead,television,1455670629.0,Agastopia,-9.0,0.0,11682,55551,1.0

the whole change seemed forced in order to off the wolf character  which easily could have been done just by denise pushing him as they walked or something similar  alternatively  i would have been fine with the change if there had been any indication previously that the wolf was conflicted but there really was nt and he came across as an entirely despicable human being until he was nt kind of did a complete 180 with no particular reason other than  this terrified woman i ve just met is kinda cute so i m going to go back and save her now  which comes completely out of left field for this violent psychopathic individual  my other thought was that he was prepared to risk himself to save her because she was a doctor  but did nt denise already patch up and sew his wound back together  i m not sure if he s escaping over the wall that keeping her around would have improved his survival chances all that much since they did nt have antibiotics on them ,d01vb6f,thewalkingdead,television,1455630944.0,McL0v1N42,3.0,0.0,1611,3725,0.0

people were pointing out that a car appeared in the background of    s  negan s   gang right before the explosion nicotero on talking dead said they did a real explosion with fake dummies meaning they had to cut  remove the actor  put the dummy in there place line everything up and set off the explosion setup like this would take a very long time and enough time for someone to notice a car parked in frame this means it was really big error or it was intentional  if the gang was blown to bits  there would be no way for    s  negan   to know what happened to his gang    f  without a look out vehicle  he would know what happened and who to punish   the look out vehicle probably followed darryl to alexandria and then left to report back to    s  negan    all speculation at this point  of course,d00zvq8,thewalkingdead,television,1455566071.0,l_Banned_l,13.0,0.0,4725,18557,0.0

no if he had actually changed he would nt have forced denise to try and run for the wall when she was attacked he did nt help to be a nice person he only went back to save her because he needed her  she dies and he dies of his infection the only decent thing he ever does is after he s stabbed  bitten  and shot in the chest that was nt change that was  i m dead anyways ,d01kk7y,thewalkingdead,television,1455598333.0,slowsupra,17.0,0.0,394,49754,0.0
yes morgan changed him he could have made it out on his own but wants to bring denise he engages with her on a human level  you do nt have to scared  is nt something an ordinary wolf says to people compare the way he spoke to morgan and denise earlier  i m going to kill you i m going back o take all your shit you re already dead  amp  etc it s clear they intended to convey that morgan s  and eastmans  methods actually can work ,d01ktdp,thewalkingdead,television,1455598833.0,fatfrost,9.0,0.0,40,13510,0.0

you do nt get to come back from the things that he and the rest of the wolves committed  but for the little time he had left after getting bit he had some redemption but that s like saying the governor changed during his arc with that family and how he did nice things for them still pure evil in the end if the wolf survived the episode  there is no chance rick and the gang lets him live  let alone join their group ,d0202hl,thewalkingdead,television,1455639287.0,pethcir,2.0,0.0,10383,24477,0.0
i do nt know and i think that s the point  there s always room for speculation but i like how abruptly it was cut short thanks to carol who knows what would have happened when they got to the infirmary  it s all for naught because carol kills without asking questions it helps highlight the feud between her and morgan and their outlooks on life  and shows that carol s  shoot first  talk later  mentality is arguably just as detrimental as morgan s desire to not kill at all ,d029x65,thewalkingdead,television,1455652816.0,nickbrick23,2.0,0.0,1,13104,0.0
yeshe did changedif he was the same psychopathic wolf he would not have shoved the walker to save denise but instead would have pushed the walker to denise to kill her as the wolf probably have the  if im going to diei ll probably take a few more alexandrians with me  mentalityhowever he sacrificed himself to save denise which means morgan really changed him,d01m9kp,thewalkingdead,television,1455601871.0,sloth_bear12,18.0,0.0,1,57,0.0

this is why i ve come back to watching it right after it records on my dvr  it s sad how clueless some news outlets are about how online media works both title and opening sentences are fair game for aggregating and deep links  like facebook   examples of other headlineslead i ve seen include  shocker  this character is still alive  last night we learned this character was the killer all along  after many red herrings  how did this show keep this character s illness a secret  not dead yet  this character s actor just showed up on set it s like they live in an alternate world where the concept of spoiler tag never existed ,d00x70t,thewalkingdead,television,1455562232.0,_rgx,16.0,0.0,6,5782,0.0
i mean he was right about the wolf dude he could have left denise to die when he s running to the tower to escape also he chose to take out some zombies to give her the chance to escape  even after being shot twice by carol i feel like that s a big plot point from this last episode i have nt seen much discussion about ,462w55,thewalkingdead,television,1455636279.0,Howdy15,204.0,0.0,20,37,0.0
i think the whole idea is that both morgan and carol are facing their ideals and figuring out they are wrong they re challenging each other with their opposing viewpoints and are both independently coming to the conclusion that their belief system does nt work as much as they would like to think ,d022eoa,thewalkingdead,television,1455642637.0,QuasarKid,14.0,0.0,98,2979,0.0

if you mean in the story itself  it will be interesting to see if denise talks about what happened she obviously believed his change to be genuine carol and morgan will just assume based on their last bit of evidence and carol surely thought she was saving her when she shot him ,d024f5x,thewalkingdead,television,1455645404.0,_rgx,2.0,0.0,6,5782,0.0
nobody is right or wrong because there is a huge grey area here it lands on a series of ifs and buts like denise would nt have even been outside in the walker herd if wolf did nt take her out there at gun point then again she may have died if he did nt come back for her  intentions or not although he did save denise at the end by tackling a walker while dying  morgan took a huge fuckin  risk by keeping someone who openly threatened to murder his group multiple times carol fucked up too because she could see them running together  not at gun point anymore  and she shot him anyways because thats what she thought had to be done no matter what she only realized after that maybe she did nt have to in that moment so this situation  even though caused by morgan  lands on both of them and i hope they go more in depth to the consequences of what happened ,d025p62,thewalkingdead,television,1455647146.0,motleycruejew,2.0,0.0,10478,4969,0.0

in the world of the walking dead people have finally realized that they need walls to keep out the dead and other enemies just like centuries ago however  they are still forgetting one critical component a citadelkeep  castles  and other walled fortresses would always have a citadel for people to fall back if the outer walls were ever breached given the latest incident in alexandria why did the powers that be ever build a citadel for everyone to fall back if the walls were ever compromised ,463yho,thewalkingdead,television,1455649004.0,CCV21,37.0,0.0,1473,5348,0.0

not even the wolf understands his own motives he s confused  the ladder was clear i could have left but i came back for you   not verbatim   when you re faced with fight or flight  it s pure instinct but the motive is still a mystery i thought the wolf was going to use denise as bait to draw the walkers away but then he went back for her did he save her because he changed  or did he save her to use her later  she s proven herself to help with medical situations  did he save her because he wanted to turn her into a wolf  if he really did have a change of heart  why was he still running  he could have gone back to morgan and said  ok  i ve changed  and morgan would have welcomed him  we ll never know his true intentions but we also can look at this as the intense struggle every character has on this show why do they do the things they do  some intentions may seem obvious but there are alternate motivators behind the scenes too the end of the world brings out the best and worst out of our dearly beloved characters ,d02b6t2,thewalkingdead,television,1455654505.0,diiskoo,1.0,0.0,1,11168,0.0
if you want us to admit that the wolf can be redeemed  and therefore  morgan is right   then you also have to admit that lizzie could have been redeemed i do nt think it s an easy job to be jury  judge  and executioner we ll see what morgan thinks ifwhen he meets negan ,d02bxaz,thewalkingdead,television,1455655452.0,sarcazm,1.0,0.0,375,12850,0.0

funny how that wolf goes from hacking people apart to saving people in less than a day that felt forced as shit  but no  it does nt make morgan ostensibly right it does nt make carol ostensibly wrong it makes the both of them have good and bad points  and they both serve the purpose of leading rick to his final conclusion in all out war,d02i6iq,thewalkingdead,television,1455664062.0,layorz,1.0,0.0,793,31688,0.0

i do nt know if this has been talked about but i know everyone loved this episode from what i can tell i thought it was awesome  tons of deaths and awesome battle scenes  however  i am also nervous for the rest of the season twd has been known to give us one great amazing episode to reel us in and then give us mediocrity for the remainder of the season  i also was nt a fan of every single character seemingly having long monologues it all seemed a little ridiculous  also  as another thread mentioned there were so many laughable moments like glenn surviving  again  with what seemed like sasha and abraham spraying bullets directly at him and the walkers  the catwalk thing and maggie  the rocket launcher that non one saw coming  etc  i just feel like this was it  they just blew their load for this half of the season and the rest will be a letdown ,463wbz,thewalkingdead,television,1455648297.0,wordswiththeletterB,0.0,0.0,69,1199,0.0

i feel he was right just not anymore  after witnessing how crazy people have become it s past that point now that he has witnessed it in fullscale his philosophy was one of the last remnants of humanity before the outbreak which is a whole book in itself if we were to talk about it i mean it s not that easy to choose to kill someone  or is it  and i think that s his personal grudge against carol back then  and how he reacted about rick changing  how easy it was for them to just kill ,d0285t1,thewalkingdead,television,1455650469.0,VS0P,1.0,0.0,1,139,0.0
morgan could ve very easily been  wrong  though point is  that could ve easily gotten carol  himself  denise  rosita  tara and eugene killed why  so that one guy  may  become better sure  he did  but that risk very nearly got denise killed  and certainly would ve done if he d been wrong if rick had made the choice in the bar in season 2  him and glenn would both be dead  and hershel would ve died sooner if rick had made that choice with shane  he d be dead if deanna had nt made that choice with pete  reg would still be alive the list goes on letting people live may sometimes lead to nobody dying  but the vast majority of the time  it just gets somebody else killed later ,d0227gx,thewalkingdead,television,1455642352.0,shit-I-justfuckedup,5.0,0.0,2110,2624,0.0
i do nt believe morgan was right in letting the wolf live remember  he could have killed the wolf multiple times  starting with when the wolf and his buddy confronted morgan at his camp  prior to saving daryl and aaron and getting to alexandria but he let both wolves live  had he finished them  we might have not seen the wolves drive the truck into the wall at alexandria causing all this chaos that ensued thereafter the migrating of walkers from the quarry may have gone according to plan  with no horn to attract them  as much as i love carol  i do nt agree with her methods all the time there needs to be compromise between her view and morgan s to survive in this world but it makes me upset to think that morgan is honoring the beliefs of his mentor eastman by imposing those beliefs on the rest of the group thus  risking the lives of those around him not just his own eastman was really only taking a chance with his own life  and tabitha s  when he let morgan live but morgan is playing with fire  making decisions that affect more people than just himself  morgan does nt want to kill anymore because of his self awakening  leaving everyone at risk at least carol is willing to kill anyone in order to save those she loves when i think about morgan  it s quite selfish of him if you ask me ,d02macy,thewalkingdead,television,1455670468.0,ana_BANANAS,1.0,0.0,35,1773,0.0
morgan was right  but his method was wrong  denise is what really swayed him  people who change can change again morgan is just terrible with his execution whats his face had morgan in a cage  morgan was stupid for not trying to open to door and led himself to believe it was locked this wolf was not fooled by anything and just waiting for his moment he knew that escaping early on was pointless ,d02pbmf,thewalkingdead,television,1455675101.0,KiNGofKiNG89,1.0,0.0,1,18477,0.0
i do nt think it s so black and white absolutely carol was in the wrong because she s too absolute on how she views people  and the wolf s actions after he s shot definitely illustrates this but morgan s actions initially put denise in danger  and when he wakes up he realizes that too   jss  covered both of their flawed outlooks very well both characters are capable of fending of the attackers  but both of their outlooks are extremely absolute carol s definitely left less loose ends  but she s sacrificing her morality  as evidenced by how she treats sam earlier on the shot of them going opposite ways on the road really showed  not only their differences  but how far gone both of them are ,d01ym0j,thewalkingdead,television,1455637057.0,Day5225,18.0,0.0,1150,31217,0.0

meet their end in the season finale   1 daryl this is the most obvious for me  with daryl now being the one who killed negan s scouting party  the symbolism of the blood on his wings  and the promise that we ll see more of him this second half norman reedus is also getting more and more movie deals  so i m sure his time is up he s been the fan favorite for nearly 5 years  and i m sure the writers  gimple  and kirkman have been cooking this up for a while  which may be the biggest blow to the show since hershel s death   2 glenn part of me prefers him to die  as it would have the most impact storywise  and  given the context of the comics  it s possibly the single greatestmost horrifying introduction to a villain in comic book history  but i feel like they re only teasing him dying and being saved at the last minute just to trick all the comic readers into being set in their expectations i think that they think that we think it s the most obvious thing to do  and most people expect to see that on their screens  but  they do nt want to follow the comics exactly in this case  which leads into   3 morgan this is the most interesting choice for me there s some  morgan sacrifices himself in place of x   theories  which i feel would lend some great kudos to the writers  but  i do nt think would work out at all  given the villain we re expecting it would make sense for morgan to beg and plead for him to die instead  as he has no real family left  and many of the group have been having major trouble with him  even though in s6e09 he claims to finally have realized what he now needs to do in order to stay in the group   it would be the ultimate sacrifice  but i do nt think negan would have any of that shit he is nt emotional  forgiving  or really logical in most cases  so i highly doubt he d just go  oh  yeah  sorry about that  x   i ll take this guy instead bring him up   4 spencer i do nt think he ll be present when negan shows up  but i feel like it would be similar to my morgan scenario spencer has no family anymore and does nt have any significant other that we know of in alexandria the only reason why i even put him in on the list  really low  at that  is because he is nt a major character in any way  and is more likely a candidate for his comic death   5 abraham this is the one i doubt the most kirkman himself has said that he regrets killing him off so early  and that he wishes he would have been around for the allout war arc  so i feel like he wo nt be getting the arrow death nor meet lucille anytime soon i expect him to be gone by the end of the show s adaptation of the allout war arc  maybe as the season 7 finale or season 8 midseason finale  anywhere between season 7 and 9  really ,463uvf,thewalkingdead,television,1455647828.0,imightbeidioteque,12.0,0.0,64,1301,0.0

i think the point was supposed to be that she was stuck up there with a swarm of walkers underneath her and no easy way to get down without injury or getting eaten if you are stuck somewhere for hours  are you going to choose to stay on the larger platform with railings and room to sitlay down  and a better vantage point of your surroundings  or are you going to choose to stand on a skinny metal railing with no handholds  enid s purpose was to fashion together some kind of rope using the church crap so they could climb down the other side of the wall where presumably there were few or no zombies and they would have a better chance to escape  i ca nt remember if maggie got hurt or not before she got up there  but it sounds like from some comments she was  so again  it makes more sense for her to stay where there s at least a railing and room to hang out  if the platform was really about to collapse  maggie would have obviously gone onto the metal thing  or if there was no other option  jumped over the wall and probably broken some bones  which would probably have ended up killing her eventually as she d not be able to runfight off walkers so it made more sense for her to stay put until the horde had passed an injury can mean death in this world  as evidenced by that stupid girl a few episodes back who twisted her ankle and got eaten later that episode when they were trying to draw the horde to the quarry  the whole thing with the horde making the platform shake and glenn panicking was just drama for the sake of tv and yes  that was dumb  but it made for a more exciting scene than maggie calmly dragging herself on to the metal thing and laying down until the situation was sorted  as for getting up and killing zombies later if she was injured  maybe that s lazy writing  or maybe her injury was nt that bad  or it was just adrenaline kicking in  there s been dumber things on this show than this metal railingplatform thing so it did nt bother me much ,d024jfn,thewalkingdead,television,1455645565.0,gettingzen,5.0,0.0,257,1766,0.0

when he offered to take judith back to the church  i agree with you  i didnt trust him at first but  seeing him walk away from the group with her and he just slowly shuffle towards the church it made sense that rick let him take her before rick and co met him at his church  and even up to his big speech  gabriel hasnt killed anyone he survived by moving around them too yes he had a lot of food in his church  but he also did some recon around the area and knew where food was and was not as risky as it was  next to rick and michonne  he has the most experience creeping around the dead undetected i also dont think gabriel hates rick  but hates that rick hates him it was his time to help out after all rick and co has done for him ,d02aw4a,thewalkingdead,television,1455654118.0,1800jerkstore,3.0,0.0,1,48,0.0

i love this show  but there is a lot of shit in this show that drives me bananas just like this   nobody ever wears any kind of armor just a leather jacket would give  some  sort of protection from bites and most of the time when people get bit its on the arm  and while they re doing something stupid like tyrese  he was just staring at a picture on the wall  i assume thinking  twins  twins  twins  what does it mean  twins there are 2 of them   at which time he gets bit on the arm at this point they should be clearing areas  armed and with proper armor  before they go sightseeing   they  should  be trying to be quiet when the zeds are close  but instead have entire conversations when they re  right in the middle of a fucking horde of zombies   and rick is the loudest of them all   and if zombie guts covered clothing makes them virtually invisible to the zeds  then why are nt they calmly slaying them by the hundred wearing zombie guts covered armor and using spears   somehow  the second someone becomes a zombie in this show  their skull turns into paper mach  and you can just easily slide a knife in there and magically hit that  one spot  that turns them off like a light switch people who die and return as a zombie 2 minutes later are also somehow rotten and their clothing is automatically all fucked up   this show is based on the romero zombie moviesworld  and in those movies  zombies  like everything on this planet  are  afraid  of fire but in this show  and seemingly only when they need it to the zombies are attracted to fire and will stupidly just walk right into it and stand there until they burn up   it s been several years since the apocalypse has taken over  yet every time they find a vehicle is miraculously full of good gasoline and the keys are in the ignition   daryl dixon rides the loudest vehicle you can find  to be a stealthy tracking ranger type with a silent crossbow   everyone is a headshot master  whether they ve ever held a gun before or not   no one ever uses any spears    that baby should be dead   all guns have unlimited ammo until the plot demands them to be out   people put themselves in dangerous situations that there is absolutely no reason to do so   characters are either good or evil  there is no in between you re either a murderous  abusive  snarky asshole whose bent on the destruction of the group  or you re part of the goody two shoes group there are no grey areas  etc ,d027v0a,thewalkingdead,television,1455650063.0,DoctorDeath,3.0,0.0,15402,120183,0.0

i still say it s not on purpose you guys are looking at 24  monitors or larger screen tvs  the camera operator is aiming though a viewfinder  which is high definition but certainly small the cinimatographer is likely looking at a lower resolution live monitor  the director probably never looked at the shot live and just watched it a few times on the monitor  they would nt notice it on the screen they might have noticed it in real life but with pyro and practical effects they were very likley 100 or so meters back from the scene and did nt have the vantage over the slight crest hill that we do with the camera,d01fgtn,thewalkingdead,television,1455589930.0,xscamerashyy,2.0,0.0,151,3972,0.0

i ve got a feeling we ll be dissecting and discussing this till the season finale  though you raise a really good point the time it would take to replace the actors with dummies would have clearly been enough time to notice a car in the background and ask whoever owned the car to move it honestly thinking it through now it s probably intentional because  spoiler    f  negan has to learn somehow about the killing    and it s not likely that one of the bikers survived a rpg ,d01008s,thewalkingdead,television,1455566257.0,walterdog12,3.0,0.0,1,18471,0.0

that was the biggest stretch for me  of this episode daryl can shoot a rocket from behind the truck in direct sightline and the biker guys do nt see it  it can go from afternoon to pitch black darkness in 30 seconds  walkers can go from easily pushable to swift and deadly depending on the shot  doctor lady can go from knowing nothing to fixing carl s exploded head  glenn can literally be covered with biting walkers and survive all of this can happen  but as soon as i saw that fucking catwalk i was like what no you ca nt get away with that it s too much to ask for  edit  sweet merciful hell  what i m saying is that all of those things happened were at least unlikely to occur and at worst hilariously inconsistent and i was aok with it with the exception of that god forsaken metal cat walk that they hid from view until the very last moment to reveal that maggie was actually going to be fine but momentarily wrote her to be an idiot because  suspense  and thus glenn put his life in danger unnecessarily again  do nt even talk to me about the couch on the fire escape   the episode is one of my favourites of the whole series  they pulled off one of the most iconic comic scenes and i am giddy for the next arc  which is where i think the series is going to climax in a big way ,d01hqyo,thewalkingdead,television,1455593536.0,Katalina_Rogue,1293.0,0.0,1,1738,0.0

i said it in another thread  but i m gon na say it here too  gabriel was phenomenal in this episode the actor really put in an amazing performance  and gabriel s character shift is really quite satisfying to watch  i was listening to a podcast where they were discussing the meaning of the bible verse on the wall in the church  and the podcasters were relating it to enid  because she was the one in shot with the verse   but i was thinking  no  it s about gabriel   gabriel finally understands now that his faith is meaningless if he wo nt act god does nt save you by a miracle  you save yourself by having faith in yourself and in god faith without works is dead  it was perfect  now i m worried gabriel s going to get eaten i really hope they do nt  the character really has some great opportunities to grow i really hope they do nt pull their tired trope of  give a character some extra lines  have them go through a major change  just so that we can immediately kill him for cheap emotional value  ,d02a927,thewalkingdead,television,1455653263.0,FalconGK81,2.0,0.0,33,5504,0.0
