gt  the series was a huge sensation despite the fact that nothing beyond the first season aired on american television until later the pause was due primarily to censorship issues  cartoons were seen purely as a children  s medium whose audience  according to american broadcasters  could not comprehend advanced concepts such as death or deal with excessive onscreen violence tezuka was personally approached and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this changed even a bit in the last  half a century  we see the same shit even today  and this is too short  i want more  ca nt wait for the next part  we will get into a more familiar territory for us and hopefully we can pick up a show or two from that period ,anime,entertainment,1455634221.0,11.0,0.0,24966.0,114769.0,0.0

if you read a lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things  check out this anime you ll like what you find  i m martinthedragon  and i thank you for reading ,anime,entertainment,1455658733.0,117.0,0.0,1026.0,699.0,0.0

holy fuck what an ending  amuro and char s duel was intense with both their mechs being destroyed kind of sad that the white base was destroyed i was not expecting char to blow off kycilia s head off this episode i was kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing series and i ll look forward to watching zeta gundam with you all ,anime,entertainment,1455661388.0,3.0,0.0,413.0,17147.0,0.0
i like how amuro casually abandons his favorite gundam when it becomes half useless it s just a robot afterall  i remember he operates the console to set autopilot for the last shooting  but it s not there might be movie or manga addition  amuro notices that zabi is the true enemy  but it s different from char s standpoint amuro is still talking like just a soldier hoping piece  whilst char s motivation is mostly from his personal revenge and he also now finds newtypes are more dangerous  to whom  whole humanity  or himself   so it s understandable they ca nt reconcile and join  the episode title escape is appropriate  besides amuro wanted to confront char clues in white base just fight to survive and escape from a baoa qu alive they are now federation soldier but still have civilian mindset from episode 1  overall i see the last few episodes feeling rushed  but do nt find its openendingness is unsatisfying or i say it is not an open ending  considering the scope of the story is one year war amuro survived the war along with the members of white base  char completed his revenge it is a good conclusion ,anime,entertainment,1455673446.0,3.0,0.0,1848.0,4313.0,0.0

he wrote the script himself  i m wary of anything todd mcfarlane writes after his interview with the comics journal  mcfarlane  yeah  i  m  uh  i just don  t  i  you got me pinned in the corner here  because i don  t read  and you  re right  it is kind of funny that i  m a writer you know what i mean  groth  yeah  mcfarlane  more than that  though  it  s kind of frustrating to writers out there  groth  or irksome  mcfarlane  because  then  either it doesn  t really fucking matter what people write  then  because if i can do it  and i can sell 1000000 copies with bad writing  then what the fuck is the problem  that brings us to the argument  then  that maybe the artwork is more important  that  s a whole  nother discussion then  at that point  groth  or maybe most comicbook readers don  t care about the writing  mcfarlane  then i  m going   ok  they don  t care about the writing  perfect then  it  s a good thing that i  m a better artist than writer right now  then  i mean  the fates are looking down on me even when i don  t try  i seem to somehow succeed i  m ignorant on a lot of things  but i think that i  m somewhat wellbalanced in life  such that i  ve been thrown into a kind of a fame and fortune  i  m a fuck  let me tell you about it  but you know what  the kids never see that side of me when i  m in front of the kids  because they  re the most important thing to me  i  m a pussycat i owe my life to every single one of those kids that buys my book i don  t care if they  re 8 or 28  or 88 it  s the readers that i owe everything to i don  t give a shit about the fucking other people that are along the chain they exist because  ultimately  because of those kids the distributors can think that they  re doing something that  s grand and whatever else  and they are  but they wouldn  t even exist if people didn  t want comic books the retailers are doing a great job and i love them but they wouldn  t be selling comic books if the kid didn  t want to buy comic books now  somewhere down the line those kids are buying the comic books  so when they react to my stuff  and i read my mail  if i make any changes  it  s from the fan mail   i think  todd  that this character  s a little bit too dark and morose for us  i think he  s too happy  i think he  s too fat  i think he  s too wide   i react to those kids  because they  re my buying public editorial people  or anybody else along the way says   todd  don  t make them fat   why   just because  that  s not a good enough answer to me right now in my life the kids  unfortunately  when they  re sitting there going   he  s too fat  because he looks like a little lump of    they  ve actually got a reason why they think he  s too fat nobody else along the chain has it  so  i  ve been thrust in a position where i can either be a fuck or an ignoramus i can play any game that anybody wants me to play i think that i can play them  somewhat  with whatever skill that i have i should have been an actor i think i perform very well but i also know that i  m not good at everything that i do i  m better at other things but i don  t think that  just because i  m not good at somethings  that i  m not good at being a writer  that i should have a better writer on my book  groth  but if you respect writing  and you respect your audience  wouldn  t you try to make yourself a better writer  mcfarlane  uhhuh  groth  but you don  t read anything  mcfarlane  no  i don  t read anything  groth  so how can you make yourself a better writer if you don  t study writing and read other authors  mcfarlane  maybe there  s my ignorance there  because i don  t think that if i read shakespeare i  m going to become a good comicbook writer  groth  well  i don  t either  resigned   mcfarlane  i don  t know what you want me to read i mean  if it  s technical stuff  you  re going to have a tough time  because unless it  s got pictures  i can  t read black and white  other than the box scores i just don  t have that mentality i  ve got to have pictures in front of me i don  t read comics  i don  t read nothing really i read the sports page  and then the comics journal  i  m going to give you a plug actually  that  s black and white i do read that and whatever else it  s not like i don  t have somewhat of a mild vocabulary out there ,comicbooks,entertainment,1455556499.0,11.0,0.0,46.0,9931.0,0.0

first  i ll start by saying that this is not the case the implication is that bruce basically abused him mentally and dick lost his mind because of it  but there s nothing sexual about their relationship  second  i d like to address this  gt  i d like to separate his political views from his fiction this is extremely difficult to do with miller  especially in any work of his that was createdpublished in the years following 911  he is by nature a very political artist who infuses his stories with his own personal opinions on politics and society  and dksa is one of his most angry political pieces to date  he was writing it when 911 happened  and you can tell that it takes an extremely sharp turn towards rightwing  libertarian politics around halfway through  as far as i m concerned  tdksa is one of the worst batman stories there is because it s barely even a batman story it just reads like miller using batman to act out his violent  anarchofascist fantasies  stay the fuck away from it if you have problems with miller s particular brand of hateful  racist politics ,comicbooks,entertainment,1455620742.0,7.0,0.0,2108.0,69724.0,1.0
as a fan of miller s precrazy era  and a huge fan of batman  i ve avoided this book like the plague  among many of his later works  due to his strong conservative views i d like to separate his political views from his fiction  and it has made semirecent works more tolerable  but i have heard one certain thing that makes me want to forget this exists  bruce molests dick grayson is this just a rumor  is it alluded to  heavily implied  or a common misconception  any and all input is appreciated thanks ,comicbooks,entertainment,1455600308.0,14.0,0.0,211.0,270.0,0.0

i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455581228.0,6.0,0.0,123.0,4165.0,0.0

in regard to your comment about being unable to learn parseltongue  i think it is possible to animal languages at least to be understood by those who are not natural speakers  dumbledore himself understands parseltongue   i d think owl language would be the most useful in the wizarding world it s so natural for owls to be seen about  so they d make the perfect observers and spies ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455638996.0,4.0,0.0,107.0,8262.0,0.0
the top comment in this  thread   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments440ppydid_dumbledore_speak_parseltongueczmh7bn  suggests that parseltongues could be magically attenuated to speaking to snakes  however elsewhere on this reddit and i believe jkr herself said it can not be learned we know genetics  of sorts  plays into it some  so are there natural felinetongues  aviriatoungues  rodentiatongues that we do nt know about out there  of course i m asking for wild speculation here as the canon does nt talk about it much and seems to keep parseltongues on par with voldy so no character wants to explore it in the books for fear of being named a deatheater or whatever irrational nonsense comes to mind ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455630797.0,35.0,0.0,4977.0,5879.0,0.0

all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560441.0,4.0,0.0,50.0,34365.0,0.0

1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had become toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559577.0,2.0,0.0,5956.0,33693.0,1.0

yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  welcome to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455554443.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,27.0,0.0

it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455568927.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,20037.0,0.0

interesting read i would think that it could be argued that snape and pettigrew were in those house because that s where they wanted to be and not necessarily where they ought to be and the same can be said for other students  remember that the sorting hat takes people s opinion or want into consideration  i would think that s why most people are sorted into houses based on where they re relatives were ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455651496.0,1.0,0.0,34.0,5128.0,0.0

i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with voldemort for a year he could ve easily abandoned himchopped off his right handkill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escapei mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and recklessnot just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuffnot with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministryalthough i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would ve been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time lowvoldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would ve been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrewthe same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human  the world is nt split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gives them depth  5  bonus  i think voldemort would ve made a good gryffindor  his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald,harrypotter,entertainment,1455594420.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,170.0,0.0

i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you  it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat  harry would have been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7  the hat goes with your choice above all other aspects it weighs in so whoever your 11yearold self believes he or she is or should be  that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i love how it is demonstrated in the movie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride  and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end  i really believe that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455661009.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
seems like the sorting hat has a pretty clear algorithm  1  you a dick  yes  slytherin  no  2  you brave  yes  gryffindor  no  3  you smart  yes  ravenclaw  no  hufflepuff  case studies  malfoy dick  yup does nt matter that he s smart  he fixed the vanishing cabinet  props for that   hermione dick  nope brave  yup does nt matter that she s brilliant  she gets gryffindor   harry dick  apparently enough to confuse the hat  but borderline brave  alright  gryffindor  counterpoints  cedric seems not a dick  brave and smart  which would put him in gryffindor  so to answer your question  cedric obvious algorithm malfunction ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455595308.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1374.0,0.0

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments45xv8mchapter_by_chapter_61_the_other_minister    synopsis   bellatrix and narcissa arrive at snape s house narcissa wants to talk to him bella is trying to stop her she thinks snape is a traitor they arrive at his door and snape welcomes them in snape bullies wormtail a bit then bellatrix questions snape about whose side he is on he is able to explain away all her questions then narcissa has a chance to air her worry draco has been given a task by the dark lord narcissa thinks he ll die in the attempt she asks snape to do it instead of draco she makes him swear the unbreakable vow to protect draco and carry out the deed should he fail    poi    bellatrix kills a fox here but she does nt say avada kedavra which suggests that it can be used non verbally given the number of times other people use it and say the incantation  you kinda get the impression that it can only be used verbally but this would suggest otherwise   bellatrix says that snape lives in a  muggle dunghill   but considering that hogsmeade is the only fully wizard village in britain  would nt most wizards live in towns predominantly muggle  unless you live in the middle of nowhere   this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place   spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth and it s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps  we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up  voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius he misjudges the malfoy family they seem to have very little loyalty to him they see him as a sure bet their work for him is all in their own self interest but the minute when it is nt in their self interest to support him  they disobey narcissa here was nt supposed to talk about draco s mission to snape but she does it to protect her son and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this it s a very slytherin trait to protect yourself first   does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore s side  or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord   snape is able to hide his emotions so well but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily  would he be able to conceal his emotions about that  would he betray himself   are snape s parents alive  what happened to them   do you think snape s attitude toward muggles has matured  because i m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father but that seems like something you can mature out of as an adult  you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to has snape rationalised that within himself  or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily  he did nt seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them does he understand that now as an adult   where does the hidden staircase in snape s house lead to  was that an original part of the house   snape being able to boss around wormtail must ve been so fantastic for snape yeah he s not james or sirius but he s one of the next best options and also partially responsible for the death of lily he has to love bullying him   would nt wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form   it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix   do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus   i know most people seem to love alan rickman s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman s snape does nt say much he picks and chooses his words very carefully but the book snape is much more verbose   snape catches bella out here she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort it s a loselose for her   snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore was that voldemort s idea  or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet  because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts   does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job  i presume it s because it s because of the curse on the job more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse   snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore what information did he give  and how does he hide the vital stuff  does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not   if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps  what changes  how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so   snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever   voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour which seems to have both positive and negative consequences i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters   bella says  the dark lord has  in the past  entrusted me with his most precious  and cuts herself off is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault   jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away   snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance so did dumbledore sacrifice her  did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death  why did he pick her  is snape here lying to bella  maybe he s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him   snape is in his element here when he s insulting harry and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him he s so sincere with his dislike of harry he s not putting on any pretence at all   snape talks about dumbledore s greatest weakness that he has to see the best in people now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him now to me  this is a good lie because it s got a fair bit of truth in it but it s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another   how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore  did it affect him at all  or was snape lying here   what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore s injury  how does he tell him how it was sustained   is narcissa a death eater  she was nt at the graveyard when voldemort returned so is she kind ve an associate  an honorary death eater   why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore  would nt it make perfect sense  otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps  does snape actually know the plan here  or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it  he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious    if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others   draco kinda achieved his goal he only really failed at the final hurdle but the end result was the same anyway so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it  lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book so it would seem not   narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite is she just sucking up to him  or does voldemort favour snape most  and why is snape voldemort s favourite  does voldemort see himself in snape   dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer   snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer but when dumbledore actually dies  there s pretty much no need for a spy the order crumbles without dumbledore they have no leadership and they have no initiative it s almost not worth spying on anymore   bella talks about if she had sons do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her  we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord would bella follow the same route  or would she be utterly psychotic   we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow i m kinda surprised that voldemort would nt make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him maybe he thinks it s unnecessary   what happens with an unbreakable vow if there s some grey area involved  not all cases are black and white   in court  they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings yeah it would be a little barbaric but you d get the truth out of people   i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done   the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow  some

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments445834chapter_by_chapter_538_the_second_war_begins    synopsis   we meet the muggle prime minister he s thinking about all the recent tragedies that have happened a person in a painting coughs and announces the arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet    quotable quote   the trouble is  the other side can do magic to  prime minister ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560764.0,7.0,0.0,14233.0,61124.0,1.0
the painting of the man that was in the prime ministers office was the first wizard prime minister of the wizarding worldit says it in the chapter  i dont have it with me   i think the muggles would be confused and scared of wizards so i do nt know if that was ever a likely scenariobut if it did happen i do nt know if they could even if they unitevoldemort has giantsmagical means of hidingan army of ruthless death eaters and was able to elude capture for decadestechnology at the time was nt as developed to override magic  amelia bones was a powerful witchwe have instances in the story where if voldemort asks them to join and they refuse he wo nt tolerate ithe ca nt have powerful enemies that could fight him  fudge was desperate and weakfudge asked dumbledore to persuade him because he knows that harry might listeneven harry says himself he s dumbledore man through and through  i like your analogies and observations       yay     ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455562828.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,170.0,0.0
gt  we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them  she did nt seem to be on dumbledore s side  in particular  when we saw her at harry s hearing  but i would imagine that a fair minded woman high up in the ministry would be a bit of a hindrance to voldemort in his rise to power once she saw evidence of his return  surely she would nt support him and anyone that was against him was pretty much dead  gt  the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them  i do nt think its their job to walk around the country willynilly  but i took it to mean that the huge amount of them pretty much invading really made a difference even if they were just secluded to certain pockets  their numbers would probably have a noticeable effect  especially since there normally are nt any dementors outside of azkaban  gt  do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world  i was thinking they would be obliviated once they leave office after all  it s not like everyone in politics knows about wizards  it s just them so at the very end of term  maybe on their last day  or maybe there is something like a passing of the torch where the outgoing prime minister introduces the incoming prime minister to the minister of magic and then right after that meeting   obliviate  ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455602132.0,1.0,0.0,784.0,5762.0,0.0

agreed wholeheartedly this movie is why  frankly  i was kind of disappointed with gravity  which was also directed by alfonso cuaron   technically gravity is breathtaking but is still this spacestation hopping modern tale of survival children of the men  on the other hand  is a fictitious world working on this fantastic premise that still works why  it s because it seems to effortlessly saturate us with little things to suggest that this world exists the religious protesters  the ringing in his ears  the family portraits around the room  to answer your question about the fishes i think it was best left ambiguous to pin it to a simple answer  i think they wanted the baby to live and for them to prey upon the blind desperation of the world on the other side of the coin cinematically  think about the little girl in waterworld she is presented as symbol to acquire control in a postapocalyptic world ,movies,entertainment,1455684997.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5844.0,0.0

i m an older dude and a huge genesis fan so i ll give it a shot this is why i do nt like phil collins  phil was the drummer in one of the seventies greatest prog rock bands around respect for that peter gabriel left and phil replaced him on lead vocals after a massive search for a new lead singer that turned up nobody that interested the band  the great music continued with phil on lead vocals in the late seventiesearly eighties really brilliant stuff gabriel was not missed a few albums into the phil led genesis they had a hit song  follow you  follow me   this was the beginning of the end  but not quite yet  then duke great album  but much more commercial that s cool still a great album and the band is growing  abacab fucking hell  this album is fucking amazing the greatest album genesis has ever released imo commercial  a bit  yes does nt matter brilliant stuff  here s where things start going wrong self titled genesis is next mama dark  beautiful and haunting a huge hit home by the sea the hit that was nt for some reason illegal alien pop garbage and utter shit but mtv blew it up the brilliance that was genesis was about to become a pop band money  girls  fame  whatever it was enticing for the band  they would not release another  good  song after genesis side one with home by the sea the rest was commercial bullshit this is exactly where i personally gave up on them as a band and stopped listening and buying their albums  phil goes solo the allure of fame is too much for him it s all radio friendly pap feel it in the air is undoubtedly a great song  but it was supposed to be a genesis song  and should have been phil collins blows up as a radio friendly pop superstar his musical integrity is fucking gone it s one shitty pop song after another absolutely nothing of substance  then he s doing disney soundtracks let me say that again he s doing disney fucking soundtracks  the drummer  later lead singer of one of the greatest progressive british bands of all time has sold his soul and musical integrity to disney for a paycheck  that s actually the last thing i ve heard  or cared  that phil collins has done he s musically irredeemable in my eyes he is the epitome of a sell out i have lost a lot of respect for him over the years ,music,entertainment,1455682527.0,2.0,0.0,42042.0,169593.0,1.0

i m sure i ll get downvoted for this  but as a longtime metal fan since i was like 12  i am really struggling to see how cirice  or even ghost in general  is  metal   this sounds like heavyriff downtuned melodic  rock   what  cause they re playing palmmuted c  tuned guitars they re  metal   where s the doublebass  where s the technical riffs  where s anything north of 80bpm  light  airilyharmonized vocals and  piano breaks  and this is  metal   power chords in 134 downbeats does not metal make  to be fair  thus far all i ve heard of ghost is meliora but that was 30 minutes at my friend s house when he tried introducing them to me where i was barely tolerating it and certainly will not buy it  or anything from it how this beat  lamb of god s 512   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  dulxbkkj9wg  or slipknot in the  metal category   and while neither of which are even in my top 20 favorites bands either  eg  1 is testament   2 is trivium   3 megadeth  but are both at least certainly more  metal   is beyond me i m not asking for meshuggah or arch enemy out of a swedish melodic metal band for a metal category win  but at least maybe  unsun   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  2o2aec2o4w  or something with a little more energy  cirice about put me to sleep  but  oh wait  this is  the grammys  we re talking about  judging metal right  carry on good for them i guess ,music,entertainment,1455666792.0,0.0,0.0,285.0,25491.0,0.0

both times i saw it  it seemed to me that meant that she had been on the island with him before  as a child for that to be true would mean that luke was nt  hunting  for the island  but already knew where it was i m fine with that logic for now  since he may have wanted to keep it a secret wow  maybe he found her there ,starwars,entertainment,1455680304.0,1.0,0.0,234.0,2865.0,0.0

cant  agree with anyone here who wants luke to just use the force and not get involved in any lightsaber battles i totally want to see luke wield that green lightsaber again and go full retard on his enemies like he did in rotj but having said that  i also do nt want him to wield two lightsabers like the op does i do nt want anyone to wield two i do nt subscribe to that whole more is better  philosophy it just looks stupid to me  not badass ,starwars,entertainment,1455665634.0,2.0,0.0,70.0,4312.0,0.0

yeah  that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke  and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh  i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides  are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen ,starwars,entertainment,1455654296.0,13.0,0.0,671.0,20964.0,0.0
not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep 8 or even 9  where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training  but when she completes her own saber  it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle involving rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors ,starwars,entertainment,1455640261.0,50.0,0.0,1.0,4317.0,0.0

it s not his fault  coming from a sports background  he can not truly connect with the players and understand how they feel i m not sure if he played the game or not but to understand a gamer  he would need to play the game and feel the same frustration the players are feeling in episode 4  he failed to see how frustrated the team was with winning against a team with 3 subs  and when he said  can they smile    i guess that pissed off the players to have a coach who do nt understand them how do you coach a team when you do nt know how they think or feel ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455678931.0,1.0,0.0,271.0,140.0,0.0
seems like they re saying kc s lack of game knowledge was too much of a barrier to overcome i wondered if this would be the case sure seems like it would be hard for him to be able to relate to the players and give them advice on a meaningful level if they know he s out of his element compare it to how they received weldon s advice  knowing he has a league background i imagine they ll bring in someone with more familiarity with league as a replacement  although i thought they might just decide jarge would be capable of serving as head coach i guess they want to split up the duties so he can solely focus on ingame strategy  in any case  both sides are being super professional about this  which is good to see ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455674478.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,55.0,0.0

off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,34.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0

thooorin really managed to hit the nail on the head here while he has questionable knowledge about some of the inner workings of the game  he is very good at extrapolating and referencing his points in making a strong argument  kc was never shown having a strong impact on the players and yes  while we base that on the legends series  why is it after 4 episodes we see nothing of positive consequence when he speaks  while it is not defining of how effective he is as a coach to tsm  it does give a hint towards a certain idea  i think what people fail to recognize is that the current iteration of tsm is not like any of the previous iterations of tsm  which thooorin mentions i think kc would have been a pretty good head coach for tsm of season 5  but he lacks the ability to control as many large voices as currently exist in tsm season 6  also that ending alphadraft plug was gold ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647056.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2808.0,0.0

i stopped being able to listen when he was using tsm legends as evidence  up until then he was really on point and i do nt mean to trash the video  but come on it s a reality show  it s not reality the bits they re showing us might as well be the players putting on skits in between their real work like  i like reality shows  but you have to take them for what they are  edit  for people who are unclear on what i mean  let me expand in a reality show  you can prompt people into an artificial situation  ie   kc  give a speech to the team so that we can get that on film   and ask them to respond naturally and even though you re asking them to respond naturally  it does nt mean they will continuing that previous example  maybe kc never gives speeches or even if he does  knowing he s preparing it for legends will change how he delivers it the reactions of everyone else are similarly affected maybe they d normally be jumping in and having a discussion  but because this is  kc s speech time for the camera   they let him talk  maybe bjergsen is asked  bjergsen  how do you feel about this   and sometime when he d normally just sit on his opinion  he expresses it and he comes off as a diva  or maybe he is  but we  do nt know    by prompting someone to do something or say something  even if you ask them to do it naturally  you still can get a contrived situation   everyone  greet svenskeren as he comes in  gives you porn level acting   also  reality shows are trying to tell a cohesive story and editing can severely affect how people look usually audiences will underestimate this  but the affect can be really huge if you want  you can edit basically anyone to look any way you want  as long as they ve ever acted this way someone s the nicest person ever except when they re starving  and they were starving twice this week  i can make it look like they re being nasty to their teammates continually or i can make it look like they re the nicest person ever the truth is somewhere in between  on that vein  if kc s been a not perfect  but pretty good coach  and i m not assuming that  but just for example   i can make him look like the best coach ever or the worst  depending on how that fits my story now  tsm legends is nt looking to vilify the players or staff  so they are nt going to make him look like the worst worst  but in trying to tell a very condensed version of the story  some extreme simplifying is going to happen anyway  because there are only 30ish minutes per episode  and a lot of that time is earmarked for game time  player confessionals  team post game analysis  etc   and you can end up thinking  and this is an example to illustrate my point  not actually what people think   wow  kc is lethargic and unenergetic all the time   when the reality could be  continuing that example  that kc is tired in the mornings ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455646843.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,6384.0,0.0
thorin s honestly right about yellowstar  he s not a great laning support  but an amazing team shot caller and captain for regi to say  after bringing in yellowstar himself  that he does nt want one main shot caller for the team is insane that just diminishes yellowstars worth to the team almost entirely honestly  if kasing had stay d with tsm i believe they would nt have started so poorly  and in my prediction i believe yellowstar will leave tsm or they will continue to fail internationally ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647543.0,33.0,0.0,1.0,648.0,0.0
thoorin is pretty much spot on  tsm have probably the best midlander in the nalcs  one of the best adcs in the nalcs  and yellowstar a very good to support and very good captainshotcaller they should think we re gon na work hard  we re gon na work together  and we re gon na fuck up the whole league thoorin is also spot on that there is a difference between channeling ego in positive and negative ways  the thing that i see is that tsm are not utilizing the pieces they have to their maximum effect yellowstar not shotcalling and not captaining is like having hai and not letting him do his thing also  while the macro synergy is getting better  it s still not there  tsm  right now  is like having a swiss army knife and just using one tool  the reason teams work is because people know  understand  and execute their roles tsm do nt really know or understand their roles  and because of that  they ca nt execute those roles  will this fix itself  if they find a good coach that can get everyone on the same page  or the team can solve their problems themselves  then yes saying you re not on the same page is step 1  but there s about 10 steps after that that are more important  including being able to speak frankly to each other without feeling being hurt about whats been going wrong and how to fix it  giving people a clear framework of what they want to do  how they re going to do it  and what everyone s roles in that are  this is ingame stuff  these are the things i see  edit  it s also pretty hilarious that some of you seem to think he wears a coat in all of his video  when if you d watched the video to the end  you ll see thumbnails of some more of his videos  and most of them he s not wearing a coat however  do nt let facts get in the way of your memes  reddit we would nt want that  would we   ,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455658260.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,3387.0,0.0

this is a repost with pics   original information   i took a dropper  hopper combo from a popular afk fishing farm  and tried applying it to my grinder to dispense swords  it s one dropper facing up into another facing out  to where i m standing   i stand on a hopper which feeds into the bottom dispenser  i also have 3 hoppers that link into the hopper i m standing on  coming from a chest of swords  the problem is  the hopper i m standing on picks up the sword before my character picks it up i think it might have something to do with setting  s  on the server where hoppers seem to pick up items faster than vanilla  andor players do nt pick up dropped items as fast  anyways  i m trying to figure out how i can rig it so that the hopper i m standing on does nt pick up the item so quick not sure how i could do that probably with some other red stone somewhere but it would have to be linked and timed with the clock that is dispensing the swords every  6 seconds    added information    here   http  imgurcomaambrf  i added a redstone signal to the receiving hopper  img1   the one i stand under   while active  this should prevent the hopper from sending an item  the hopper is full of swords   so as a result it can not pick up the dispensed sword until the redstone signal is deactivated  img2   works perfectly the problem i m actually having  now   is that the adjacent hopper  identified with pink wool block  img3   img4  is somehow  through the cobblestone covering it  picking up the sword  so my solution was  simply fill that hopper with swords too  it wo nt pick it up  yay it worked   but   now no hoppers pick up swords  because what happens is  when the redstone signal locking the hopper breaks  img2   the pink wool hopper prioritizes by sending a sword to that hopper  instead of the hopper picking up the sword  so effectively  the dispenser just keeps dispensing swords and they all sit on top of the hopper ,minecraft,gaming,1455652425.0,0.0,0.0,389.0,1907.0,0.0

bit of free build advice to people  although a lot of them will know it already   one thing i hear mentioned a lot to people who are just starting to seek build advice is the  do nt make it all one block  thing mojang s villages are a good example of this even without counting doors  windows  stairs  etc most of their village buildings are made of 3 types of blocks  cobblestone  oak planks  oak logs they will often follow a rule of  do nt make the walls and the floor the same material   so you ll get cobble floors with plank walls  or vice versa   or they ll make the bottom block of the wall the same as the floor to simulate wainscottingkickerboards the logs usually show up as support pillars on the corners of the house even if you use different materials the general idea of having support pillars as an excuse for a different block is a good idea  also if you have nt noticed it yet  those stairbased roofs prevent monsters from spawning on them same with slab roofs so long as it s bottomhalf slabs  although villages do nt use slabs only stairs   mind you they did nt have corner stairs when they designed the villages so they used planks instead which can spawn darkness monsters ,minecraft,gaming,1455010105.0,16.0,0.0,3842.0,19331.0,0.0

one note to give people about building is that flat  crap if you want your build to pop out and impress others  make it 2 or even 3 blocks deep this way  you can add extra blocks to the outside  and make it seem more detailed than just a flat wall  another note added to this is the notion  oh  i m terrible at building  so i ll never make anything good to show off  many of the great builders we see referenced today on the server started out with a similar mindset  find your build style maybe you re not a modernistic type builder  but can make building set in the old west very well or maybe you re good at bridges  but ca nt make walls to save your life find the niche that you fit into for your builds  and start expanding your mind on how to make it unique to you  ,minecraft,gaming,1455019469.0,3.0,0.0,18839.0,122352.0,0.0

i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,pokemon,gaming,1455680278.0,5.0,0.0,13.0,1669.0,0.0
so the one thing that s stopped me from going all the way with completing a national pokedex is that when a new generation is released  it s back to square one  sure you can use pokemon bank to transfers mons across  but this is time consuming and in order to maintain a complete dex you ll still need to be in possession of every evolution stage  what do you guys think about having the option to transfer pokedex completion to the next game  what would be some possible implications  restrictions etc to make it fair  do you think it s a bad idea in general  if so why ,pokemon,gaming,1455679785.0,2.0,0.0,103.0,2599.0,0.0

the elder scrolls  dominion  takes place in the entire aldmeri dominion main plots would involve the build up for the next great war and the imperial attempts to sabotage the military build up may take place concurrently or shortly after skyrim  with only vague references to the  troubles in skyrim  importantly the goals and ideologies of the members of the dominion would be presented in a positive light  with emphasis on how everybody is actually pretty happy  and the economy seems to be booming of course there will be drawbacks  like some racism and maybe the occasional secret police raids  but most common citizens will feel that it s worth it of course the imperial agents  maybe some of them blades or penitus oculatus  will be shown as cutthroat  paranoid agents who will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals  there would be a quest line to combat the imperials or to help sabotage the dominion  though you may be able to do both  the thieves guild may be based in elsweyr  the fighters guild could be a mercenary group that is taking care of policing while the army prepares for war  the mages guild could be a research lab for the war effort  or just a regular college  the assassins guild could be made up of some surviving dark brotherhood members  maybe even some that were presumed dead by cicero  important mechanics would be in game consequences for your actions oh  you helped imperial agents destroy the mill  now the khajit that ran the place is in the street begging for money because he ca nt afford the repairs oh  killed the spy that was bothering that shopkeeper  now she ll happily sell you better goods at lower prices  or maybe offer an alternative solution to a tricky quest oh  you did nt kill the thief that you caught while on patrol with the mercenaries  every bandit hideout now has an extra enemy for a few days oh  you  did  kill that thief  now the thieves guild thinks they ve been crossed and wants you to find out who s betraying them  in this game you have to think about who your actions will affect in the whole world and question whether this is really what you want ,skyrim,gaming,1455592656.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1986.0,0.0

  magic resistance   is capped at 85   elemental resistance is also capped at 85   but it is calculated separately from magic resistance  so you can stack  say  fire resistance on top of magic resistance however  in this case  elemental resistance is calculated as percentage of the damage not blocked by the magic resistance for instance  if i have 80  magic resistance and 20  fire resistance  that does nt mean i resist 100  of fire damage it means i resist 80  of fire damage  plus 20  of the remaining 20  that is nt taken care of by my magic resistance so stacking a 20  fire resistance item or potion on top of 80  magic resistance only yields an extra 4  resistance to fire  for 84  total on the other hand  you can stack capped elemental resistance on top of capped magic resistance  so that you resist 9775  of each spell  85  magic resistance  and 85  of the remaining 15      spell cost   can be reduced to zero with sufficiently high enchanting skill but you can only do this for two magic schools  since the most you can get on a single item is a 25  cost reduction  and you can only put two enchantments on each item also note that the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from enchanting is different from the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from potions having  say  an amulet with 20  fortify destruction reduces your spell cost by 20   but a potion that grants 20  fortify destruction increases your spell damage by 20   there are nt gear pieces that improve your enchanting  because there is no fortify enchanting enchantment  only fortify enchanting potions but this can still be used for   maximizing enchantment power    check out  this brief guide   http  wwwuespnetwikiskyrim  enchanting  maximizing_enchantment_power  on the wiki the basic idea is to get a kind of feedback loop going between fortify enchanting potions and fortify alchemy enchantments  brief a fortify enchanting potion  then make a fortify alchemy enchantment while under that potion s effects  which you can use to make an even more powerful fortify enchanting potion  and so on however  the most powerful fortify enchanting potion you re going to be able to make no matter what is somewhere between 40  50   depending on what patches you re using ,skyrim,gaming,1455569797.0,2.0,0.0,27.0,1317.0,0.0

the concept of an illusion mage really speaks to me  however bethesda could ve done so much more with it then what they did  it s basically 4 basic spells that get stronger from novice to master and then master spells that are also the same except they get an area of effect and then you also get muffle and invisibility  so in my opinion you really only get 6 spells which  after a while  is very boring to play with  is there any mod that revamps the illusion spells ,skyrim,gaming,1455562255.0,2.0,0.0,160.0,508.0,0.0

i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,skyrim,gaming,1455583606.0,10.0,0.0,337.0,4059.0,0.0

man  you had a really good chance to win that game but you made a couple of critical mistakes  1 that fight on the cliff at your third  the rocks need to be taken down asap you should start taking down the rocks with your first couple of zerglings once you ve pushed back the reapers as it s such an abusable position for the terran you also needed to split your army in half and attack the position at the top of the cliff and the bottom at the same time while right clicking all the liberators with your mutas and then focusing the medivacs down that try to escape you also needed more than 5 mutas  you could have had around 1015 mutas in that fight with about 30 more banelings with all the gas you had when the fight started you would have crushed that army  2 once you successfully beat his first push  just focus on expanding again  spreading creep  getting 33  ultras  adrenal glands and most importantly    chitinous plating    chitinous plating is actually the most important upgrade for ultras as they become almost unstoppable without a disgusting amount of liberators or ghosts in that counter attack with the 7 ultras you only had 2 armour upgrades plus 1 base armour for a total of 3 armour ultras that s why they melted to the marine stutter stepping if you had 33 plus 1 base armour plus chitinous plating which gives ultras an extra 4 armour for a total of 8 armour  you could have almost won the game outright with 7 ultras alone unupgraded ultras are pretty bad tbh but they become immortal tanking gods against marine heavy comps like his with the upgrades  so yeah  with a little fine tuning you definitely could have saved the 3rd hatch and crushed his army  and then a few minutes later with fully upgraded ultras and adrenal glands lings with more banelings  it would basically be gg for the terran you re definitely improving and i look forward to seeing your progress ,starcraft,gaming,1455676820.0,2.0,0.0,2436.0,2027.0,0.0

 i am a bot for those of you at work  i have tried to extract the text of the blue post from the battlenet forums   gt  gt     community feedback update  february 12    gt  gt  arkitas  community manager gt  gt  gt  gt       gt  gt  gt    map archetypes post   gt  gt  we wanted to give a shoutout this week to the post that came up describing a potential way to describe different map archetypes  due to how well thought out it was describing a map this way seems to be a great start in order to make sure we have good map diversity in terms of how rushecon heavy a map is  gt  gt  gt  gt  after discussing this post internally  we wondered if we can expand on this concept further so that we can make sure each map stands out in a cool way compared to other maps out there we think the 3x3 grid serves as a great way to define the alignment of a map  s economicaggressive characteristics we wonder though if this  alignment  concept should work alongside another attribute  a unique map  class   archetype  aspect  to give a more complete picture of a map for instance  maps like prion terraces might represent the class of maps which have easytoaccess high yield bases we could have many maps of this class over the seasons  varied in alignment from aggressive to economic we also believe there is room for more of these archetype concepts that really make a map stand out from what we  ve seen in the past  and we  d love to hear your ideas on other creative concepts which we can seek to use in maps of all types within this acre model  gt  gt  gt  gt    map cuts for season 2   gt  gt  we  ll be looking to cut a total of four maps for season 2 the obvious three map cuts would be the oldest three maps in the pool  ruins of seras  lerilak crest  and orbital shipyard of the remaining four maps   granted we want your feedback before we finalize  we were thinking the weakest map remaining is central protocol we received a map submission called  4  invader that is a similar idea to central protocol  but initially looks to be executed better so we  re currently thinking if we cut central protocol  invader could be a good new map to try in that slot to be clear however  we are waiting to review all map submissions before any decisions are finalized  gt  gt  gt  gt    other season 2 maps   gt  gt  we  ve also been reading up on and discussing various ideas throughout the past month or so  and we feel that we may have located a couple cool ideas so far  gt  gt  gt  gt  islandlike map gt  gt  the community has been discussing the idea of having a map that is not pathable by ground at certain stages of the game  and we  ve been looking closely into figuring out the exact points to attempt while having the map still be competitive here are the main points we  re considering on a map like this  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt   can scout early on to reduce the build order coin flip nature of island maps  gt  gt  gt  gt   earlymid game players choose to get into a more of a  island  position by breaking down rock towers  gt  gt  gt  gt   we would need to have enough bases for players to grab  we  re thinking around 34 at least that can  t be attacked by ground unless rocks are broken   gt  gt  gt  gt   late stage  the map would revert to more of a groundbased setup as rocks are broken down  opening up paths to the various bases  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  this approach allows us to move in small steps towards having maps that are more and more like an island  instead of potentially breaking the game by taking too big of a step at once we  d love to hear your thoughts  gt  gt  gt  gt    map with varying attack route considerations   gt  gt  another idea that we thought was interesting is playing around with the idea of having the main attack path to the opponent be easy to defend  and the alternate attack paths being extremely long by ground this way  more mobilitybased units andor air unitbased strategies could be more powerful here are some detailed points that we  d be trying to hit  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt   this type of map would not be a rush map  gt  gt  gt  gt   the main attack path would be a low ground path that leads up to a small ramp the defending player would have a big defender  s advantage if they are able to set up at the ramp outside of their base this area could also be blocked off with buildings and smaller numbers of defensive units  gt  gt  gt  gt   the alternate paths take a much longer travel along by ground  so mobile units would make a heavier usage of these paths  gt  gt  gt  gt   perhaps different paths could open up in the late game  so that the games on this map don  t drag on too much due to the main attack path being too easy to defend  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  and of course  we  ll always be on the lookout for additional suggestions  gt  gt  gt  gt  reaper strength gt  gt  there looks to be an interesting split regarding feedback here on the kr community side  we  re hearing a lot of feedback that zerg has no chance vs reapers in the early game  and on the nonkr side  we  re seeing a lot of reaper strength issues in tvt let  s keep a close eye on reaper strength going forward  and perhaps test a change on the next balance test map if it is needed  gt  gt  gt  gt    pvz ravager timing strength   gt  gt  we  re seeing a lot of feedback about the strength of early ravagers  and we  ve noticed the strength of ravager pushes in pvz while we aren  t sure that a change is definitely needed at this time  we agree that it would be good to be ready with a change by getting a balance test map going this way  if the strategy does indeed turn out to be problematic  we can patch right away  gt  gt  gt  gt  if we are to test a nerf to ravagers  we believe it might be good to test nerfing their ability against immobile units andor structures for example  if each shot damage was reduced or if the cooldown of the ability was increased a lot  or something along those lines this way  if we were to lean towards doing the siege tank medivac pick up removal in the future  tvz will definitely also be less affected as well  which would be a plus if we go with a different solution for tvt mech viability  we would most likely want to look for a different change here as well  gt ,starcraft,gaming,1455302433.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,17973.0,0.0

besides pyro  the only class i consider to be lacking in performance is heavy  who has a number of problems without a medic or a sandwich  heavy has problems performing his job as an offensivedefensive tank the whole point of heavy is to be the center of attention and absorb lots of damage while your team attacksdoes their jobs if your team does nt have a medic  you re screwed 300 is still a lot of hp  but it does nt go very far if you do nt have a medic healing you i think it would be a good idea to give heavy a  20  damage resistance while spun up  on all of his miniguns  or at least everyone of them except the tomislav  which could have a new stat  like extra movement speed or something the natascha and brass beast already have those  but stock is usually superior to both it would give heavy a better edge in fights  and i think it would be very good for him to have some sort of natural damage resistance i also think he could have a small hp regen while spun up and crouching  since he s basically a sitting duck while spun up and crouching  literally  and it could give him some more survivability spies and snipers would still screw you over  but i think it would be fair i would also like it if they brought his minigun back to it s old state  without the weird drop in accuracydamage for the 1st second of revup  and restore it s accuracy however  to balance it out  his minigun takes slightly longer to rev  about one second   it might need another change to keep it balanced  but i ll leave that up to your discussion ,tf2,gaming,1455670915.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0

might as well toss my two cents in  although it s a little late to the thread  for me  the best thing with the contractoriented updates is the contracts themselves it s almost undeniably fun to get a new contract and then complete that sucker gives you a good reason to play  as if you needed one anyhow   where valve got it wrong  1 too many freakin  crates at first  you could immediately sell the crates for pretty good amounts on the market and they were one of the more desireable drops later in the process  they become irritating to get when you want a weapon and the crates are only selling for maybe a scrap or two at first  it s  oh boy  crate  awesome   sell  kaching   about halfway through  it seems you re getting about 50  crates and it becomes  crap  another one of these   and the question becomes whether to unbox and find crap  selling the crate for squat on the market  or just deleting it  2 crates should never  ever  ever have crappy condition skins ever there is an undeniable sense of feeling screwed when you complete a contract  drop a crate  open it  because you re stupid  like me   and end up with a shitty skin worth  05 that just bites and makes you not want to open crates when a contract completion weapon can be more valuable than an unboxed weapon  the system is not working right if you open a crate  the skin you get should be top quality with maybe a 30  or so chance of strange  not potentially shit quality with what seems like about as much chance of a strange as there is of unboxing an unusual i ve unboxed way too many contract crates and ended up with a grand total of one strange which leads me to  3 the incidence of strange weapons in the crates is ridiculously low i think there s a damn good argument for a return to  weapon from a crate is gon na be strange  again  you spend  250 plus tax to open the digital box  you want something of value it does nt have to be a wash or more than you put in  but it should have some value to it especially since you already paid  6 just to be eligible to get it again  it sucks so bad to effectively spend  850 plus tax for a chance to get and open a crate  and then find a nonstrange piece of shit well worn skin it s like gaben just takes your money then slaps you in the face and laughs  4 duplicate skins  especially from crates duplicate skins from a contract once in a while is maybe okay  but overall multiple copies of the same piece of shit just sucks this gets even worse if you get duplicates from crates this badly needs a fix  i ca nt help but think you can still have rare  seldom unboxed items while also largely avoiding duplicates being unboxed  number 4 here was edited for coherency  so in conclusion  i really like the contract concept and find it definitely keeps me coming back to the game i really just about hate the frequency of crate  rewards  especially when the chance of unboxing a strange is very low and the chance of getting a shit to middling quality skin is very high it gives me the distinct sense of being basically ripped off while valve just kinda shrugs i expect that kind of bullshit from a company like ea i do nt expect or appreciate it from a perceived  good  company like valve ,tf2,gaming,1455667132.0,2.0,0.0,8979.0,410807.0,1.0

i m late to this thread but  here s the opinion of someone who has been with the game for a while  when gun mettle came out  it was something new for tf2 contracts were a novel idea  but it wore off quick players had been starved for anything new for the game for a while i d look back at the medic update  love amp  war  sniper vs spy  pyromania you know  those updates that had a 3 day count down day 1  the maps day 2  the new weapons  day 3  the new game modes  updates that added a ton of stuff to the game new weapons  strategies etc now it s just  give us  6 for the chance to give us more money to open a crate for a weapon reskin  the first campaign was new and novel  but now it seems like this is the direction valve will go in and the quality updates of the past are long gone it s why i will never buy another campaign pass and i m sure i m not the only one ,tf2,gaming,1455672866.0,2.0,0.0,3634.0,3647.0,0.0

that guy honestly sounds like a bit of a douche  in hl  of course good engineers matter  even if not as much as some other classes  because both teams are made to run one any increase in skill your engineer has that the enemy does nt is a bonus to your team  in 6s  engineers do matter a lot less though because explosive classes are always run 99  of the time  medics do their best to utilise ubercharge to the full  and generally you will have less time to set up a sentry as well engineers do still shine at lasts  where their defensive power makes them useful for wasting an enemy uber and shutting down scouts  but if you want to play 6v6 as an engineer main you re going to need to be able to play other classes for the 80  of the time where an engineer is nt that great  in matchmaking  nobody knows what will be good yet maybe engineers will be the most important class probably not ,tf2,gaming,1455650874.0,29.0,0.0,234.0,13881.0,0.0
gt  one of the coordinators of the hl team i m in is a 6s player  and downright dismisses engineers i ve gotten a littletono feedback on my playing because simply   i do nt care  and while i ve tried to make engineer have a good name in the past  on rtf2   i m questioning my main is it time to just give up my favorite class  and become a boring soldier main  i have no clue    protip    bad leaders are a dime a dozen  i m sitting out this season  so forgive me if i m mistaken  but did nt ugc just get done playing steel or steel is the upcoming map being played  that map  of all maps  is the one where i say engie is absolutely pivotal you have your team escort engie with a level 3 sentry into the e cap room  suddenly the defending team has a huge problem on their hands and tons of pressure to deal with only took a couple steel games for me to notice a pattern of this  and soon after i was taking special care to watch my engie and offering to go with him to guard him and buy him some room to get his sentry up  obviously when the combo itself was headed that direction anyways of course   get a sentry in e  suddenly most of their classes can not actively pressure e to stop your cap  and only a couple sightlines or classes can continue harrassing the point even if a spy is fully confident he can get the sap  the respawn time for anyone that s died fucking hurts even the best spy can fail a sap attempt  and a failure there is 20 more seconds of cap time even if they successfully deny e  the effort that s been demanded of them to do so means they ve had to surrender the other active point  largely thanks to the sentry  do nt let this kind of shit get you down  there s all kinds of bias from players against everything possible  and constant claims that this or that class is worthless or easy tons of 6s players hate hl classes  tons of hl players have a grudge against 6s classes  etc etc etc for engie  i find it s common for a lot of 6s players to dislike the class because a sentry can deny a scout and a jumper completely  which is obviously quite dull for them the result is plenty of claims the class is easy since you have an aimbot in my opinion  most of those people are simply trying to validate how pro they are by claiming their class and their work is leagues above that of their comrades the reality is that each class provides it s own challenges and strengths it s all just fragile egos needing reassurance and validation  and honestly  not hating on your friend as a person  but realize many people want to be a leader for the  prestige  of being a leader the people that actually have what it takes to lead are a small fraction of the players that want to lead so they can gloat and talk about what a tactical genius they think they are i would expect a leader to have at least some sense for each class and how to best utilize them  and if i m correct that currently ugc is playing steel and this guy s response to how to best utilize engie is  i do nt care   then i seriously question his leadership engie would be a fucking cornerstone of any steel strats i d use  personally ,tf2,gaming,1455657493.0,5.0,0.0,3181.0,37590.0,1.0

pro tip for office working bachelors  if you want to look sharp and successful  always iron and starch your work clothes  even if they re not wrinkled there s a noticeable difference between a wrinkle free shirt and a well ironed shirt there s nothing wrong with the former  but the latter projects a better image  also  pay extra attention to the cuffs and collar both should be nicely starched  always from the inside rather than the outside to avoid flaking or shine  and just a little bit stiff ,adviceanimals,humor,1455644056.0,14.0,0.0,13555.0,159116.0,0.0

spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers source  my ass,circlejerk,humor,1455677272.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,9523.0,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,circlejerk,humor,1455642176.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,864.0,0.0

people who say things like this usually drink exclusively bud light but refuse to try craft beer  and think the epitome of fine dining is a 2 for  20 meal deal at applebee s they ca nt understand why anyone would ever pay more than  3lb at walmart for a steak  and still buy dvds because blurays cost a little bit more and they  do nt really see a difference anyway   they describe anyone who has a nuanced understanding of their hobbies and are willing to pay more to enjoy different facets of those hobbies as  a douchenozzle who smells their own farts out of genuine crystal pinot noir glasses  a red plastic cup works just fine to drink 2buckchuck  and it s easier to chug that way than out of a tiny wine glass  liking simple things and dismissing everything else as elitism is a mindsetway of lifeidentity that a lot of people adopt when they either do nt understand something or ca nt afford nicer things ,circlejerk,humor,1455642618.0,35.0,0.0,56.0,7077.0,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that

the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

you may be interested in  this similar question   https  wwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments3s6k0iposts_from_tankies_on_communist_subs_and_similar  about the use of marxian theory in history that i answered previously i do nt talk about historical materialism specifically  but marxian theory more generally  in terms of historical materialism specifically  i d say archaeologists have probably been some of the most enthusiastic adopters this makes sense to a degree since the study of archaeology is the study of material culture  and so the thesis of historical materialism is already in the wheelhouse of archaelogy one of the easiest things for archaeologists to determine from archaeological data is information about the relations of production in a society  and so historical materialism is attractive because it then proposes a way to use this easily generate data  on production  to talk about issues that are harder to discuss using archaeological data social organization for instance  v gordon childe  an avowed marxist in his political life  outside his research   has probably one of the more famous uses in his  neolithic revolution  model in this model  the development of craft specialists  aided by a transition to agricultural society  is one of the primary driving factors in the development of early states since he elaborated on this model in the 1930s and 40s archaeological research has indicated the origins of the state are much more complex than his fairly simple economic model  but that model still stands as an important component of the bigger picture even if it does nt tell the whole story ,askhistorians,learning,1455653921.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4064.0,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,6.0,0.0,27.0,16414.0,1.0

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,5631.0,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,5.0,0.0,27.0,16414.0,1.0

the reign of peter the great brought about great societal upheavals in 18th century russia which brought the country out of a sort of dark period and attempted to enable russia to catch up to the rest of europe western education was held in a very high regard  the style of dress was altered from a more traditional russian style to one that closely followed western european fashion of the day men were forced to shave their beards or pay a  beard tax   to make the population appear more civilized education in everything from medicine to military strategy was also closely reformed to match that of england  france and the low countries peter and his court travelled regularly to western europe and emulated everything that they deemed might be of help in aiding russia s advancement by the mid to late 19th century  it was not uncommon for a wealthy family to have western european tutors educating their children and the opportunity to send them to a fine western school with a curriculum closely mirroring one that might be found in london or paris unfortunately  this type of education could only be afforded to the upper crust of society  as the vast majority of russia at the time period that  anna karenina  takes place in were farmers with little to no money ,askhistorians,learning,1455676844.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4571.0,0.0

thanks to ucaffarelli for suggesting the topic  like 5 months ago   the concept of  ideal body  in terms of form and proportion reaches as far back as the greeks  if not earlier  and has informed representation of the human form in greek sculpture and other arts  additionally  at other times and in other cultures  there has been discussion of  cleaning the warts  of a ruler in royal portraiture to depict a leader as particularly handsome and charismatic as a corollary to that  there is the case of shakespeare s description of richard iii  where the disfavored former king s physical deformity mirrors his faults of character  elsewhere in western literature  there are numerous depictions like  the hunchback of notre dame  or joe bonham in  johnny got his gun  that depict people with bodies outside of contemporary notions of  ideal  or  whole  with all of that prologue in mind  we can introduce some questions for discussion   how do scholars of nonwestern societies interact with those societies concepts of beauty  human form  and disability   how have concepts of masculinity and femininity interacted with ideas of the  ideal form  or deviations from that ideal   is disability a form of subalternaeity   have societies made strong distinctions between disabilities that are congenital and those that are the result of injury  particularly battle injury   what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability   a special note with this one some may object to the use of the term  disability  in this post  preferring other terms like differently abled people may also object to the dichotomy proposed between  ideal body  and those falling outside of that ideal  it was not my intent to be insensitive or insulting in my use of these terms if anyone is offended  i apologize discussion and criticism on these points is welcome ,askhistorians,learning,1455572976.0,22.0,0.0,633.0,9424.0,0.0
when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,30000.0,1.0
with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,5.0,0.0,3726.0,46618.0,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,11.0,0.0,131.0,23237.0,0.0

gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a

the eic may have been a very vast network of commerce  but it actually had a great deal of financial difficulty over the years until it was finally dissolved in 1874 by the east india stock dividend redemption act of 1873 this was nt due to a decrease in value of goods but rather repeated issues with the company internally and its interactions with india  things really started rolling downhill when a drought struck bengal in 1769 instead of intervening or offering any assistance the eic raised its taxes  and the resulting strain on their credit and shares forced them to ask for a bailout from the british government in 1772  the eic tried to recover from their troubles by focusing on one of their largest exports  tea they were granted the privilege of cutting out the middleman and began exporting the tea straight to the american colonies  the resulting taxes from which led of course to the boston tea party in 1773   the eic managed to keep itself a float  if only barely  with the combined revenue of the tea and their secret opium smuggling from india to china however  they finally went belly up when tensions spiked in india with the rebellion of 1857 no longer confident the eic was worth its expenditures  parliament stripped the company of its duties and absorbed the assets and forces the company continued to exist in name only until the stock dividend redemption act finally shut it down for good  source  bibliography of the east india company isbn  9780712357784,askhistorians,learning,1455579893.0,46.0,0.0,167.0,51.0,0.0

well let s start from the beginning how does you body make energy from food  glucose does nt just magically turn into raw energy that your body can use instead  it is subjected to dozens of chemical reactions performed by enzymes in your body the enzymes are proteins honed over millions of years of evolution for perform basically a single reaction at speeds thousands or millions of times faster than would occur otherwise the pathway that turns glucose into atp  which is the main energy currency of your body is pretty complicated  but if you want a simple image just imagine a factory that takes in coal at one end  and runs a powerplant at the other there are special machines that first clean the coal  then sort the coal  then grade it  then crush it  then transport it  then dump into the furnace that is specially designed for sorted  graded  cleaned coal you could nt just dump a tree  or a container of natural gas in one end  and expect the factory to work  now your body has a lot of enzymes designed to deal with all sorts of compounds and lots of those compounds can end up being turned into atp  energy you body can use   fats and proteins obviously  but also other things  for instance ethanol but importantly  not everything lots of compounds your body has only rudimentary one size fits all  processes to deal with or some compounds  like water  are at the bottom of the energy ladder as far as your body is concerned this is why you ca nt drink petrol and hope to burn it for energy you body has no enzymes to convert it to atp so zero calorie energy drunks have no  or very few  compounds that your body can convert to energy they have no sugar  no protein  no fats just caffeine and water and artificial sweetener  the other thing that i realize now that is throwing you off is the word  energy   energy drinks are so called because the claim to give you a feeling of energy  this is due to caffeine  and perhaps sugar in the nondiet ones   they are not claiming that they supply your body with biologically relevant energy sources  they are claiming they will give you a feeling of energy due to the caffeine ,askscience,learning,1455661966.0,9.0,0.0,216.0,8073.0,0.0

 nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ,askscience,learning,1455663201.0,1.0,0.0,216.0,8073.0,0.0

the sensor that these lenses project their image on is rectangular it s possible to construct a circular sensor and obtain circular pictures  but people tend to prefer rectangular pictures  on the other hand  producing rectangular lenses is more difficult than producing circular ones  so we end up with circular lenses that project an circular image that is larger than the sensor  while the rectangular sensor registers the central part of the image  you can see the effect of the lenses being circular in the image  to some extent a phenomenon called vignetting causes the image to darken as you move away from the center when taking a picture of a uniform background  you can see the corners of the image being slightly darker than the center  the strength of this effect depends on the quality of the lens and the apareture setting used  ,askscience,learning,1455637913.0,12.0,0.0,821.0,19067.0,0.0
this is because of the difference in the heat of moist air vs dry air  the equator receives the most sunlight of any area on earth quite a bit of this solar heating goes into evaporation of water  rather than raising the temperature itself  so the equator itself is a bit cooler than if the earth were bone dry  all this evaporation creates warm  moist air over the equatorial oceans  which begin rising and forming clouds this warm air deposits almost all of its moisture in clouds at equatorial regions  but the air itself continues rising that same air  now very dry  then begins to head in the direction of the poles  but is halted in its journey around  30 degrees latitude  the socalled  horse latitudes   as the coriolis force prevents it from moving more poleward it then proceeds to descend as very dry air around those same latitudes  eventually looping back closer to the surface to the equator  now all this dry descending air around the horse latitudes leads to a vast area of deserts at those locations in the northern hemisphere  there s the american southwest  the sahara  and the middle east in the southern hemisphere  there s the atacama desert in chile  the kalahari desert in namibia  and the australian outback obviously not everywhere at these latitudes is desert  since local currents can affect the area s climate  but deserts are the general trend  so why is it hotter there  it turns out that compressing dry air as it descends from high altitudes over these deserts will raise the temperature quite a bit more than the temperature decreased as it rose over the moist equator decompressing moist air in general  moist air changes temperature about 6 degrees c per km  while dry air changes about 10 degrees c per km this is because moist air recoups some of the heat lost to the original evaporation when that water vapor condenses as clouds as latest heat  so we start at 30 c over the equator and lift up the moist air to 3 km where clouds are formed  losing moisture as clouds  and the nowdry air is at 12 c the dry air then continues upwards up to about 10 km  where the additional 7 km of height decrease the temperature down to 58 c it travels poleward  when it then descends the 10 km as dry air over the horse latitudes  where it s now heated to 42 c  hotter than it originally was at the equator ,askscience,learning,1455475284.0,66.0,0.0,975.0,48236.0,1.0

the magic of bonding to enamel is because of a process called  acid etching   http  wwwslidesharenetmahmoudmohsinacidetchingofenamelandbondstrength   not because there is anything special in the adhesive used slide  5 of this presentation shows a microscopic view of enamel following treatment with an acid etch the material inside these tiny tubules is dissolved by the acid which then allows the composite adhesive to flow into these irregularities the adhesive is formulated with a light curing initiator so that when a certain spectrum of blue light hits the composite  the liquid adhesive becomes hard so basically the bond of the adhesive to the enamel is a mechanical lock the bracket also has a rough surface that allows for a mechanical lock  this same  bonding process   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  q_fhmesa2rcis  used by dentists to adhere fillings and porcelain veneers for bonding orthodontic brackets you apply a small dab of acid etch gel  usually colored blue  to the center of the tooth for about 1530 seconds and then you rinse it off dry the enamel then has a chalky appearance that is different from the shiny appearance of unetched enamel you apply the liquid adhesive and hold a curing light  blue spectrum  over the area and the liquid instantly cures and becomes hard  if after the etching process  the enamel is contaminated with saliva  salivary proteins will flow into some of those tubules and create a weak bond you know a bond was contaminated when you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off and you see no adhesive stuck on the tooth and it s all on the bracket other times  you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off with most of the adhesive on the tooth and none on the bracket and this is because the patient chewed ice or something else hard that exceeded the tensile strength of the adhesive  when braces need to be removed  there are special tools that grab the bracket and cleave the mechanical bond  which usually leaves a blob of composite on the enamel  but sometimes leaves a blob of composite attached to the bracket the blob of composite on the enamel is then removed with sharp chisel like instruments and smoothed with very fine burs  i had a patient in braces one time and they just disappeared we could nt get hold of her and did nt see her for two years we finally located her and realized that she had removed the braces herself  she also dropped out of school and had a baby  with pliers fortunately she did nt damage the enamel anywhere and she was able to get the brackets off  but each tooth had a blob of rough composite in the center which i then smoothed away ,askscience,learning,1455625161.0,38.0,0.0,3222.0,6487.0,0.0

from einstein s equivalence principle  which existed in more primitive forms even in newton s work   the only physical difference between being in a constant gravitational field and being in an accelerated frame is tidal forces  which are generally defined as any difference in gravitational force over distance if you re on the surface of the earth  you never feel any tidal forces on your body  nor can you measure any change in the gravitational field in a decent vicinity of your position but already if you check out the period of a pendulum at different altitudes  you start to notice that the gravitational force the earth depends on where you are  this was noticed before newton   and if you want to work out planetary orbits you definitely need to include how force varies like 1r   2   so if everything you re considering allows you to set g  98 ms  2 everywhere  then gravity is equivalent to acceleration  but this breaks down as gravity varies with position ,askscience,learning,1455605705.0,6.0,0.0,72.0,8830.0,0.0

without the chip  any compromised terminal can copy the information on the card this allows for fraudulent payment even while the card holder maintains possession of the card  which means the fraud is often not discovered until much later the chip facilitates the use of encryption  so that the particular information from the card and the processor network received by the terminal are only valid for that specific transactionthe data can still be copied  but can not be used for new transactions and is therefore useless  the  mass migration  is because the credit card networks are now incentivizing merchants in the us to accept the chipif they do not  they bear the cost of fraud  and not the issuer  as with most fraud   so now not only will the issuers benefit from issuing chipenabled cards  but the merchants will want to accept and use those cards as well ,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455644353.0,17.0,0.0,24.0,32322.0,1.0

planes in the air are still affected by gravity in order for them to stay off the ground  a force has to be applied in the opposite direction of gravity  aka lift   now planes can get lift two ways the common way is using wings as air moves over the wings  the shape pushes most of it down increasing pressure under the wing and decreasing it above you can experience this yourself by sticking your hand out of a car window the second way in some jet powered aircraft  the force of the engine is enough to lift the plane without using wings this works the same way as letting go of the end of a balloon both of these are contingent on having enough air to either power the jet engine  or provide lift under the wings as planes fly higher  the air gets thinner until it is not enough to power the engines or provide enough lift under the wings to get to space  you need a rocket that brings its own air with it to power its engines,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455682679.0,1.0,0.0,114.0,16146.0,0.0

when you say  clusters  are you more referring to galaxies  as in why do nt they continually disperse as the universe is accelerating  if so  then i ll say this we attribute  dark matter  as a force that pulls and keeps things together  like galaxies mathematical calculations reveal dark matter to amount to about 25  of all the mass in the universe  remember  mass has an equivalent energyforce  thanks to einstein   this is in contrast to  dark energy  which we call the force which pushes the universe apart and we attribute as the cause of the exponentially accelerating expansion of spacetime calculations reveal darn energy to amount to about 71  of the mass in the universe  we know these two things exist we call them  dark  because they do not interact in any manner of a directly observable spectrum  and in fact we ve yet to deduce a manner in which to measure them directly when you have a feeling something is there  but can not take a picture or measure to account for it  you carefully account for every single other variable that you can  whatever externalities left over which serve to unbalance your mathematical proofs afterward are thus  dark  but nonetheless must exist in some fashion  for instance  we know dark matter  pulling force  exists after a hubble experiment measures the speed at which stars in the milky way move around the galactic core logic says  the stars nearest to the core must be moving around the center at a higher rate if speed than those stars around the edges  as an analogy  hypothetically  imagine a hubcap on a car that has bolts right around the center and more bolts at the very edge of the rim  not very realistic  but moving on   you d imagine those those bolts right around the center of the rim are spinning at a faster velocity than those on the outside of the rim  moving at the same rpm but around a shorter distance stars in the milky way should follow suit  right    only they did nt all the stars  besides those in the immediate death zone proximity of the super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy  are rotating around at the same speed which  all else held relative  means there must be some external force  dark matter  outside the halo of the milky way which is  tugging  on all of the stars to maintain this equivalent speed crazy  right   we ca nt put it in a beaker and measure it directly  but we can observe and measure it s influence to some degree  sorry for the long winded response  i hope that this is nt too hard to digest and makes some sense ,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455685365.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10511.0,0.0

this provides more evidence that you should eat high quality food  not just the cheapest type sold  in this study the problems result from contaminants and toxins in the fish  not the from eating fish in general this is why wildcaught salmon are so nutritionally different from farmed fish you could cross reference this study with studies that show how environmental toxin exposures causes rapid weight gain  relevant quote   contamination by environmental pollutants in fish could provide an explanation for the observed association between high fish intake in pregnancy and increased childhood adiposity  ,science,learning,1455656596.0,3.0,0.0,142.0,323.0,0.0

first  some background information   nasa powers outer solar system probes  such as  new horizons   https  enwikipediaorgwikinew_horizons   with  radioisotope thermoelectric generators   https  enwikipediaorgwikiradioisotope_thermoelectric_generator   rtgs   these are passive nuclear systems fueled by the decay of  plutonium238   https  enwikipediaorgwikiplutonium238   pu238    there is an  impending bottleneck   http  wwwscientificamericancomarticlewithinnasaaplutoniumpowerstruggle  in the supply of pu238 due to a decadeslong hiatus in its production by the us department of energy  which will somewhat limit outer planet probe options in coming years  at least beyond jupiter  where highefficiency solar cells have become practical    pu238 is a specific isotope of plutonium that  when produced at high grades  efficiently generates heat by its radioactive decay it is not the same as plutonium isotopes used in producing nuclear fission fuel or weapons  and as such nasa can not simply borrow plutonium from these applications probegrade pu238 must specifically be manufactured   this manufacturing has recently restarted at a low level  but it will take years to ramp up two years of effort in 2014 and 2015 were required to create the first 50 grams of rtggrade plutonium under the new production  and at an 8figure cost that congress had balked at for years the rate will increase  of course  but   kilograms   of the isotope are needed for each rtgpowered probe  and only 15 kg of new fuel are expected to be produced by 2021  now  i ve been reading up on apollo 13  and an  interesting factoid   https  enwikipediaorgwikiapollo_13  spacecraft_location  came to my attention  the apollo 13 lunar module  lm  was ditched into the pacific ocean when the crew reentered earth s atmosphere in the command module  on board that lm were a series of longterm lunar experiments  and a certain type of generator to power them guess what kind of generator  yup  an rtg with 38 kilograms of pu238  none of which was ever used because the apollo 13 lm never landed  and thus the fuel was never inserted into the generator for the experiments  to avoid contaminating the oceans with radioactive material in the event of aborts or accidents  that particular design of rtg  the  snap27   https  enwikipediaorgwikisystems_for_nuclear_auxiliary_power  snap27   was designed to   survive reentry intact    and it reportedly did so in the apollo 13 return ongoing monitoring of the area has not detected radioactive leaks  i m sure you see where this is going  but there are specific questions that are worth asking    1  what would be the condition of that fuel after almost half a century of passive decay    since i am not a nuclear engineer  i ca nt answer this categorically wikipedia says the halflife of pu238 is 877 years probe rtgs degrade in function much more quickly than that because the radioactivity erodes their physical components  and because power output declines as the decay proceeds  but in this case we are only interested in the state of the fuel  so  if  this is a straightforward matter of applying the halflife  a strong majority of that 38 kilograms should not yet have decayed in the 46 years since apollo 13 is that the case  and if so  does this decay ratio directly indicate the amount of useful fuel available  let s assume the fuel is largely undecayed  the next questions would be about getting to it the apollo 13 snap27 was impacted into the  tonga trench   https  enwikipediaorgwikitonga_trench   an area of the south pacific just north of new zealand  at a depth of about 61 kilometers    2  does nasa have a good fix on the location of the snap27    if the landing ellipse for the rtg is a significant span of ocean floor  then this concept dies here  the time and money to find it would cancel out any advantage to nasa of recovering the fuel if they know where it is  or have it within a narrow range  then it s worth continuing to explore    3  what is the practicality of recovering it    to give a sense of the size of a snap27  here s a photo of one on the moon  https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbb3snap27_on_the_moonjpg you can see from the footprints in the background that it s quite small so that means finding it would be somewhat harder if nasa s idea of its location is more generalized  but also means that picking it up and taking it away once it s found would be trivial  assuming no leaks are detected  since that would invoke strict environmental protocols that would preclude transporting it  from the violence of reentry and ocean impact  most likely it s nothing more than a cylinder  by now covered is some thickness of seafloor muck visual identification would therefore be harder  and of course you would  hope  that it could nt be detected by its heat  for the reasons mentioned before so the operational side of immediately finding the object  even if its location is closely known  would not be trivial  systems exist  and have existed for a long time  that are capable of operating at 6 km and recovering an object that small  especially robotic submersibles james cameron has personally been nearly  twice as deep   http  wwwcbsnewscomnewsjamescameronreachesrecord7mileoceandepth   so the recovery technology is not in question  the weak link would just be seeing it we can speculate about various sensor methods  magnetic  seismic  etc  but this remains an open question    4  if recovered and processed  would the total cost and time yield significant net advantages to nasa outer planets exploration    of course the skeptic s temptation is just to say  if it were worthwhile  they would already be doing it   but that does nt reflect the reality of a bureaucratic federal institution that is constantly buffeted by both internal and congressional politics the fact that they are not currently trying to recover the apollo 13 plutonium means almost nothing  since of course every idea has to start somewhere  even if there had already been proposals that went nowhere  there are so many nontechnical reasons why that happens that it usually does mean nothing  eg  if the department under which the proposal occurred got its budget cut and did nt have the time to investigate it  the individual pushing for it left nasa  or died  or found a more interesting project  it was passed from one office to another until people just forgot about it  etc etc the vast majority of ideas that ever come up  go nowhere for reasons like that  so neither answer to this question would be shocking  that it would be a complete waste of time and money that s already been thoroughly investigated and rejected  or that it would make sense but just never came up in any place high enough to matter  the fact that nasa is  optimistically   one might even say desperately  touting the planned creation of a mere 15 kg of new fuel over the next halfdecade  an absurdly long timeline that even then is sparking skepticism due to low funding levels  suggests this might be worth a look      update  according to  this article   http  wwwspacesafetymagazinecomaerospaceengineeringnuclearpropulsionwillanyonerecoverapollo13splutonium   courtesy of schroedingerspen in comments  the fuel has decayed too far and would also be too difficult to locate it does nt give many details on that  but it is a plausible answer from a credible source greater details would be appreciated if anyone has them in any case  the plutonium issue is a fascinating one to explore irrespective of the apollo 13 question   ,space,learning,1455522864.0,46.0,0.0,30544.0,74640.0,0.0

explanation of the   7   rule  since it took me a minute to understand  your number  say  889  is split into 10x  y  or 880  9   we want to know if 10x  y divides by 7     so we multiply by 5   10x  y   5  50x  5y  multiplying a number by 5 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume m and n are integers a number   7m  n    where n is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  multiplies by 5 to become   35m  5n    dividing evenly by 7 must remove the 35m  leaving 5n 5n will not divide by 7 unless n  is  7  therefore if   7m  n   is not divisible by 7  neither is the product of it and 5     we then subtract 49x  which is   always   divisible by 7  and 7y  which is also   always   divisible by 7    50x  5y    49x  7y   x  2y  subtracting a multiple of 7 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume p  q  and r are integers a number   7p  r    where r is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  subtracts some value   7q    the difference remaining is 7p  7q  r  or   7  pq   r    because p and q are integers  pq must also be an integer  meaning 7  pq  is a multiple of 7 the remainder when 7  pq   r is therefore r as with the original number  meaning if   7p  r   is not divisible by 7  neither is the difference between it and a number that  is  divisible by 7     therefore  to see if a number of the form 10x  y    88   0    9    is divisible by 7  we may test x  2y    88      18    instead  hope this was helpful      ps this method is way easier than the godawful  1024  method  or however it worked   plus  this one chains    889  7   8818   7  70  7   70   7  7  7 ,youshouldknow,learning,1452673203.0,1.0,0.0,2174.0,19864.0,0.0

i m not sure rfrugal is where you want to seek information for this particular transaction you re asking if this a good deal for a car that fulfills more than just your needs in a vehicle if you need four wheels and a roof  no the car is not a frugal purchase or great  deal  if you have 17k to spend and want a small suv  no it still is not a great deal however  if you want a toyota highlander that is not exceptionally old  has a reasonable amount of miles for the model year  and is available for sale it is worth considering understand that having been a fleet vehicle means that at one time it was a car owned by a company and driven by multiple drivers that may have abused the car  hence the slightly higher than average miles per year  it also means that there was most likely scheduled maintenance checks and repairs done in order to keep the vehicle on the road to transport said potential abusers this company also probably had a milage cap on when they would sell off the vehicle before repairs were costlywhen value would nose dive personally if you are not mechanically inclined i would stay away from any former fleer vehicles  they are great deals on auction but there is a lot of inherent risk and potential cost in these vehicles ,frugal,lifestyle,1455375867.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0

another thing to consider is the home s actual energy efficiency  rather than just the energy star label  although an energy star label is usually a good sign of energy efficiency   see if any of the builders will give you a hers score for their buildings a hers is like the miles per gallon for your house a standard code house has a score of 100  on average across the country  and a net zero energy house has a score of 0 the lower the score  the more efficient the house  in addition  you ll want an  asbuilt  score as opposed to an  as designed  score an  as designed  score means that the house in theory is a certain level of energy efficient  but that they have not tested the built house to see if flaws in construction have made the score worse  they do   an  as built  score means that they have built a house  it has been tested  and it has received an energy efficiency hers score of a certain amount  a hers score is also tested and given by a third party  so a builder can not simply give themselves a good score ,frugal,lifestyle,1455544321.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0

this is my freshly sbr d cz scorpion evo 3 s1 it s a 9mm parabellum blowback rifle made in the czech republic by cz it started life as a  pistol  and it was trash  if you know only one thing about this gun it needs to be that without a stock it sucks ass but with a stock it s a blast to shoot and will bring a smile to anyone s face i m going to give you my thoughts on it in case you re thinking about getting one  for pros of this gun i d say it feels great in the hands even though it s a little over six pounds  it s a good weight it feels very solid when you re shooting it secondly its pretty accurate i was able to hit the steel plate at 150m with this very easily as long as my hold over was correct this gun is also just fun to shoot  between having very little recoil and slapping the bolt closed on a fresh mag  operating it is just different than a ar15 or ak i also think this gun looks very cool  its different then most other popular guns out right now mags are really pretty cheap  you can get them for  20 a pop which is nice the stock is very solid and works well to really sum up the pros of this gun  its just plain fun  now for the cons  which there are many like i said earlier this gun sucks as a pistol  one of the reasons being the ambi safety it rubs your finger and even breaks the skin after a while when you shoot so i bought the ambi safety delete from cz then there s the trigger  holy shit it s just bad  i really hope someone makes a smooth aftermarket trigger for it i replaced some of the springs to make it lighter  and it s still dog shit and now we get to the rails at the front  they are very uncomfortable to the point where im going to have to buy some rail covers for them  so if you re thinking should i buy this gun  you need to first ask yourself do you want to sbr it if the answer is no then do nt get the cz evo  but if you are willing to get the stock for it it makes a great little rifle that s tons of fun to shoot and is nt like anything else at the range i m not saying its better than the mpx or the ak9 or an ar15 in 9mm or whatever but it is a good gun if your looking for something fun to take to the range   here   http  imgurcomazvmbv  are a couple extra photos i took today ,guns,lifestyle,1455657743.0,13.0,0.0,3989.0,3010.0,0.0

becoming a machinist is a fine idea  but honestly only about 510  of the work i do as a gunsmith involves machining most of it is general repair  cerakoting  troubleshooting  problem solving  making or replacing parts  etc there is definately some barrel threading  drilling amp  tapping  and other machining  but a huge portion of the job is just repair i d bet most of the people in here offering advice have literally no experince or knowledge about the trade people always love to answer this question with made up info it s very interesting  a huge part of what i do is called  box o  gun   people try to fully disassemble their guns or fix them i end up with a box of 100 parts empty frame  dozens of similarlysized but importantlydifferent pins  weird shaped connectors and doodads  etc a lot of these guns are old and there are no schematics or pictures to help with figuring them out you have to use your deep knowledge of guns  how they work  and have an engineering  puzzlesolving mind you sit down for a few hours and you build the puzzle if you can do that  you can learn the machining and other stuff you need secondarily being able to build  box o  guns  is the most important skill to have  by far it s the same skill that will help you modify or make your own parts sometimes someone is missing a part  and replacements are nt available and there are nt even any pics or drawings of the part you need to use the same problemsolving mind to be able to figure out what that part looks like and how to make it and make it function ,guns,lifestyle,1455679233.0,1.0,0.0,727.0,1567.0,0.0

make sure to switch your dryer circuit on your fuse box to off and unplug the dryer  open the door to your dryer and you should see two screws on the upper corners of door recess on the front panel  this will allow you to lift off and remove the top panel of the dryer  now you will see one screw in each of the upper inside edges of the dryers front panel  remove those and the front panel will be free put this forward and it will release itself from the drum of the dryer  the lip that the dryer drum was resting on is where you will see the dryer bearings they are plastic  same as the nalgene bottle  or teflon tabs that are about 1cmx6cm in size with a hole on the right side and both ends tucked into the plastic housing if your dryer is squeaky  one or more of these bearings are worn through and you have metal on metal contact  hence the squeaking    here is a picture of where the dryer bearings are located   http  imgurcomgalleryej3fo96   here is a picture of what the bearings look like   http  imgurcomscerexx  take your nalgene bottle  the old milky white ones with the blue lid  not the newer hard shatterproof ones  and use some heavy scissors to cut a strip of the bottle that is wide enough that it will just barely fit into the slots on the lip where the bearings go drill or puncture a hole in the strip so that both sides tuck into the slots and the hole catches the little prong repeat with all worn bearings  now you can stick your hand into the inside of the dryer barrel and lift the front end back onto the lip where the bearings are and close the dryer in the reverse of the order you took it apart  enjoy dry clothes without the horrible squeaking  also  if the lip where the bearings are located is broken to the point where you can not install new bearings  you can order a new bearing unit online for a few bucks and extend the life of your dryer  cheers ,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455517063.0,3.0,0.0,159.0,7958.0,0.0

i agree i used to do this when i was in college it helped so much to make sure i was getting everything done that i had to and in return i would nt stress or freak out especially as things came close to due dates and exam times i would do like you mentioned and do things at certain points of the day so i was nt staying up until 2am quite so much and was getting better sleep even now i still plan my day and what i m going to do with my hours including free time and put in at least 30 mins for exercise it just really helped me to not stress out about things just having them in my calendar was nt enough for me i think it s great you have this system for people to use to help plan out your schedule better i still use paper myself lol maybe i ll give this a try ,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454870723.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6248.0,0.0
i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo s bouncing around in my head i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time  and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively  enter the scheduling system i ve been using this method for the last few months  and it has rocked my world i m getting more stuff done  and more importantly  planning for free time and using it constructively the best part is that it s very simple    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up i write about nobs strategies to improve your daily hustle  http  hackthegrindnetsubscribe     scheduling the day  a productivity method for entrepreneurs  until recently  i didn  t have a productivity system i didn  t really need one  there was always work that needed doing  and i had various side projects to fill out the time i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another  but  letting my tasklist run the day had downsides work expanded to fill the amount of time i had  meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity also  those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren  t going anywhere  my tasklist dictated my time  but in a haphazard  thoughtless way when i had something in front of me  especially with a deadline  i attacked it but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve i was great at bottomsup execution  but not so great at topdown management  then i returned to consulting  and with it  multiple clients  complex projects and numerous deliverables  i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects the  flow  wouldn  t do i needed a system    tl  dr  the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist  project tracker and calendar into one entity every night  i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects  and i schedule them to available timeslots completed tasks are checked off and disappear  those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session i try and fill in the entire day with appointments  even if they  re just  go for a walk  or  travel to client    it works because scheduled things get done   the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful  sustained progress on larger projects i  m much better at prioritizing  because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours  the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well it  s like eating healthy if you  try to eat healthier  from whatever  s in front of you  you won  t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep one is aspiration  the other is a plan  the scheduling discipline works even when i don  t follow the actual schedule  which is nearly 100  of the time scheduling merely sets the goalpost going off track doesn  t change the fact that i  ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it  which is the real struggle  here  s how i do it    tools  note  this is obviously for a mac setup i  m sure you can find analogs for pcandroid  i just don  t know what they are   fantastical 2  desktop and iphone apps the os x calendar on steroids has a lot of nice features  but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar   iphone with siri and reminders my system works only if it  s supereasy to enter new appointments and reminders   icloud account  for easy syncing between everything     the process 1 throughout the day  i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2   remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning    i always schedule tasks for a general time like  tomorrow afternoon  or  friday morning   it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling  2 each night  i review and schedule tasks this 1015 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day first  i pull up the calendar in fantastical  and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot  to be handled in sequence  while a longer project will get its own slot  3 in that same nightly review  i schedule the day  s activities i use one primary account  icloud calendar  and put blocks down for projects  workouts  transit time  prep time for appointments  phone calls  meditation  meals and whatever else i want to accomplish  4 during the day  i stick to the calendar when possible i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for  5 but i don  t worry if the schedule gets blown up sometimes i get taken off track by something important other days  i  m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to  and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency it  s like eating pizza after a hard training session  discipline earns you guiltfree slacking that night  i honestly account for what i did and didn  t do  and push things back accordingly    an example here  s a heavily simplified use case a client has given me a project with two discrete items  a task to check in with someone  and a hour of actual work to do   click here to see diagram   http  iimgurcomzbgntfppng    the benefits    doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain   an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it prioritizing tasks  estimating timelabor and thinking about when to do each item batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work  better followthrough on tasks scheduling things improves the chance they  ll get done  period  even if i don  t actually do them on the schedule it seems nutty to schedule meditation  for instance  but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in     free time is anticipated and used   i used to stumble over pockets of free time  and when i found them  i didn  t know what to do with myself now  i fill wideopen spaces with productive uses of energy     planning around my natural energy levels   i can block out time for big projects in the morning  schedule email replies after lunch  and generally anticipate what i  ll be best at     better prepped and more polished   scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents  talking points and questions even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one    important caveats    this is not about being a robot   the schedule is a guide  not strict  i prepare it as though i  ll stick to it  but i rarely stay 50  on track think of it this way  my natural productivity is about a c with this system  i plan for an a  and in executing wind up around a bb     this is not about  manager  s schedule     my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon     this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day   i actually relax more now  because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks  cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm  and leave weekends completely clear    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider

one of your assumptions is wrong we all like to concentrate on that type of accident where the biker is riding along minding his own business and out of nowhere comes a lunatic in a car who kills him of course that can and does happen  but in  too  many many accidents the biker is partly to blame according to david hough  proficient motorcycling  40  of motorcycle fatalities had a bac of 010  or above in addition  way too many bikers ride way too fast and careless for traffic conditions  you have only to check youtube to verify that there are also too many new bikers and returning bikers who do nt get proper instruction those are the catagories of bikers who are highly represented in the fatality and serious injury columns avoid those things and you have heavily slanted the odds in your favor do nt drink  drug  and ride  do nt ride like an idiot  and get all the instruction and practice you can and you will not guarantee your survival but you can count on it being a pretty unlikely event that might get you ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672670.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,333.0,0.0

the fear or innate feeling of uncertainty is nt something that goes for me do i fear that which i have no control over  sure but it s up to me to be ruled by it or to own it and do with it what i will since in the same vein you have no control over your body  while its not common you could goto sleep tonight and never wake up  brain aneurysm  heart failure  etc the same things that happen on a motorcycle can happen in a car you could get swiped by a kid in his sweet lifted truck and end up 6 feet under  honestly there s no real way to say do this and this and it wo nt bother you in my opinion i would nt want to be oblivious to the dangers being oblivious or ruled by them makes for poor judgement and oftentimes does more damage than understanding and using this fear as motivation to be better  vigilant  perceptive and proactive about your safety  how long it takes you to get to that point is all up to you man  good luck  hope to see you with some wheels soon ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672019.0,1.0,0.0,129.0,1662.0,0.0

so i have a 2000 ninja 500r i got her for  500  but she had been sitting in a garage for  5 years i had the shop run a full inspection and put about  1000 work into her  new tires  brake pads  etc  to get her up and running she had less than 30k km on her  and for a few months everything seemed fine  the first minor issue i noticed was when she had some trouble starting some mornings it d take a few tries  and sometimes you had to wait a few minutes  but i could always get her to start  one time  as well  when trying to start her  there was a loud  pop  sound  immediately followed by her starting i was nt sure what had just happened  so i looked the bike over  eventually figured that it was okay  and rode off  things were fine for a long time after that  at least six or so weeks without an issue then  more recently  she was having trouble starting again then  just a few days before she died  the engine cylinders were making rather loud rattling noises when i was riding i asked a friend what it might be  and he said it was one of the cables riding up against the engine  causing resonance he told me it was no big deal  and if i keep riding it would go away  well a couple days after  and the cylinders were still rattling then  in the middle of the road  the bike just dies on me it felt like a sudden  snap  and suddenly the engine would nt start  or even attempt to start   i thought it might have been the chain coming loose or breaking  but that was not the case  so now the mechanic believes it to be an engine or transmission issue  likely going to cost more than the bike is worth to fix  so she s probably going to be scrapped and sold for parts now instead  anyone have insight into what might have gone wrong  i ll also mention  i had been riding in the rain and harsh weather for most of the past few months i m sure it did nt help  but i m just trying to figure out what went wrong ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455660387.0,3.0,0.0,9880.0,84118.0,1.0

like others said  it probably valvecam related hard starting can be a sign  at least on single cylinders  of tight valves you could have smashed a valve into the piston  or rattling can be a sign of busted cam chain tensioner  and your cam chain snapped  causing valve into piston carnage could be a lot of bad things  frankly  its time for an engine swap which is actually a very easy process as long as you are careful this can be done with mostly basic tools  patience  and a garage to work in all you need to find is a suitable donor engine   like this   http  wwwebaycomitm0009kawasakininja500rex500enginemotorcompleteheadcrankcase2000141905360607  hash  item210a37f6df  g  3piaaoswb4nwwxvwamp  vxp  mtr  more involved process would be a top end rebuild  pull the valve covers and see what you find before paying a mechanic another dime  oh and do nt listen to your friend anymore  he sounds unhelpful  edit  fyi  engine swap would also replace transmission so technically you do nt need to fully diagnose and pinpoint the issue to get back riding ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455668531.0,2.0,0.0,64.0,4619.0,0.0

 before amp  after   http  mimgurcomaigytu  i posted in rloseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone s stories about being healthy and losing weight  mine basically started with the fact that i have depression which is something that i ve always had to deal with and always will but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca nt change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i m overweight  i hated how i could nt fit into any stylish clothes  just sweats and 2xl tshirts from walmart i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could nt fit into anymore i hated how i could nt go outside one of those pics i m in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that s not a very healthy way to live life  around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would nt miss for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go and then i cut out alcohol within the first month i lost 2530 pounds right there then i cut out red meat  which did wonders for my energy i also started walking everywhere workschoolshopping  and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs  you get the picture after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing  kick boxing and jiu jitsu i ve always loved mma and it s amazing what all of those  boxing especially  did for my muscle and weight loss really toned up my shoulders as well  i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do nt notice it and it s so good for you  just baby steps losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on   these are all pics of me throughout 2014 when i was at my heaviest  302 lbs    http  imgurcomanoeop   this is me as of last weekend   http  imgurcomamloql ,progresspics,lifestyle,1455595523.0,75.0,0.0,23973.0,38032.0,0.0

i m 25lbs down  169 this morning    and still have another 15 to go  aiming for 155 i m enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body  from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal htwt should i knew that would mean slower progress  but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time  which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later when i first started midseptember  i used mfp religiously at this point i do nt use it very often  and instead keep a loose running total in my head  and monitoring my activity with my fitbit i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet  or when i forget the specifics of a certain food i ve found that strict calorie counting  using mfp  for instance  has tradeoffs for me i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably  which is great but  i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every daymostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life i think for some people it s quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it  for me it feels the opposite  like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger  more defining part of me than i m comfortable with so  i ve decided i m ok not doing it all the time  but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing  in terms of changes i ve made to eatinglifestyle  1 keto since midseptember  this has definitely changed my body s needscravings for food  and how i view food i still love the experience of food  but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy it s fuel  and also social  and also an experience  but mostly fuel   since about middecember i ve started doing intermittent fasting  if   though i do it more loosely than some do i usually have a fatty breakfast  2 eggs  a creditcard sized filet of salmon  half an avocado  and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream   then i eat nothing but coffee with creamhalf and half until dinner  which is usually around 68pm i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i m eating lots of carbs my blood sugar is level  so while some days i ll notice the absence of food  most days i do nt   started c25k in december   more generally  i m more purposeful in exercise i was already exercising a fair bit  36 halfhour walks a day with the dog  plus rock climbing during the week   in early december i got a fitbit  and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise i ve tried to just up my exercise slowly now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks  3 halfhour runs in the neighborhood  c25k has been great    and 2 hourlong rock climbing workouts at the gym since the beginning of january i ve also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts i use it for lower body  arms  and abs  slowly increasing how much time i do each for example right now i can do about 1056 minutes each on those using that app i recommend it  though it has some clunky parts  so yeah  25lbs down  15 to goi m excited to have passed a new decade on the scale  and i ve found this community very helpful and inspiring thanks for letting me lurk ,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154.0,3.0,0.0,86.0,320.0,0.0

hi everyone  i started at around 17 and a half stone maybe even 18 stone  i use to eat mcdonald s for breakfast  kfc for lunch and burger king or pizza hut for dinner  i would also snack on chocolate  crisps  and drunk a lot of fizzy drinks  when i first started exercising i would run for about 20 seconds then be sick   i would even get our of breath going up stairs  now i can run for about an hour  okay not run but a good jog  while exercising definitely helped changing my diet was the major factor in helping me loose weight  i now eat around 1500 calories a day then if i want pig out a little at the weekend  i still have about a stone to loose but i am so happy with the progress i have made  before pic  12 june 2013  http  iimgurcomvbrqw0ljpg after picture 12 feb 2016  http  iimgurcomxtyejoujpg http  iimgurcomozimvvpjpg be lucky ,progresspics,lifestyle,1455298934.0,56.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0

my  22f  boyfriend  23m  of 7 months got the results of his most recent lab work today and found out that he has hsv1 based on my last testing  done in december of last year  i don  t have it  but i do plan on getting testing again soon despite me telling him that it  s very common and that the symptoms are not always severe  he believes that his life is over as he knows it he feels that he  ll never be able to have a regular relationship  get married  have kids  etc many of the things he wanted to do prior to receiving the diagnosis  i am still interested in being with him  but he  s really worried about transmitting it to me i told him that it  s still possible to engage in activities with the diagnosis and that just because one partner has it  the other one is not guaranteed to get it and maybe this sounds na  ve  but even if i were to get it  in my opinion herpes is basically a skin condition that may or may not flare up that is usually otherwise benign in other words  though i would not like to not get it  it would not be the end of the world if i did also  because it is so common  i feel like even if i don  t get it from him  there  s a fair chance that i could get it in the future  am i being na  ve  is he being overly dramatic  or is it a combination of the two  what should i tell him  also  he plans to get retested and i plan to get tested again this week  edit 1  he was diagnosed via blood test for igg antibodies tl  dr boyfriend recently diagnosed with hsv1  feels life is over,sex,lifestyle,1455667737.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

i m a pretty ugly guy  there is very little about my face or body that would be considered attractive i know attraction is subjective  but i highly doubt any woman would consider me a 7 or above i imagine the subjectivity of attraction means i range from 25  maybe a 6 if i m particularly witty that day and i m not saying i only want supermodels  but i do want women i m attracted to given that there is nothing physically attractive about me  going for women who have attractive features means i m batting out of my league  it s well understood by almost everyone that attraction is an important part of a relationship  and pretty much the only factor in a hookup or fuck buddy situation nobody wants a relationship without attraction  that s just a friendship but when it comes to ugly people  apparently this does nt apply i m told to lower my standards  and take what i can get i should be grateful for unfulfilling sex with women i m not attracted to if i want a one night stand  it has to be with a woman as ugly as me  which is nt very tempting if i want a relationship  i m supposed to look past the physical and see the inner beauty  even though no woman with options would ever do that for me  i see a lot of unattractive couples  but honestly i think they re with each other because that s all they can get  and they both know it there s no passion  no attraction  no lust it s just that or dying alone you can call me shallow  but how many of you would date someone you were nt attracted to  i ve never felt passion  chemistry or mutual attraction i ve never been desired or lusted after if good looking women are nt attracted to me  why would an unattractive woman fancy me  the answer is they would nt  they d be settling for me just like i d be settling for them  and the relationship would be a sexless  passionless sham  is there any hope for people like me  am i making sense  or is this all just depressive bullshit  if so  why  tldri feel like i ll never have a good sexual relationship because the women i want are nt attracted to me  and the women i could get would just be settling for me  and i d be settling for them ,sex,lifestyle,1455658500.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,249.0,0.0

a thread here got me thinking about something i just realized i ve never thought to ask before when my wife and i have piv sex  we do the usual inoutinout about a quarter of the time  and the other 34 we grind against each other s pelvises  for her the grinding simulates her clit and deepspot  for me it s twofold it feels like she s either milking me or gnashing the tip of my penis hard against the end of her vagina now  that second sensation is only possible because my cock is slightly longer than her pussy is deep there s about a quarter of an inch of shaft that either does nt go in  or if it does  it s because my penis is slightly bent inside her if she was half an inch deeper  this sensation would be completely gone  i know because i ve had exes that were deeper  now  on to my question when you  or your partner  grinds is there a sense of  completeness   for lack of better terms  if the penis is slightly larger than what the vagina can fully engulf  or conversely  is there a sense of lacking if the opposite were the case ,sex,lifestyle,1455656698.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,553.0,0.0

one way to start is with massage my gf really likes being touched  both in a relaxing and in a  get in the mood  kind of way it s a nice  slow  affectionate way to get her naked and put my hands all over her then eventually i m kissing my way down her spine and she s wiggling her hips toward the edge of the bed and things heat up from there  one way to finish is with a leisurely  round 2   after a nice hard fuck i ll need a minute  or two  to catch my breath  kiss and cuddle and while i m not always physically capable of repeating an  a  game of vigorous sexual athleticism  sometimes it s nice to just roll over into the spooning position and reenter my partner it s not about chasing another orgasm  well  not to begin with anyway   it s just about the wonderful feeling of holding her tightly as our hips rock together  joining our bodies as deeply as possible while i kiss her neck and tell her how wild she drives me  i mean it  is  sex  and it usually leads to more sex and more orgasms but it does nt have to  and it s not the sort of thing you need to warm up with stretches for ,sex,lifestyle,1455666633.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,86.0,0.0
me and my girl kind of have a similar issue she s very into just getting fucked  the more control i take and the more i basically use her sexually the better for her most of the time she likes it rough and manhandley  sometimes though we like to get more lovey and passionate it does nt happen often but when it does its always spur of the moment the other day we were visiting my parents and we were getting a little freaky at night time started having fairly hot sex but it was getting a bit loud cuz of body contact and bed and we heard the bathroom door down the hall close and she hopped off immediately kind of panicked and we got under the covers but we were both still turned on and she reached back and guided me in  so we start having sex spooning and i do nt know what it was but man did that heat up  we were grinding into each other and grabbing each other like we ve never done before she could nt keep in her moans and pulled my hand up to cover her mouth we were biting and clawing at each other it was so hot we were moving together so well omg best sex in a loooong time  anyway just let it happen but just do positions that enhance intimacy spooning works well for us ,sex,lifestyle,1455671993.0,4.0,0.0,31.0,1978.0,0.0
so i know this kinda fits into the  orgasm troubles  bit in the faq but it s different hear me out  i m in my early 20s  have been masturbating since before i started kindergarden  not that i knew what it was  and apparently doing it wrong or so i m led to believe at the moment  there s a very specific position for me to be in  a very specific amount of pressure to apply to a very specific area and a very specific motion i also like visualising myself in situations that i could nt be in in real life now  do nt get me wrong  this is quite useful because i can get myself off from no arousal in about 2 minutes by myself  the problem is  i have a partner now i have no insecurities  except for fear that i will take too long  or spectatoring issues with him there s plenty of foreplay and we re pretty open so i do tell him what i like etc and he puts a great deal of effort and time into helping me but in the end i always have to revert to my own way  which is also quite  closed  to his further participation due to the position  and by then i feel horrible about how i could nt orgasm   and also feel bad about the visualisation because it feels like i want to cheat on him if that makes sense   so it takes a while for me too i can tell he feels awful about this  i tried masturbating in other ways but when i m not paying attention i find that i always revert to my own movement so that did nt work i also tried not masturbating for a long time before one of our sessions and that did nt help either  what do    tldr  girl has been masturbating the same way for the longest time  nothing else gets her off thus having issues with boyfriend  needs help fixing them  ,sex,lifestyle,1455649373.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0

hey  all i ve posted several times in here with questions about my inability to orgasm  and each time  you ve all been very helpful  i m at the point where i m sensitive every time we have sex piv penetration always feels  great   if he starts rubbing my clit during penetration  even better  because my legships start shaking 80  of the time i m getting really wet  i m really happy  i m super turned on and loving every second of it  so where s the orgasm  i ve been told to try fantasizing during sex  but that does nt really work for me i ve tried  and i always wind up wondering what it is exactly i should be thinking about  which takes me away from the moment  which is the opposite of what i need to come  my so helped me learn how to grind to hit my gspot while i m on top  and that always feels awesome  but i think when it starts to feel too good i ca nt keep going with the same intensity  which means i ca nt get there it s like i get too weak or something i m not sure how it happens  when i was asking him about my gspot  lol  bizarre  right   he suggested i explore down there by myself  but i do nt know what to do i ve tried masturbation in the past and it s always boring and does nt feel good it does nt feel bad  but it feels like nothing i guess i just ca nt get turned on enough by myself  even with the help of porn or erotica or anything like that  suggestions ,sex,lifestyle,1455668312.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,690.0,0.0

my girlfriend  24  f  has never had an orgasm and has not masturbated before  so i gave her a vibrator for her birthday so we can spice up our sex and hopefully help her achieve the o when we tried it  the vibrator is a clit stimulator   she would always end up laughing  saying it tickles when either i use it on her  or when she tries it on her own is the vibrator something she needs to get used to or are we not hitting the right spots ,sex,lifestyle,1455650678.0,8.0,0.0,21.0,33.0,0.0

my couple of initial thoughts on troubleshooting this be to try it on top of underwear  as maybe it s a little too specific or intense or that the vibrator is more on the  buzzy  side and a more  rumbly  one could feel a better and just in case  make sure she s aroused  as lots of unaroused clits do nt like to be messed with ,sex,lifestyle,1455656175.0,2.0,0.0,1824.0,3874.0,0.0

sounds like you re not using it right if she s not really aroused or the vibration is too pinpointed on one spot a lot of times i get that tickled feeling too you need to let her use the vibrator on her own to figure out exactly what she likes  probably in private  without you  and then she can show you for me its a combo of making little circle motions around my clit area with my legs kinda spaced apart pressing down on one spot or just shoving it down her pants is nt going to do much a lot of times if you re not doing it right it either tickles like crazy or if its directly on the clit it can be somewhat painful so just be careful if you re doing it to her let her completely figure it out and then show you my bf puts me on my stomach  ass up  and sits in between my legs and plays with it like that and it drives me to orgasm almost every single time figure out what she likes and do nt be afraid to try every single position  sometimes that detail is all it takes ,sex,lifestyle,1455684960.0,1.0,0.0,11467.0,88.0,0.0

hi all  i m a teen guy  16  who might have sex with my girlfriend in a few months i m uncircumcised  so i m not sure how sex works with that i m assuming that  as i ll be hard  i ll just do it with my foreskin back the whole time so it s my bare head in continuous contact  obviously it s pretty sensitive since i m uncut  but i m assuming the inside of a vagina is wet and soft enough to be comfortable  or no  i ll also obviously be using a condom if i end up doing it  so how will this make it harder  thank you so much in advance ,sex,lifestyle,1455619681.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
not being circumcised is the norm in a hell of a lot of places  and it s the natural state of a penis sex is nt any more difficult with a foreskin  in fact it s probably easier since there is less of a necessity for lube  your foreskin will move just like it does when you masturbate it slides up and down practice putting a condom on a few times and masturbating before you are planning to have sex so you can figure out how to do it properly and comfortably  the inside of a vagina is wet and soft  unlike your hand the sensitivity you feel is a good thing  though the sensations of sex can be a little weird the first time since you think a lot about what you re meant to be doing and feeling try to relax  you have nothing to worry about  and remember that everyone was inexperienced at some point but you will work it out with time and practice  the faq is a great thing to read  so i would recommend you take a look happy sexhaving ,sex,lifestyle,1455644075.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,14711.0,0.0

it works the same way for circumcised and uncircumcised the foreskin naturally rolls back as you thrust in and exposes the head for all that nice vagina kissing  when wearing a condom  you have your hard cock as normal  pinch the top of the condom  place it on the top of your penis and roll down you should have a good bit of excess condom at the top to catch cum and what not as you move in and out with the condom on  your foreskin will naturally move a bit  but it all works the same 8090  of the work is not circumcised  so it is pretty normal  ,sex,lifestyle,1455650265.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,72.0,0.0
i ve been with my boyfriend for over a year  and we re long distance we see each other every few months and spend time at each other s houses  so plenty of time for fun for when he s not there he bought me a lovely realistic dildo vibrator and it feels very much like him  and i think this is part of the problem the first time i used it over the phone with him  i had an amazing orgasm  but burst into loud  ugly  sobbing tears for about 15 minutes afterwards the intensity of emotion was unreal  and i felt quite depressed afterwards my boyfriend was lovely about it  and put up with my apologising since the evening felt a bit ruined after that  it s recently happened again  we have nt seen each other in more than a month and it s another two before we ll be together again and i was dying to feel him it felt so good  but completely overwhelming  and once again after a pretty good orgasm  i burst into floods of tears i felt exposed  vulnerable  and just wanted my boyfriend there to cuddle me i felt bloody awful afterwards  guilt for not focusing on getting my boyfriend off and ruining the post orgasm bliss  and just a sudden drop in mood i missed him like hell and was very upset for the rest of the night since i could nt shift the emotions after i stopped crying  and just wished i d got myself off manually like i always do  since that always gives me pretty great orgasms and a lovely blissful comedown for some reason  penetration without my boyfriend just seems towell  not work it brings me down that i ca nt enjoy that sort of thing alone  and i have to stick to one way of doing it please tell me i m not alone in this  although i feel like i might be  i know crying after sex generally is a thing   am i doomed to clitoral stimulation only when my boyfriend is nt around   forgive me if i sound bitter and depressed  usually i m much more level headed about thingsbut i really really want the d  people   ,sex,lifestyle,1455585520.0,355.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

soo  first of all  srry for my shit english back to the topic  i love giving oral sex to my girlfriend buuut  i ca nt make her cum we have sex almost every weekend when she comes to my place and viceversa and we ve been together for about 6 months now and this thing frustrates me because i m not the only one in this relationship and i want to make she feel good yes  she really enjoys sex  but i ca nt make she cum i did it one time  she cummed twice  but only then the idea is that she is saying oral sex is tormenting her and it does nt seems to be so enjoyable for her neither if i play with her clitrois or labia when i made she cum was by masturbating her  finger in   but if i play with her pussy  oral or by hand  it does nt look like it is super enjoyable for her often when i give her oral  at some point sometimes she says to me something like  you are tormenting me  how long do you want to torment me    that basically means she wants to put the d in the v faster the same problem occurs when i lick her nippels i love them  but it does nt loke like she enjoys this thing so much  for me it s strangewhat s the problem  am i doing something wrong  an ex of mine had super intens orgasms when i gave her oral sex and playing wither tits  nipples was intense for her i think i could do her cumming only by playing with her nipples  do nt get me wrong  i do nt compare she with my ex she is wonderful and much above my ex  i really love her  but i want to know what s happening cuz i really want to satisfy her also  she never masturbated no  like never ever  she never did this this thing could have some  influence  ,sex,lifestyle,1455626053.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

first up  girls think crying is ugly we often think it s cute and endearing when you let yourself open up emotionally about things  such as swans being gay or what have you   even more so if you re open to admitting they do nt one hundred percent make sense to you it admits a degree of vulnerability  to not have a rational answer to something  and as someone who loves to feel protective  nurturing and like i can give my partner security  someone to feel safe with  i ve always loved to just be there when a partner feels this way stop stressing about this you re not mood killing spin your focus less on the stopping your crying  let it out  feel depressed focus instead on not apologizing  apologies detract from something we re doing  as if we should nt be doing that instead of saying sorry  try saying thank you for being so kind  as it affirms that we re doing the right thing and helping just by letting you get your emotions out never be ashamed of being emotionally open with a partner because this means they ll always be in love with the real you  have a comic to help   http  wwwboredpandacomstopsayingsorrysaythankyoucomicyaoxiao  as for the sex side of things  because i m not on the cesspit that is rrelationships and should focus on the sex side of things  orgasms are fucking crazy seriously  orgasms  can kill you   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  i9ul_pud17i   getting a bit emotional when your body goes through all that  topped off with a rush of all kinds of hormones like an electrochemical plant in a hurricane yeah  sometimes you cry  so  do nt stress out about that side of things  and put less focus on your orgasms without him focus on what it feels like when your toy is inside you  and get a little more intimacy by using some good lube  not just your pussy  and warm it up in the sink for ten minutes first this ll give you a radiant heat that gives you some intimacy light a candle spoil yourself to unwrapping some chocolate that has a nice foil or elegant plastic wrapper  imagine it s your lover s clothes instead  and that melting is the foreplay  the bite is the orgasm think about that  and realize you do nt just go straight for the explosion of flavour of chocolate  if you want to really enjoy it you let it melt you enjoy it even if it s not a whole chocolate  a whole orgasm  every bit of it  even the smell  is divine  so  focus on how it feels inside you  the shape of your toy  where all the vibrations come from and flow to drink some wine breathe deeply and let tears stream down your cheeks if you feel emotional  because that s the depth of connection you have with your lover most people take  decades  to find explore loving yourself  and do nt just do it for yourself  if you can really find out how to make your own body feel good on an even deeper level than normal  would nt that logically then make you a better lover for your man when he comes home  touch your toy and imagine it s him completely  spiritually tell him what you think about when you stroke your toy  satisfying your own fantasies in a far slower and more relaxed setting have a nice long bath or shower before you play  too  and moisturize or oil your body slowly with a heater on in your room  the reason i give all this advice is because it sounds like you re approaching sex as almost like you re obligated to make your body cum  and that kind of feels like where your depression is coming from you re struggling to get what you have with him back you need to focus on exploring new things  not trying to emulate the old  lt  3 i hope this helps it turned into being a pretty long writeup  but hopefully this helps you not just feel closer to him  but closer to yourself too often  we forget how much pleasure lies in the exploration of mind  body and spirit  not the sex itself ,sex,lifestyle,1455596185.0,55.0,0.0,2603.0,104311.0,1.0

if you re feeling terrified and full of dread  do not go along with it stop where you are continue to talk about it continue to fantasize about it or role play with it  but do not actually do anything until you can think about it  without  being terrifiedfull of dread that way lies trouble  and it is  okay  if you are  never  comfortable with actually having a threesome  and note that there s a difference between being scarednervousanxious  kind of like the feeling you get before going on a roller coaster or going into an interview  and feeling like doom and gloom is going to descend on you if you do something  the thing with a threesome is  if everybody s going to play with everyone else  eg it s a triangle  not a v   then it s a positive if everyone  wants  everyone else  it s about everyone sexually enjoying everyone else if that s not something you can see yourself wanting or being okay with  then this may not be for you at the very least  it may not be something to jump into head first  i say that  because your thoughtsfeelingsreactions can shift over time  if you do  eventually  decide to engage in a threesome  understand that there s always the possibility that your boyfriend will pay more attention to the third party  even if it s not on purpose this does nt mean he does nt love and want you  but newnessit s exciting  you might even find yourself paying more attention to your guest than your boyfriend  in any kind of group encounter  you have to be willing and able to speak up and say  hey  can i get a little attention here   or  you need to have a nonverbal signal with your partner that tells him  i m feeling a little left out  or  slow down  you can also negotiate some things being  off the menu  for your first time out you say you changed your boundary from him not having piv sex with the third to him not coming inside her is that something you want  or were you just trying to make him happy  if it s the latter  you may need to revisit that boundary  bottom line  if you re not comfortable with something  do nt do it and do nt negotiate it if you decide you want to engage in a threesome at some point  find a middle ground with your boyfriend talk your boundaries death make a rule that if either one of you wants to quit  at any time  that you quit  though please be respectful to your third partner should you quit in the middle of things  and do nt act on anything if you feel that dread ,sex,lifestyle,1455567588.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,1337.0,0.0

before doing anything outside your comfort zone  it s always a good idea to communicate really really clearly about expectations talk about it  and then talk about it some more it does nt have to be tedious  it can be sexy fantasizing together  a threesome especially has great potential for awkwardness because it s an odd number third wheel  is a phrase for a reason  something that might help to consider  what do you want the dynamic of the threesome to feel like  possibilities   you and the bf focus on the other girl  sort of team up to pleasure her  bf and the other girl focus on you  you and the other girl focus on bf maybe you guys rotate between all these dynamics  sex  really  any interaction between people  always has a dyadic component that is  when it comes down to it  there is always an interaction happening between two people in a twosome  it s always the same two in a threesome  it switches around  and you ll have multiple twosomes happening at the same time  in sex particularly  one partner is always doing something to the other partner ie at the barest level  person a touches person b in a certain way and produces certain sensations it feels twoway if person b then reciprocates  or does something to person a at the same time in a twosome  both partners can always be simultaneously doing something to each other  it s a little harder to focus on two people simultaneously  so in a threesome  the reciprocity is not as straightforward  this might be getting way too abstract anyway  go back to the possibilities and think about which one you would be most comfortable with see if that helps ,sex,lifestyle,1455590125.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,0.0

if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,conservative,news,1455658094.0,1.0,0.0,137571.0,11206.0,0.0

this is the difference between the liberal mindset and the sane  to liberals  money is a sign of how evil you are have a lot of money  must have swindled it from some unsuspecting poor victims  being poor is a sign of virtue to them  to the sane  its the opposite wealth is nt a static zero sum game wealth is created by helping others if you provide goods or services that others feel is of benefit to them  they give you little paper tokens in exchange for that good or service that says  hey  this dude helped me  and you can then exchange that token to get help from someone else that actually benefits you so wealth is a sign of helping others  of being a productive and constructive member of society the more money you ve earned  the more you ve helped people  if you re poor  and not the legitimate victim of some unfortunate catastrophic disease or accident  it s a sign that you have nt helped others either through youth and inexperience  laziness  poor decision making or intentional parasitism  bernie is not the victim of any legitimate catastrophic disease or accident he s certainly not young and inexperienced so his lack of wealth is do to what  laziness  poor decision making  or intentional parasitism ,conservative,news,1455595122.0,0.0,0.0,76.0,4893.0,0.0

as much as one would hope attacking trumps conservative bona fides would be effective  i think the rules are different this year  i am no trump supporter  and if he is the nominee  well i probably will pull the plug for him over a clinton or a sanders it is right back into the  who is worse  decision we have had the last several election cycles  i think this election is different this president has so thoroughly screwed up on the basics that the voter is keenly aware that you can not take those basics for granted his stimulus spending and the economy was an utter disaster  and we could have probably emerged from this recession sooner had we not gone down that path his attempt to nationalize the health care industry has been utter failure  generating 30hr work weeks his wide open border immigration policy has glutted the market with unskilled labor that drains the safety net and our public school system  and depresses wages for citizens who traditionally worked them his foreign policy apology tour  russian reset  picking the muslim brotherhood in egypt  drawing red lines then doing nothing  blaming terrorist action on a youtube video rather than the secretary s optics policiesall of this is screw up on all the basics  so when trump goes out there and thumps his chest on immigration  or he talks about building up the military  or running the economy like a business  and not once apologizing for the nation he loves  people see he has the basics right over and over he hammers on these basics all his focus is on that  and people understand it  so when a paul or a cruz gets up there and makes a nuanced consitutional point  they do nt really get it  and they come back to trump  and how he is going to be the payback for what this president screwed up  when a bush or a rubio or a kasich gives their usual wormy response about pathways to citizenship  the public most clearly knows that not a single one of them has the basics right they go back to trump who is there hammering home deportations and walls  so by pushing depth and breadth of issues and ignoring the basics  this field facing trump really do not get the mood of this public obama has so royally screwed up  that we can no longer count on basics these other candidates could stand to learn from trump and drive home the basics more they could stand to learn from reagan who was a master at educating the public on the basics of free market v socialism  until it is clear any candidate has the basics seared into their brains and knows what their marching orders are from their boss  the american people  trump will still draw off votes with the basics  and the public will ignore depth and breadth issues take that wind out of his sails and a harder look at depth and breadth is in order ,conservative,news,1455652717.0,1.0,0.0,4763.0,10169.0,0.0

not only is it not a  perfect example  of a free market  it s a really bad example we do nt pay for what we consume  so there s nothing keeping costs in check the fda artificially inflates the cost of drugs  so we have situations where people can charge  100 per pill when the same drug is available overseas for 5 cents per pill when i did nt have insurance  i got medications from overseas pharmacies for pennies on the dollar  yet unfortunately  that s technically illegal  a better  but still not perfect  example of free market health care would be lasik and cosmetic surgeries  where people actually look around for the best price this signals to surgeons and medical device manufacturers that they need to be as efficient as possible as a result  things like lasik are getting much better and cheaper ,libertarian,news,1455659748.0,12.0,0.0,2476.0,10819.0,0.0
it s true that there are certain market inefficiencies that exist one example is skewed distribution of wealth that results in some people not being able to afford important goods or services like healthcare  the question must be asked though  is the market inefficiency worse than the government inefficiency  to use the threat of violence to confiscate resources from each other to reallocate towards the priorities of the majority  in this case govt healthcare   comes with great costs as well  the answer to this question can only come from study of history to see which markets and societies have enjoyed the greatest levels of prosperity  i believe that most people in this sub have observed that the greatest levels of prosperity  including the highest quality and quantity of medical care provided  have been in the countries with the greatest respect for individual liberty  many countries have failed to provide even moderate levels of care because they trusted the collective to allocate society s resources rather than the individual for example  during the cuban revolution  high quality universal healthcare was among the highest priorities of the government large amounts of resources were committed to healthcare and in some ways  the population benefited in the short term however  the sacrifices that came with the loss of individual liberty and respect for private property were great the productivity of the country fell and ultimately the level of care  and general quality of life  was not as great as it might have been  tl  dr   in practice  respect for individual liberty leads to better healthcare outcomes than socialism  ,libertarian,news,1455673487.0,2.0,0.0,441.0,1976.0,0.0

i think the whole thing blindsided gus it was nt just that walt murdered two drug dealers with his car  it was also that the dealers had killed that child they hired i do nt believe gus ever meant for them to do that when he said  no more kids   he would have wanted jesse to approach him so he could deal with his employees himself after all  even if gus could nt care less about the child  having his drug dealers commit that murder drew a huge amount of media and law enforcement attention it was a dumb move  period but instead  jesse went after the drug dealers and walt killed them boom more media and law enforcement attention gus had to be furious and a bit overwhelmed  i feel like he probably thought of walt as a safe bet walt is a family man  a teacher  and dying of cancer he s apologetic and collapses under pressure if i were gus  i d never expect walt to go out and run over two drug dealers walt proved himself to be unpredictable and dangerous by doing that therefore  he was a risk gus did nt care to take any longer  gus understood walt s pleas to protect jesse  i think the fact that he met with jesse and heard him out when jesse planned to poison the drug dealers speaks to that jesse at that point was nothing to gus but gus understood he meant the world to walt he gave jesse a chance  and even told him that walt was the only reason jesse got that chance  i do think gus understood walt s reasons for killing the dealers to protect and support jesse but i also think that was nt a factor in whether walt was to live gus had gale  who was thoroughly innocuous  sweet  and consistently loyal gale knew the recipe walt  on the other hand  had just shown his volatility which is the last thing gus needed if he wanted to stay hidden in plain sight i think he decided to have walt killed not because he could nt understand why walt killed the dealers  but because walt  like victor a few episodes later  had become a liability ,breakingbad,television,1455078161.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,5962.0,0.0
there may have been more to motivate walt than just altruism by keeping jesse in his corner  he was close with the only person who might  theoretically  be able to replace him as a cook this gave him leverage over gus that he would not have with gale as an assistant ,breakingbad,television,1455061301.0,1.0,0.0,307.0,48779.0,1.0

gus s reaction to walter s actions in halfmeasure  murdering two of his dealers to save jesse  are to kill walter at the first opportunity as long at the cook can continue without him if anyone could understand walter s actions should nt it be gus who lost his best friendpossible lover to the cartel setting up a 20 year revenge scheme  up until the flashback introduction of max  gus seemed emotionless and i assumed he just did nt understand the loyaltyfriendship between walter and jesse but after that it seems like a real blind spot for him to care so deeply about max to the point where he d betray his employer and yet not understand walter s feelings about jesse and what he d do to protect him ,breakingbad,television,1455057654.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,479.0,0.0

i think season 5 is well done and makes sense visavis the rest of the series  but i personally did nt enjoy it as much because it had fewer light moments and comic relief also  jesse  who could be counted upon in previous seasons to be somewhat of a funny character  totally declined in the last season again  his decline and fall made sense but it was nt as fun to watch also  previous seasons had walt struggling with his own moral decline  and in season 5 he seems to be more of a complete psycho totally makes sense  but it s harder to watch season 5 is also interesting in that the audience is once again put in a strange dilemma of disliking skyler and rooting for walt  especially in the scene where he has the nearaly 10 million dollars in the barrel on the driveway and tells his family they have to run for it  but skyler grandstands and closes this particular window of opportunity the audience may find themselves saying   who does this hypocritical bag of garbage think she is  after all the selfserving things she s done  now she wants to climb on the moral high horse again   her facial expressions and gesticulations during the argument were also  i believe  carefully orchestrated to make the audience hate her and want to slap her  and then question their own priorities because walt himself is a murderous  psychotic monster really effective filmmaking  yet uncomfortable to watch ,breakingbad,television,1454540730.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,0.0

in the season 2 episode  abed s uncontrollable christmas   when searching for the meaning of christmas abed discovers it is actually a lost season 1 box set although it is just a metaphor for a lack of payoff in the show and in abed s mind  it also makes a good metaphor for community as a whole  in lost and community a group of damaged strangers end up stuck somewhere they do nt want to be but end up working together to overcome the obstacles and adventures they face throughout lost and community it is revealed that all of these characters are connected through their pasts and it was destiny that they ended up where they are  season 4  wherein harmon got booted from the show  saw the beginning of problems for the show  and it was widely hated by fans lost also faced this problem in it s 4th season facing the writer s strike  the season was cut down and also marked a low point for most fans it was also in this season of lost where some of the survivors finally made it off the island  much like jeff finally leaving greendale mirroring this  jack  the leader of the group in lost  and jeff both soon experience their lives falling apart when they try to get back to what they were before this leads both of them back to where they originally did nt want to be in both season 5 s along with reuniting the remaining members of the groups both shows saw problems in the real world that resulted in the loss of characters on the show and altered plot lines notably pierce and troy in community and mr eko or walt from lost  which brought in new characters on both shows to fill in the gaps  both shows end with season 6  for now   and fans of both will say that the quality of both fell over the last three seasons fans of both will also argue about the quality of the last seasons as well  including the finales in the end of both the remaining characters come together and move on together for the most part so in that box in season 2  abed found the answer to his quest  but he also found a clue to what the rest of his series would be like   a lack of payoff  while both shows do have their problems in their second halves  i do think they are both worth it and great television ,community,television,1454471559.0,8.0,0.0,796.0,1067.0,0.0

i  m using a classic who rewatch  dw on youtube and lots of big finish to see me through the drought and i  m going to some local dw cons since others have talked about bf i  ll talk about youtube and dw cons  youtube has a lot of dw trailers  short clips  minisodes  parodies  webisodes and fan films the quality and style varies but many are quite good sometimes the production values aren  t the best  but the plot or acting makes up for it older productions are closer to the classic style and are often lacking in sets and special effects later ones are closer to new who in style and use contemporary filming and production techniques and values search out your favorites and build a watch list  dw conventions are another thing to try there are likely to be some within a reasonable travel distance medium size ones like awesome con and wizard world feature multiple sci fi shows with some dw actors and panels they usually are held in convention centers in multiple cities smaller ones like long island who and  re  generations focus on dw actors and panels they offer a more up close and personal experience they are often held in a single city at a large hotel venue both size cons are a lot of fun and while not always cheap  unless they are close by   what you spend on a con and what you get back for it could be compared to a buying binge on big finish  there is also that other time travel show on the scyfy channel  12 monkeys it  s much better than the movie but does require keeping up with the story if interested  i recommend watching season 1 before season 2 starts up in april to get a better understanding of what is going on and there is also the librarians  which  while not really time travel  is loosely styled after dw and there are rick and morty reruns  as they are not doing a 2016 season either  edit  forgot to add legends of tomorrow as another time travel viewing option ,doctorwho,television,1455550344.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,886.0,0.0

i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length ,himym,television,1454901150.0,1.0,0.0,395.0,7822.0,0.0

to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair,himym,television,1455582828.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3735.0,0.0

i ve heard a lot of folks talking about the various aus from the season 5 finale  but most seem to focus on the crystal war i think we re overlooking a  huge  one  though the nightmare moon timeline  so  here s the aus we see in the episode   crystal war timelineponies locked in an endless civil war  changeling timelineponies driven to the brink of extinction    by changelings  nightmare timelinewe ll get to this in a minute  tirek timelineget rekt  equestria  discord timelinediscord ruins everything  flim and flam timelineget rekt  again   equestria  apocalypse timelineequestria done got rekt in contrast to all of the above  the nightmare timeline seems rather stable rarity tells twilight that the castle is closed to toursimplying that ponies have both the leisure time and disposable income to go travelling further  nightmare moon says that celestia has been trapped for  years  thus  whatever changes she s had to make to the status quo  equestria has apparently been pretty stable  both rarity and rainbow dash are mean to twilight  but this could be due to the circumstancessomeone claiming to be a princess has charged into the literal royal palace  after visiting hours are over  their brusqueness is  at least  understandable  same goes for nightmare moon s obsessive desire to hoard magic  in addition to her inborn jealousy  she was banished for 1000 years using powerful magic  it s would be natural for her to want to keep  powerful  magic out of the hooves of the common people  so  friendship is replaced by fascism  but otherwise  not much has apparently changed personally  i find this au the most interesting of the seven presented  and i would love to see a little more of it  in fanfic  etc ,mylittlepony,television,1455681696.0,6.0,0.0,209.0,316.0,0.0

so  i m in my first viewing of voyager  and i have to say that this is probably one of the funniest episodes i have seen so far  there are other pure comedy episodes but this one takes the cake the doctor is such a lovable character  looking for parmac  spelling   in all the wrong places  our man bashir  little green men  that episode with barclay in tng when he goes  james bondish   bride of chaotica  mmm those come to mind right now  i m certain there are others  but this one is just 45 minutes of grinning and laughing with a few  serious  moments to catch your breath  and i like it when star trek goes out of its way to make something lighthearted and fun amidst all the starfleet protocol  so anyway  season 6  and i have to say that voyager is way better than people make it out to be  it does have its problems  but if you are watching a series about a starship that can travel faster than the speed of light  a few extra shuttlecrafts or writers with hangover once in a while should not be your main focus  he caracters are great  just like every other series  even when they start very lame and unlikable  they grow on you a lot  even neelix  for example  piccard s1e1 was a dick  tucker s1e1 was generic texas boy  bashir uggghhh  even the sisko  you get the idea  anyway  i m getting close to complete the whole voyage  but looking forward to july and even more to 2017  llap ,startrek,television,1455665751.0,14.0,0.0,5229.0,4619.0,0.0
it took me quite i while to get into but i ended up enjoying enterprise  not quite as much as the others but still some good memories that is  when i wasnt getting angry at the forced love plot  with trip and tpol or the blatent and obscene sexing up of her character unlike many i enjoyed the long arch of the expanse  anyhow enough on that for now what else can scratch the trek itch  i havent gotten through all of ds9 yet mainly because i found the religious stuff hard to palate but if i got through all of enterprise s trangressions i imagine ds9 will be tame in comparison  what else is there non trek  since ive watched them all now apart from the remainder of ds9  i am trying babylon 5 again since it has alot of rave reviews and high sci fi cred from all ive read i dont expect super special effects but the show is so low budget i find it jarring and hard to get into i saw an episode with some ant creature and it was star trek original series bad and the sets seem so cramped it gives the impression of being filmed in someones backyard garage i will keep trying with it though maybe things smooth out  i mean tng was filmed before that by quite a few years and nearly always looked classy  i have been trying battlestar galactica but after a few episodes that seems like quite a mockery of the genre and grotesquely overrated i feel everything in life has continued to go downhill after the millenium everything was gold in the 80s and 90s  andromeda looks to be a sleeper hit i have on my rader  so what say ye all you star trek stalwarts  what will satisfy my yearning heart ,startrek,television,1455571146.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-2.0,0.0

it always seems to be a rule to slow to impulse when you re in a system my guess is in crowded areas with many other ships or gravitational sources  the risk of getting your warp field disrupted is higher it could also be a precision thing stopping on a dime at warp 9 and then being in orbit can be problematic  making sure you do nt run into a planet or a achieve a stable orbit  if we believe the new movies  a warp field can be sustained under the gravitational force of a black hole  and without warp cores   but coming out of warp is coming out blind which could result in you coming out into a debris field ,startrek,television,1455392758.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5542.0,0.0
in a nutshell  impulse power is used for sublight travel and warp is used for ftl speeds as far as i know  impulse power is not capable of achieving any ftl travel the quote from  star trek vi  the undiscovered country  is most likely a writing error  but i m sure explanations have been conceived of  in regards to  best of both worlds    star trek  has always been wildly inconsistent about its use of impulse versus warp power when in a star system dialogue has established multiple times that ships should travel at impulse power when in a star system for safety concerns however  visually  we see ships going to warp all the time when in a star system even worse  kirk and crew jump to warp in the   atmosphere   of earth in  star trek iv  the voyage home  ,startrek,television,1455392426.0,3.0,0.0,661.0,8512.0,0.0
there is no downside beside the shift in quality and style  but i did nt find that to be a problem either when it was initially broadcast or on a recent chronological rewatch there is a small amount of overlap  and voyager s pilot episode involves it being at ds9   but it s fairly minor background elements that wo nt make much of a difference  i prefer the broadcast order because i like those extra bits and you get the same context the production team expected  though you ca nt  really  go wrong with either approach ,startrek,television,1455396219.0,1.0,0.0,2419.0,80021.0,0.0
impulse power is highly inconsistent with measurements like  14 impulse  apparently measuring 14 the maximum output of a given vessel s impulse engines rather than a measurement of speed  14 impulse from a shuttle is very different from 14 impulse from a starship  the star trek voyager technical manual lists full impulse as 14th the speed of light if we assume that the enterprised engines have the same capability  although theirs may be slower or faster   then dropping out of warp around the orbit of neptune would put the ship  45 billion kms from earth  at full impulse  14 the speed of light   wolfram alpha says it d take 60042 seconds  or 1001 minutes  or 1668 hours which is nt too bad dropping out of warp closer to saturn  4725 hours  or jupiter  233 hours  would shave a considerable amount of time off that estimate  of course  tos has scotty saying that the romulan ships use  simple impulse  but still have interstellar capabilities  tl  dr  it s not clear,startrek,television,1455398094.0,2.0,0.0,12255.0,115613.0,1.0

let s just say  it s up to the screenwriter and plot   generally speaking  warp is between stars and impulse is between planets  however  we ve seen way too many instances of ships dropping out of warp conveniently right next to the planet they re going  and so on like in st  id  enterprise conveniently dropped out of warp right next to earth  if i remember elite  there are actually four drive systems the regular engines you fly around in  and combat with   the microjump that lets you travel forward a bit until you get too close to someone  jump drive to take you to another star system  depending on your fuel range   and galactic jump drive  take you to another galaxy    ,startrek,television,1455419994.0,1.0,0.0,3500.0,9520.0,1.0

gay characters are fine i just do nt want their sexuality to be constantly spotlighted it should be as subtle as anyone else s sexuality they should just be a regular freaking person if they have a relationship with someone of the same gender  it should just be a regular thing it should nt be a big deal the whole thing should just be completely normal and not given any special attention in this way  we can see these characters the same way we see anyone else it was a big deal to have a gay character on tv in the 90s or the 00s it s time to make it as transparent and ordinary as it was to have a black captain or a female captain do nt focus on it or highlight it just have it be a normal thing i  definitely  do nt to watch a show with an antigay crew member so we can continue this ridiculous debate of whether or not we should treat gay people like normal people just make it obvious that by the 24th century  nobody will give a single shit about which gender you re making out with ,startrek,television,1455375688.0,2.0,0.0,96.0,3307.0,0.0

the timelines are always affected in the same way  whether there is a loop or an alternate universe what is shown to the audience is simply a matter of perspective so yes  in the  prime  universe the enterprisec goes back to their own timeline and creates the loop that we accept in the canon  prime  timeline  but there is also an alternate universe where they do not return to their time it simply is nt shown to the audience because the loop is what defines the  prime  timeline  as uhmsbountya said  it s up to the writers  but i think that the distinction between different forms of time travel is moot when you look at the big picture that does nt mean this is nt an interesting  wellresearched article  just that there are a lot of semantics involved when the reality is that every possible timeline is occurring and not occurring simultaneously and the only people who define what is and is not part of the  prime  timeline are the writers  which is a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise interesting thought experiment ,startrek,television,1455300936.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,0.0

i keep on saying this but this show is really good so far i really love how this show takes an idea and just takes it everywhere it can go it really appeals to me and i am really enjoying watching the next thing that they explore i feel like i have a lot to say this time around so let s get to it   redemption  part ii not really as good as part 1 but some solid battles and data got time to shine pretty cool   darmok very good it finally helped me understand the universal translator and it was a really solid view at language and culture exchange that kept an interesting core to avoid being dull   ensign ro i know the bajorans become important later and this was quite a good intro i had a hard time following the actual plot but ro was nice and it was saved by her character   silicon avatar the plot took a long journey before discovering what it was but what it was  was pretty damn good the story of revenge and the federation neglecting someone like that was very interesting and the ending was bold   disaster great character episode some cool and unusual pairings and great dialogue plot was ok too  i guess   the game while i did nt particularly desire to see wesley again this episode was nice and creepy but i ca nt say it s a new favourite of mine  either   unification very nice i liked seeing spock and the plot kept itself engaging throughout got slightly weaker when sela showed up but overall it was very well done and picard had a lot of great moments   a matter of honor i mean perspective i mean time certainly watchable but him being a conman was a bit obvious i liked some interactions between rasmussen and the crew but overall it was rather dull the actual problemsolving and picard s dilemma was really solid though   new ground not being a member of the fandom i do nt know what people think of alexander i think i quite like him the actor is really bad  but i like the way he acts as a foil for worf and he certainly brings something new to the show now the episode itself was pretty standard and only really got good during the ending   hero worship this was a fun episode  if a bit low on substance the child actor was  again  not that great but the episode was just a nice bit of fluff and there was some nice data scenes in there   violations well this episode was weird little actual plot and it was about rape overall i was nt that engaged but i did nt hate it either   the masterpiece society terribly dull it was way too much like a tos episode and troi romances seem to be doomed to be boring and unbelievably dumb but i did like the morality discussions quite a bit and that part was quite nice   conundrum really solid i liked the concept and the characters are explored from a whole new angle ro and riker have surprisingly good chemistry and the mystery aspect was well executed   power play the actors probably had a field day with this one and the possesed people did a bangup job of playing hose roles as for the actual plot i found the enterprise caper a lot more engaging than the old ship stuff and the ending did nt give me much but i ca nt say i dislike it   ethics great drama  if a bit soapy worf was very much in character but the real interesting stuff was between crusher and ellen degeneres  android clone ellenbot 3000 really did show the varied nature of people within the federation and she provided a different viewpoint in a believable way i mean you know they wo nt kill off worf but it was pretty nice to see him walking at the end   the outcast really good even if it does play it pretty safe in some areas the concept is interesting and wellexplored and the ending is wonderfully horrible  reminiscent of the city on the edge of forever i really liked soren s character and her and riker had a very genuine chemistry  maybe jonathan frakes just has chemistry with everyone   cause and effect loved it the looping was really well directed and executed and the plot got the concept across  while still moving forward and the characters got a chance to figure out a mystery   the first duty we are not allowed to forget wesley apparently but again  solid episode and putting a former main character in this morally wrong position and having picard absolutely fuming was a very bold choice and it gives some interesting insight into starfleet everyday   cost of living uhhhhhhh i did not need an alexandermama troi episode in my life i did nt get the holodeck scenes  alexander is kind of a twat and i was just not engaged surprisingly my favourite thing about it was lwaxana s relationship with her husbandtobe and the stuff around that   the perfect mate i feel really bad the episode is almost too good at presenting the metamorph character and the ending made me feel like shit the scenes with kamala and picard were fantastic  but i ca nt say i cared much for her scenes of seducing various men but as a concept episode it was pretty great what  there were ferengi in this episode  huh   imaginary friend more fucking children please stop doing this forever tng i was constantly groaning during this episode it mixes horrible child acting  the cassandra truth clich   a particular pet peeve of mine   and a moral issue that really did not need to be explored why did they make this   i borg absolutely fantastic it develops the borg in a great way and the various characters  response to everything was great prejudice  individuality and lot of interesting points are explored and hugh was great to see develop geordi got a chance to shine and the ending was kind of sad  but still ambiguous enough to be slightly hopeful   the next phase really liked it  the mystery was cool and the concept was well explored and the funeral planning and data stuff was just sweet as hell and i m really starting to love ro   the inner light  aka the one were picard becomes jorel  well that out of the way this one is popular and i mean i liked it it was great as an exploration of life and picard got some really good stuff i wanted to see the episode develop and the ending was absolutely great i can see why people have a fondness for it   time s arrow  part i love it data is wonderful as a french inventor and i am really excited to see where it goes i did nt care much for the alien stuff but people s reaction to the data death stuff was very nice looking forward to part 2   now

michonne  i think most of us are expecting glenn andor daryl to die soon and i think we re all open to the possibility of the demise of morgan and carol especially abraham  but if there s one character who i never worry about  because i know she wo nt die  is michonne there has nt been a single scene where i ve feared for her life whereas i m on my toes every single time glenn is on the screen  i love her actor but i just do nt feel like the character is justified enough to be given a free pass she s the badass samurai sword woman past that  she has had some development with rick and carl  as well as carrying a new sense of hope she never had in season 3 but i do nt feel this is substantial for immortal status the sword makes the woman  she is  truly  the one death that will actually shock everyone to the core ,thewalkingdead,television,1455634865.0,16.0,0.0,683.0,1189.0,0.0

i think the michonne character will have a surprising development but i see her sooner as rick s new love interest than as a surprising death think about it andrea is dead maggie has glenn and michonne has been like a mother to carl my guess is that morgan will be killed off the show focusses on his refusal to kill what better way to sacrifice yourself by offering your life  still keep your convictions and teach rick  and maybe carol  a lesson about not having to kill everything,thewalkingdead,television,1455661128.0,1.0,0.0,548.0,221.0,0.0
michonne has been through so much everyone has  i get that  it s the zombie apocalypse and everyone s life has turned to shit but michonne her story really hits hard for me  though i ca nt particularly 100  relate to it  even there s just something so numbing about it she s lost everyone she held dear her boyfriend  best friend  her son and making her boyfriend and best friend into zombie slaves  i always thought that was so badass  but really  it was a thin layer she held onto so she did nt have to completely let go a place of denial when they were  re  killed  she lost it all  i know some others have lost everything  too carol  she lost her husband  though to be honest  good riddance  and her daughter that must hurt  so  bad she s hardened up and i honestly do nt hold that against her  because it s a rational way to react in a world as cold as the one she s living in  it s dangerous to be kind and have an open heart  maggie maggie lost nearly her entire family at the farm  then her dad at the prison and her sister at the hospital i love maggie to death  and the only thing that makes me feel less like she s lost everything  but please stop showing her crying oh my god it hurts my heart  is that she has glenn and you know  we re all speculating that he ll be dead soon  and if he does  should i say when   i m kinda expecting it but i know i ll still be shocked  then she ll have lost everything  ish  depending on where they go with the baby and all   there are other characters but i do nt want to make this longer than it already is michonne is a beautiful  strong character with a tragic past and we ve seen her open up a bit with carl and rick  and some of the others   which has been heartwarming and has given us a way to see more of who she is and how sweet her personality can be despite the hardships she s faced  and if she does die  oh my god i   will   cry it s something we are nt expecting because she s done so well for herself and others the whole time it truly would shock us all to the core  and that s a shock i do nt want to take ,thewalkingdead,television,1455677978.0,2.0,0.0,444.0,416.0,0.0

okay  so we all hate ron and glad he is dead  but i have a few points on why we should nt be so harsh  he was physically and mentally abused his whole life  and the apocalypse probably made it 10 times worse  rick came in and killed his father  got with his mom  and his son took his girl yes  it may have all been justified  but not to an emotionally ruined teenager  i think many of us would have the same feelings and reactions if we were in his shoes  ron was a tragic figure who s death was guaranteed  but i think we should be a little more rational about him ,thewalkingdead,television,1455661074.0,143.0,0.0,49.0,9303.0,0.0
well that was brutal  great episode with some very good action sequences  loved the montage of characters just swinging their weapons at the screen  but i must say that carl living is another cliche  so we get 3 simultaneous deaths of the anderson family getting eaten alive  and one amazingly satisfying stabbing  and yet conveniently carl lives after receiving a bullet to the eye  have a word with yourselves writers  i m not saying it s impossible or implausible because it is nt but why save all of the major characters in this crazy zombieriddled episode  have some balls it s ironic that morgan is getting more annoying and gabriel is getting more tolerable  bad writing  or is morgan just a complete wank stain   even after his amazing centricepisode  this should have been the midseason finale because the one we got was terrible  but i know why it was nt because there was nt a cliffhanger to lead us into the rest of the season  i still do nt understand why so many people hate rick though  he is bad ass  and actually has evolved over the years 810  carl living brought it down ,thewalkingdead,television,1455576347.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,25.0,0.0
