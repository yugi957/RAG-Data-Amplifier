gt  the series was a huge sensation despite the fact that nothing beyond the first season aired on american television until later the pause was due primarily to censorship issues  cartoons were seen purely as a children  s medium whose audience  according to american broadcasters  could not comprehend advanced concepts such as death or deal with excessive onscreen violence tezuka was personally approached and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this changed even a bit in the last  half a century  we see the same shit even today  and this is too short  i want more  ca nt wait for the next part  we will get into a more familiar territory for us and hopefully we can pick up a show or two from that period ,d01wy1q,anime,entertainment,1455634221.0,Pyrelord,11.0,0.0,24966,114769,0.0

if you read a lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things  check out this anime you ll like what you find  i m martinthedragon  and i thank you for reading ,464r02,anime,entertainment,1455658733.0,MartintheDragon,117.0,0.0,1026,699,0.0

holy fuck what an ending  amuro and char s duel was intense with both their mechs being destroyed kind of sad that the white base was destroyed i was not expecting char to blow off kycilia s head off this episode i was kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing series and i ll look forward to watching zeta gundam with you all ,d02gc58,anime,entertainment,1455661388.0,TreyTrey23,3.0,0.0,413,17147,0.0
i like how amuro casually abandons his favorite gundam when it becomes half useless it s just a robot afterall  i remember he operates the console to set autopilot for the last shooting  but it s not there might be movie or manga addition  amuro notices that zabi is the true enemy  but it s different from char s standpoint amuro is still talking like just a soldier hoping piece  whilst char s motivation is mostly from his personal revenge and he also now finds newtypes are more dangerous  to whom  whole humanity  or himself   so it s understandable they ca nt reconcile and join  the episode title escape is appropriate  besides amuro wanted to confront char clues in white base just fight to survive and escape from a baoa qu alive they are now federation soldier but still have civilian mindset from episode 1  overall i see the last few episodes feeling rushed  but do nt find its openendingness is unsatisfying or i say it is not an open ending  considering the scope of the story is one year war amuro survived the war along with the members of white base  char completed his revenge it is a good conclusion ,d02o8gx,anime,entertainment,1455673446.0,ukainaoto,3.0,0.0,1848,4313,0.0

you know that feeling when you re you re watching a seasonal anime that s somewhere between average and good  and all of a sudden the newest episode blows you away with how great it is  in the twoandahalf years i ve been watching simulcasts  i ve experienced that feeling a number of times and it s always a pleasant surprise unfortunately  not all anime are able to carry that narrative momentum through to the end  so what episodes  whether you simulcasted them or not  stand out as the gems in otherwise average  good not great  or bad shows  some that come to mind for me are  when supernatural battles become commonplace episode 7  i have a feeling this is going to be a popular answer simply due to  hatoko s amazing rant   https  vidme8yy5hatokosrantfrominoubattle   and the biggest crime in the show  is that   s  she loses her memory of it in the next episode and her concerns are brushed to the side   inoubattle is a show that s so close to being great if only it focused more on its strongest elements  danmachi episode 8   the fight   s  between bell and the minotaur was without a doubt one of the best scenes from anime in 2015 it elevated my opinion of the series from being an sao clone to a show that has genuine character development and is capable of heartpounding action   classroom crisis episode 11  classroom crisis got off to a slow start  but it picked up steam as it went culminating in this amazing episode  nagisa s   s  plan completely fails  kaito is asked to help the company build weapons  atech is on the verge of being disbanded  and nagisa is stabbed as a last second cliffhanger so much happens in this episode to move the story to its low point before the triumphant finale  but the scene that steals the show is the kiss shared by nagisa and mizuki the buildup to it is great as nagisa spills his guts to her  as is the cute and touching payoff one of the best kiss scenes i ve seen in recent memory   aldnoah zero episode 12   i remember   s  being blown away when i watched this episode for the first time the action throughout the episode was great and the genuine tension in that last scene was unbelievable the creators certainly achieved their goal of making a memorable cliffhanger too bad the second season wipes away most of the consequences from this episode   charlotte episode 7  oh charlotte it had its faults in the earlier half of the show   perhaps the most boring maedarequisite baseball episode i ve seen  but i was genuinely enjoying it too bad the last 3 episodes had to ruin all that still  charlotte did give us some great things  most notably best girl nao and episode 7   because maeda built up the relationship between   s  yu and ayumi  her death did have an impact both on the audience and on yu it was interesting watching him fall further into depression and revert into his powerabusing self from episode one and just as he s about to cross the line into drug abuse  nao finally beats some sense into him and reveals that she d been watching him the whole time that scene not only brings yu the catharsis he so desperately needs  its a big moment for nao showing how much she cares for him   this is how you do it maeda  not by expecting an emotional reaction out of the audience after a single rushed episode ,465038,anime,entertainment,1455661863.0,FierceAlchemist,32.0,0.0,3499,3456,0.0

first time watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as fuck in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out yet ,d02j182,anime,entertainment,1455665373.0,mmreviews,2.0,0.0,44,4639,0.0

episode 19 of seven deadly sins  nanatsu no taizai   the overall series was just ok and not really anything spectacular  yet i could nt help but notice that the way king s past was interwoven with his fight in the present was actually extremely welldirected the cuts between each span of time illustrated not only king s longevity but also served to drive home the inevitable tragedy  that he would be forced to repeat those same past actions right here and now it s pretty cinematic stuff and not something i was expecting given the decidedly average presentation of the rest of the show ,d02iyku,anime,entertainment,1455665260.0,UltimateEye,8.0,0.0,1,29024,0.0

just curious as to if any one from ranime has gotten in tune with their inner weeb lately  where i live we got over a foot of snow over night i thought it was amazing because i still like snow  sure driving conditions are poor and you have to shovel and plow and make room for your cars and what not  but there is something about snow that makes me feel like a young kid again  i m 25 right now   anyway  so there i am out in my yard where everything looks like a white blanket not too many foot prints  and my drive way had nt been plowed yet it is then that inspiration struck  i took out my phone and started to record i started talking about how nice the snow looked and how quiet everything was  and then when you least expected it  truth be told my acting sucks so it was probably obvious  but i digress  i yelled dynamyte    and dove into the snow ala renge from non non biyori  it felt amazing to do i then shared the video on my fb wall for other friends and family to see  but obviously almost nobody caught the weeb reference  they just thought i was being a goof  anyway tl  dr i did the renge dynamyte jump into the snow today and it made me wonder what sort of weeby things you ranime people have done lately ,464uba,anime,entertainment,1455659886.0,lftenjamin,84.0,0.0,4243,12233,0.0

since i ve watched madoka magica over 30 times  little things about the subs irritate me  stuff like minor grammar errors so i extracted them and edited them  comparing subs from two versions and using my own  very  limited knowledge of japanese to write better subs i m still not completely happy so i ll probably keep tweaking them on each rewatch  other than that  i decided at the end of last year i wanted to learn japanese it was nt specifically because of anime  but the goal of  watch anime without subtitles  helps motivate me i m doing a bunch of different courses  genki  pimsleur  human japanese  kodansha kanji  and a really crappy memrise course  because they each bring something else to the table i already notice i m picking out a lot more words than i did even a week ago  though i m a  long  way away from being able to dump subs ,d02ucue,anime,entertainment,1455683378.0,UncleCyborg,2.0,0.0,24,2315,0.0

gt  a lot of rambling gt   gt   gt   gt   6510   ign  this is one of my favorite series so it pains me to read that your view of the story is so skewed but i think the main takeaway here is that you did nt understand character motivations well they are very well written  but not everything is spelled out for you there is a huge amount of foreshadowing that you likely didnt catch the first time  making it seem like things came out of left field when they really didnt  gt  this show is a shippers nightmare  gt  i really wanted her stay gone or keep her amnesia just for the sake of my pairings and i think you have some bias here being angry when your ships do nt pan out is not a valid objective criticism personally i loved that you couldnt guess who would end up with who in the beginning its way more entertaining that way and i enjoy a good story with twists  gt  also theres stuff about the sea god which is sorta hard to fully explain the plot is kinda flimsy  this really was an integral part of the story and it seems like you didnt quite understand it it s a really unique and beautiful subplot that ties a lot of the events in the second half together  especially the last few episodes i ll admit i didnt really get it on the first watch but after rewatching it i was stunned at the way that it came together in the end  really though i think it comes down to whether or not you like the kind of drama that mari okada writes  like in anohana or sakurasou i really love it and i think it has an emotional element that other dramas lack  i could really gush about this series and i really think it s a masterpiece ,d02nope,anime,entertainment,1455672616.0,_vogonpoetry_,4.0,0.0,3,69405,0.0

about aldnoah zero  i think demolition d put it best it was a show whose overall outline was very much dramatic  suspenseful  and heartbreaking  gen urobutcher   but whose middle parts were filled in quite awkwardly by much less talented writers  etc  thus  we had an attention grabbing start  a suspenseful ending  the the first season   and everything else is kinda just  meh  ,d02mun1,anime,entertainment,1455671357.0,RiceIsBliss,10.0,0.0,2664,19235,0.0
this might be a bit too far from the premise  but i found that most individual episodes of death parade were better than the show itself taken as a whole as in   death parade   s  the stories of the  guests  during the episodic parts of the series were more interesting than the overarching plot    i do nt know i m explaining it right  but that s what comes to mind first for me ,d02pggi,anime,entertainment,1455675309.0,StaccatoH,2.0,0.0,13,1578,0.0

nagi no asukara is ummmwell its pretty  i have alot of gripes with the anime honestly and i was sorta surprised at its mal score of  85 and its imbd 76 so for the sake of this post i ll say what i liked first    visuals   like i said the show is pretty the setting of both shioshishio and oshiooshi are beautiful i especially liked oshiooshi s rusted metal and rural setting the character movement is really fluid  no pun intended  and if you can get over the clannadesque character design you ll be fine    sound   the music has this mystical water theme to it its kinda hard to explain but i really liked it the ops and eds are incredible and fit the show well  i was actually planning on watching this just because of  opening 2   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  inkszyr99um    plot  without the romance    it was okay  i really liked akari and miuna s arc because of how sweet it was but  essentially the whole show is  we re gon na do an ofunehiki  which is nt bad watching the characters come together was really nice the racism between the land dwellers and sea critters was erased towards the end thankfully also theres stuff about the sea god which is sorta hard to fully explain    now thats everything objectively good about the series   this show is a shippers nightmare  so based on the first 13 episodes kaname likes chisaki who like hikari who likes manaka who tsumugu who likes  the sea    its essentially  a freakin chain hikari is so loud mouthed and verbally abusive but he has a heart of gold and can actual think deeply about himself and others manaka is a crybaby thats just as rash as hikari chisaki is super aggravating because she the classic romance character that   refuses to confess   i get that she does nt wan na change the group dynamic  but its really annoying kaname is the same way but at least he starts trying to discuss their issues once the great sleep is about to happen and he openly confessed to chisaki in front of her parents which was really badass  also everyone runs alot  you d think these chicks would join the track team considering how many times they run away crying and running are what you re gon na see alot but considering they re just 14 i guess i ll let it slide  so if you were like me  throughout the 13 eps you were shuffling how to make the pairings work in a way which everyone is satisfied then the ofunehiki happens and ruins your plans so you have to start over since manaka is pretty much shafted for half of the 2nd half and everyone grew up you re pairing was probably this miuna x hikari  kaname x sayu  and chisaki x tsumugu but nooooo manaka has to show up  i really wanted her stay gone or keep her amnesia just for the sake of my pairings and apparently so did the other characters  then there s the bs  i was gon na call them plotholes but nah so its revealed that tsumugu liked chisaki from the get go cuz of some metaphor that she s the sea or something then he says that she liked him even way back then  yeah this caught me off guard  which ca nt possibly be true  but she admits that she did    this coming from the same chick that said  she still loved hikari even after the 5 year timeskip also  manaka is revealed to have loved hikari but when kaname tried to discuss it in the classroom  she fucking runs off saying she  does nt understand     then later on when hikari hugs her she pushes him back really hard yet  she still loved him at that time  its so contradictory  to be honest  if you re not interested in the romance then there is nt much here in terms of story and plot the romance is the essential meat of this show the way they treated miuna was awful  she tried hard but lost to plot also everyone can get ena which is nt really explained at the end but whatever  if i had to give it a rating i d give it a 6510 the characters really hurt this show and the plot is kinda flimsy its not like hanasku iroha or shirobako where the sol is where the show really shines nagi no asukara is heavily dependent on the romance which is nt that great honestly that being said  i still loved the show it was fun seeing how things would pan out    tl  dr   watch the show  its romance is stupid but its still a fun series to watch and its pretty  sorry if my writing seems sporadic ,465ohb,anime,entertainment,1455671267.0,OseiTheWarrior,2.0,0.0,1,2298,0.0

a boy falls in love with a girl  unable to confess  he is gifted with by a deus ex machina with the girl s phone number never minding the strange area code  he immediately calls her  and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well  but  the next day  when he recounts the previous day s confessions to the girl  she only looks at him with a perplexed expression after some investigation  he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with in fact  she does nt exist in this universe at all she is the girl s alternate universe counterpart  who has fallen in love with the mc s own au self  who too is blissfully unaware of her crush  hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest  most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves while the two chase their respective loved ones  drama ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the nature of love ,d01v3tm,anime,entertainment,1455630494.0,Durinthal,91.0,0.0,3603,60710,1.0

like most people probably  i ve got a lot of ideas i think would make for good anime i ve even come up with what i think are legitimately animesounding titles  if you ll permit me to use them    our hisandher harem is nt working out    it s about a pair of childhood friends and current twentysomething otaku neets who try to help each other form harems their idea is  since they re both socially awkward around the opposite sex   he ll  help form the male harem for  her   and  she ll  help form the female harem for  him   what they do nt count on  however  is that real life is nt an anime  and real people have complex personalities and hopes and dreams and desires of their own so even though they successfully manage to essentially form a pair of perfect harems  none of the harem members are falling in love with our protagonists  and worse  some of them are falling in love with each other  it s basically a comedyparody series that ends up growing a heart as the protagonists come to see their desires as resulting from their own social problems and inability to form normal  healthy relationships they start working on those problems and it actually works  they end up going on normal dates  and have a few relationships their wouldbe harem members eventually become good  close friends instead of mere objects of desire  the series ends with one of the protagonists in a long dry spell and the other breaking up with their most recent significant other  but this is nt a sad ending  because they ve improved so much and have this great group of friends  and know they ll find love in the future and are better  more complete people for all their romantic struggles    the classic marraige project   a young man and woman in their late twenties who ve had no lasting romantic success in life decide to try an experiment even though they have no attraction to one another  they ll start a relationship together  and see if love develops  the title comes from the fact that throughout most of human history  marraige was the  beginning  of a relationship you did nt fall in love and  then  get married  you got married  usually for familial or financial reasons  and were expected to eventually fall in love and most did  and society worked just fine it s only in recent times that the idea of lovefirst relationships and  dating  were even considered  and just like the marraiges of old  this one works  too  they do fall in love  though there s lots of ups and downs and one shortlived end to the experiment along the way it s basically a series that examines and questions conventional wisdom about love and relationships  and looks at other ways for people to connect and fall in love that society ignores  i ll post more later i ve got lots of ideas ,d01ufgw,anime,entertainment,1455628876.0,jnb64,17.0,0.0,14396,6262,0.0

here  this is based on a dream i had once  four nameless characters awake on a beach house in a desolate abandoned summer side town one is dressed a policeman  one is dressed as professor  one is a nurse  and the last is a hobo none of them have memories of who they were before  but follow the orders they are given in the notebooks they find next to them they each leave the town and go follow the instructions to their lives most have families or loved ones  and they continue to play the parts that have been written for them they do nt know why  but they re certain that all of this is wrong  the lives they re given are bad illusions  one policeman s son seems to be forgetting his lines  the nurse finds a camera behind a bookcase  the hobo notes that the power lines around town can not possibly work yet electricity is on  the professor finds clear inconsistencies in the lectures he s told to give but none of his students seem to notice  the town is clearly in disrepair and seems to have been abandoned for decades  but nobody seems to notice  every week they agree to come back to the house they awoke in and discuss what is going on  new notebooks appear every episode giving instructions they include character sheets with unusual stats such and jrpg spell titles all four characters begin to have uncontrollable urges  and feel as if their own minds are out of their control the ones who seem to embrace the madness gain stats and powers  the ones who refuse grow weaker and feebler  until nearly reaching death eventually they realize they must kill people in order to survive  the hobo embraces this with no problem  the professor is fascinated by the intellectual challenge  the cop and nurse find it difficult to follow the task  can they discover what is going on and survive until the end  or will they wind up killing each other and wrecking havoc on this nonsensical world they ve found themselves in ,d01wx84,anime,entertainment,1455634180.0,BlueHighwindz,4.0,0.0,1139,333759,1.0

i ve had an idea for quite a while and i ll have to go into some plot points to make it a bit more interesting but here goes  essay incoming  mc is an immortal who has nt aged since he turned 18  he s not a vampire or god but he has a mysterious side to him because of the fact he has to remain 18 for the rest of his life he refuses to get close to anyone in his class because he knows when he graduates  he ll have to switch schools and start again it s the morning of 12th september 1995  mc has just transferred into another school in hokkaido he introduces himself to his class and sits down unlike all the other times however  for some reason mc is tense and uneasy and can not stop sweating he dwells on it when he goes home to bed  he lives on his own as his parents died of oldage a long time ago he has no family left in the world that he is aware of he does nt want a family nor does he care about family he wakes up the next morning  he goes about his daily routine and checks his watch  he s 20 minutes late for school and again he feels tense and ca nt stop sweating  he falls to the floor trying to catch his breath and when he calms down he heads out the door to catch the next train as he s wandering the streets he realizes something is not right he walks past an electronic store where catches the local news being played on a tv  it turns out that during the night  the majority of his village was massacred by a single unknown person mc shrugs it off as he s seen this type of event far too often for it to have an effect on him he shows up at school but alas  a huge number of students were involved in the massacre and the school suspends all activity  as mc is heading out the door to return home he is confronted by a male about the same age as him physically who has a striking resemblance to mc s uncle who should have died 200 years ago with the rest of his family unclelooking character introduces himself as mc s uncle and claims the massacre was mc s fault for not doing his job in the first place at this point mc is completely dumbfounded and a fight ensues between mc and mc s uncle with mc s uncle completely dominating the fight mc returns to his birth place wounded and seeks answers immediately  he enters his father s study that is filled to the brim with books and documents pertaining to mc s  disorder   after many days and nights of researching  mc discovers he and his uncle are the results of thousands of years worth of genetic manipulation and were brought into the world for one purpose  to lay waste to human civilization so that another race can inherit the earth from humans mc disappears completely for 15 years while his uncle roams japan  destroying anything and everything in his path mc returns but to the uncle s suprise  mc has started to age slightly and now resembles mc s father and carries with him a sword not from this world the 2 are pitted against each other as eternal rivals  one is trying to protect the place where his mother and father enjoyed their lives  fell in love and gave birth to him the other is trying to destroy every last trace of humanity that s pretty much where i stand atm  i have a host of new characters that will be introduced i m writing this as a novel  slightly longer than a light novel not as big as a fullon novel basically it s my dream anime and i m just adding stuff as it comes  i do nt have an ending in mind and there s definitely going to be romance since i m a massive fan of romance anime i m currently up to chapter 4 or so where mc has followed his uncle to a school in shinjuku  mc now has an ally  a young man named mitsuo oh and mc s name is nobu  uncle s name is mikio ,d01uzds,anime,entertainment,1455630206.0,HydroJiN,10.0,0.0,350,4527,0.0

1  romance is nt the core of the show  it s character development that is  2  they re young teenagers and are wracked with emotions that needs to sorted the amount of running away they do when confronted is almost hilarious  but they do take them on eventually as their character develops  3  you forget that manaka overhears how chisaki feels about hikari early on with consideration for their friendship  manaka is thrusted with conflicting feelings and simply pushes away hikari for now  4  i would nt say that muina was treated awfully she s the strongest character of them all for knowing her feelings for hikari conflict with manaka  acting on it unlike in manaka s simular situation  and also ultimately accepting that her feelings wo nt be mutual which would be in the best interest for everyone  herself  hikari  and manaka  ,d02ntgy,anime,entertainment,1455672815.0,hullabazhu,5.0,0.0,2078,5084,0.0

i have absolutely zero expertise analysing shots andor camera movements  but this season s erased and grimgar have both grabbed my attention  i m not sure exactly what they re doing but they are definitely doing it well  i m personally content to watch grimgar even if it was a terrible show  plotwise  simply because of that subtle pull the direction has for me  though i do nt think it s a terrible show at all ,d01vp0e,anime,entertainment,1455631775.0,VincentBlack96,22.0,0.0,6,6089,0.0

i think the unusual contradictions we re getting with grimgar is because of the production studio  a1 pictures they mass produce shows  they pumped out 12 shows in 2015  10 in 2014   they re throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and seeing if a few will stick on paper  grimgar wo nt stick it sounds boring but this time they picked a great director but little budget but the execution is great but it s sooooo slow paced that s because a1 only gave the director little material  i m really liking grimgar it s alluring plot is nt everything the world they ve built up and the characters are good enough it s slow but that s what defines grimgar ,d02d1x6,anime,entertainment,1455656962.0,gettothechoppaaaaaa,5.0,0.0,460,17466,1.0
speaking of fanservice  i just noticed that yume was decently clothed in the emotional scene  in a way does nt hide her body  but does nt show it off either  by the way  would other techniques have worked better  for example  in that scene  could the movement of the characters  their sobbing  or movement in the form of rain  be enough to get us through ,d02gxlc,anime,entertainment,1455662235.0,Emptycoffeemug,2.0,0.0,1,3931,0.0
while my talents and training  both formal and informal  lie in the realm of textual analysis  and although this topic would be better served by a youtube video  i still think the topic is interesting enough  and not oftdiscussed  as most discussion on anime revolves merely about plot and characters  the realm of writers but the directors do a lot in a show to decide whether we d like it or not  so i take a look at one of the more noticeable directorial works this season  and a specific technique that keeps appearing within grimgar  my hope for this post  that people pay more attention not just to what happens  but how it happens and is conveyed and hopefully that you d all enjoy it  too  ,d01vfqf,anime,entertainment,1455631224.0,tundranocaps,4.0,0.0,4935,60209,0.0
i think its a sign of nakamura s talent that my mind did nt really grab on to how many pan shots there were in that episode until you pointed it out that goes to show how he intersperses the pan shots throughout the episode so they do nt stand out rather  they flow naturally with the deliberately paced direction of the series  my favorite one was definitely the threepeat tilt up with yume and haruhiro against the wall the way we progressively get closer to haruhiro s face emphasizes the increasing emotion of what he s saying and you can tell they are nt zooming into the same shot 3 times  decreasing the image quality as they get closer like some anime do the third tilt is clearly a new drawing with a different expression on his face ,d027y09,anime,entertainment,1455650176.0,FierceAlchemist,1.0,0.0,3499,3456,0.0

the scene with kujo holding for dear life onto victorique s ring hits me so hard followed with victorique holding onto kujo s pendant i had to stop and take a breath  i thought the transition from victorique s black dress from the first half of the show to the brightly colored ones from the second half were neat at first because i thought it was a  summer is too hot to wear black  kind of thing  but she kept wearing new different colored clothing into winter and so on this episode though makes it clear through the contrast between the two charming monster costumes that the change in clothing was actually symbolic for the change in victorique after she spent a lot of time with kujo i love that  now holy fuck i did  not  remember that  spectacular albert de blois vs cordelia fight scene    https  sakugayshiorgpostshow10041animatedeffectsfightingfiregosickhairkazuhir  that was some seriously jawdropping animation by kazuhiro miwa i guess from studio bones you re almost guaranteed to get some amazing action what a 1010 fight  also nooooo  cordelia      ,d02rurr,anime,entertainment,1455679097.0,TehVict,1.0,0.0,2728,16060,0.0
random trivia that i forgot to post on the thread of episode 2  araki actually considers kakyoin s first name to be tenmei  instead of noriaki  despite the latter being his official name this is because of a communication failure between araki and his editor stemming from the fact that the kanji can be read either way ,d02na0q,anime,entertainment,1455672009.0,SilverRook,6.0,0.0,1,8295,0.0

new day  new episode of jojo _the ride never ends_ this old lady looks creepy  holy shit  looks like dio also has a harem and he just killed a hot 2d grill what a waste  the fear of seeing dio fills you up with joy sure  ofc the op starts right after a shocking moment like that  ok  so i swear i ve heard this ding sound effect before  and i m pretty sure it s just a common one anyone can use  since i remember it specifically from xcom 2  oh god  that bug has a mouth inside a mouth like it s straight out of alien or something  this tower of gray guy sounds like a terrible person ruining the lives of so many with these  accidents   more ora ora ora ora oras     oh god  why  that was brutal  feels weird to remember that this is a japanese series  so they need to explain english words to the audience just in case they do nt know it but this begs the question why the bug wrote in english  lel  what an old geezer also  i call bullshit on that chop no way you can make a guy unconscious like that  looks like kakyoin wants to take all the glory for himself this episode  nvm lel looks like he got rekt  oh shit  never mind looks like tower got rekt instead he was rused  rip bug and evil old man the world is a better place without them  i can handle most of jojo s bizarre bullshit  but them being able to woo women instantly is pretty unrealistic tbh how are they able to do that  yet speedwagon ca nt  how can he talk without a tongue  i like how joseph is shocked to hear he will be landing the plane i mean  we all remember how good he is with planes from that last part  tbh jotaro  it never is joseph s fault that the plane is crashing  hot cola sounds super disgusting tbh how do you even come up with such a weird combination  i m liking joseph more and more he stands up to this food injustice his american ways have moved my heart   same  same tbh jotaro  how is kakyoin so well versed in the world and its mannerisms  oh look  it s one of the guys in the op lem me guess  he is also gon na be an enemy to jojo s crew  and then become an ally  that food looks disgusting oh god  china seems to be a terrible place for the visual nature of cuisine  _menacing_ a clock made out of fire  but what moves the hands  jojo pls  this bullshit is too hard to swallow  that screenshot of the day made me realize how wiggly kakyoin s hair looks like ,d02lbmh,anime,entertainment,1455669013.0,randomdudeman12,13.0,0.0,99,10326,0.0

i m guessing there must have been a production office suggestion box of ways to keep tanabe and hachi apart  and it was all but lampshaded here  still  now that they ve taken one step forward  i wonder how long until hachi s sensei kicks the bucket  to mix metaphors   especially considering this is a limited ensemble effort  one thing i think planetes does well is character continuity for example  clare remains affected by temara s detention  and fee knows yuri well enough to comment on the change she s noticed  albeit offscreen   little things which sound simple to pull off  but they re even easier to cut for time  or to simplify down to an implication rather than a whole scene incidentally  i d say there are 5 starring  characters at this point  hachi  tanabe  yuri  claire and fee   but i would nt be surprised if there are other opinions ,d02dmq5,anime,entertainment,1455657730.0,contraptionfour,4.0,0.0,1,1298,0.0

example  so i really like god eater  the description from myanimelist   set in a postapocalyptic japan in the year 2071 the world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the aragami an organization known as fenrir was made to exterminate aragami using god arcs   weapons made from aragami cells those who specialize in exterminating aragami are known as god eaters their god arcs originally could only keep a single form  however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and blade form since then  they have been classified newtypes and the previous as oldtypes  oh wow  special monsters that can only be killed by special young adults with special powers now i m sure with enough generalization you boil any anime down to a vague and unoriginal sentence  so what i m asking is for anime that you really enjoyed despite you personally looking at the description and thinking  there is so much originality here it must have been written by someone who s lost their hopes  dreams  imagination  and spirit  edit  also anything with the description  normal guy does normal things until suddenly mysterious hot girl appears ,466410,anime,entertainment,1455677202.0,CaptainBenza,4.0,0.0,2225,36141,0.0

i definitely think panning shots and in general  direction that involves the camera moving more often than not is a trait of western television as you said in the essay  there can be many uses for this technique to draw attention to fanservice  give multiple views of how characters feel in one moment and the most utilised one in my opinionto keep the audience s attention now when i say it like that  it does sound rather negative and to a degree it is this form of direction displays how the average person these days ca nt stay focused on television series  that being said  i do in fact like this technique still it has the ability to liven up scenes that would otherwise be dull and uninteresting with no movement keeping the viewer engaged is important and even though i do nt like how our attention spans seem to be decreasing  this is a good way to keep the audience s attention where it should be grimgars director is doing a splendid job in this regard especially considering how slow paced the series is ,d01wfz9,anime,entertainment,1455633285.0,cycle112,11.0,0.0,866,7845,0.0

might sound stupid but what i mean is if i watch an anime where i try out both sub and dub first and enjoy them equally  i would alternate them every second episode so for example  episode 1 i watch it in sub  then watch it in dub in episode 2 and then back to sub for episode 3 and so on this was the case for me with fullmetal alchemist  brotherhood since i thought both versions were excellent  so what are the benefits and downsides to this  well you get to appreciate experiences of both versions and you get the best of both worlds when a particular character voice you like exists in a specific version same goes for narrative scenes where one of them might be better in a another language the downsides could be that it might hurt your immersion with the anime series  it does nt affect me honestly  when listening to a specific language also you might miss some details or moments in a certain episode that you did nt watch  through that version  when alternating  so has anyone of you tried doing this especially when an anime has both great dubs and subs  otherwise  what do you think of the idea in general ,465124,anime,entertainment,1455662199.0,IcarianStyles,2.0,0.0,255,1784,0.0

9th from mirai nikki she literally came up from the bottom after losing her parents and surviving on her own in the middle east she s also a demolition specialist and killed a lot of innocent people  which is why i was iffy about her at first  she got more and more awesome after she lost her eye though her backstory with 4th s assistant and  her   s  almost death scene was pretty sweet seeing her make a sacrifice so easy and pretty much beating some sense and strength into yuki right before   the kick ass fight scenes she was in toward was pretty awesome too she went through a lot even after becoming an  angel or something   overall  she s just a cool character that i m glad ended up being on the  good  side in the end ,d02la4b,anime,entertainment,1455668951.0,HyruleCool,3.0,0.0,14,1812,0.0

is this going to become a yuri show  i mean this anime does have a romance tag on mal and i do nt think i ve seen the mc even hinting at being interested in any of the girls for the girls however  it seems to me that asuka and misaki might develop into something  particularly now with the jealousy thing creating some tension between them  probably not though ,d017awj,anime,entertainment,1455576980.0,oORocketOo,2.0,0.0,1,4544,0.0
every little facial expression misaki showed in the second half of the episode put me on edge there s everything in there  jealousy  at asuka   anger  at shindou for not taking misaki seriously   selfdoubt  misaki does nt think she s good enough despite scoring against shindou   while everyone else celebrates asuka s achievements  misaki is the one who does not step forward  despite being the person who gets asuka to relax in the locker room just before the match  this episode does highlight something else too  asuka s ability to perform well has more to do with the fact that she has little to no prior experience of fc and thus is nt bounded by traditional ways of approaching it  it takes a great amount of mutual trust to convince someone to close their eyes and listen to instructions the way that masaya and misaki did i suspect masaya has been in a similar situation before  i m excited for the next two to three episodes to see how all of this plays out i wonder if there will be enough time to deal with the fallout of this episode and set up for a somewhat satisfying conclusion given that we re already halfway into the season ,d0139m1,anime,entertainment,1455570951.0,Laxaria,42.0,0.0,808,20610,1.0

i feel like the 3 consecutive kicks was fairly reasonable it s not like she copied shindou s moves or anything she just did what she knew how to do all the drawback was exhaustion  and she literally gives it her all reminds me a little of the quote where one move practiced a thousand times is better then a thousand moves  pretty fun  though misaki s feeling a little down  because of the difference ,d01a8dg,anime,entertainment,1455581640.0,PrinceRazor,5.0,0.0,17,1297,0.0

they fucking skipped nana s bath scenewtf  other than that  it s a pretty normal training episode nothing really out of the ordinary other than the fact that the main three characters seem to all have met each other in the past when they were littlewhich  actually  is a pretty standard subplot i actually thought nana was entering a takeru route for a second there  but of course notboo  i liked this episode just for the reason that we have rivals that we do nt have to hate no one is a dick or a douche  and they re all just genuinely nice and helpful i can handle a character like yuri from last episode  where he has this outer layer of having thorns  but inside he just wants a good run these guys today made it so much easier to watch the episode  next weekwell  we re going to see more cocky  douchey runners  i guess at least we got to see a relaxing episode better to taste a bit of sugar in between  rather than eating bitter stuff right after another ,d020lak,anime,entertainment,1455640054.0,ss_lmtd,20.0,0.0,3309,51154,0.0

i m actually kind of disappointed that asuka could almost pull out a win against shindou she might me a prodigy and all  but she seems to pull out those crazy moves out of no where  even her teammates do nt expect her to be that good asuka was also exhausted before the match but still almost beat shindou  the  king of kings   misaki vs shindou was better imo we could see that he went easy on her and she still lost  but in good fashion i mean he is a pro after all  so students who just started this sport competitive should struggle against him  and it was really disheartening to see misaki after the match it probably sucks to put so much work into something you love and to be overtaken so easily by someone who just started and could nt even fly before  still an enjoyable episode  since the matches are still fun to watch it s just that i did nt like how strong asuka has become in such a short time ,d013i6e,anime,entertainment,1455571296.0,scrublord3,6.0,0.0,1,485,0.0

i definitely think panning shots and in general  direction that involves the camera moving more often than not is a trait of western television as you said in the essay  there can be many uses for this technique to draw attention to fanservice  give multiple views of how characters feel in one moment and the most utilised one in my opinionto keep the audience s attention now when i say it like that  it does sound rather negative and to a degree it is this form of direction displays how the average person these days ca nt stay focused on television series  that being said  i do in fact like this technique still it has the ability to liven up scenes that would otherwise be dull and uninteresting with no movement keeping the viewer engaged is important and even though i do nt like how our attention spans seem to be decreasing  this is a good way to keep the audience s attention where it should be grimgars director is doing a splendid job in this regard especially considering how slow paced the series is ,d01wfz9,anime,entertainment,1455633285.0,cycle112,11.0,0.0,866,7845,0.0
i have absolutely zero expertise analysing shots andor camera movements  but this season s erased and grimgar have both grabbed my attention  i m not sure exactly what they re doing but they are definitely doing it well  i m personally content to watch grimgar even if it was a terrible show  plotwise  simply because of that subtle pull the direction has for me  though i do nt think it s a terrible show at all ,d01vp0e,anime,entertainment,1455631775.0,VincentBlack96,22.0,0.0,6,6089,0.0

i think the unusual contradictions we re getting with grimgar is because of the production studio  a1 pictures they mass produce shows  they pumped out 12 shows in 2015  10 in 2014   they re throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and seeing if a few will stick on paper  grimgar wo nt stick it sounds boring but this time they picked a great director but little budget but the execution is great but it s sooooo slow paced that s because a1 only gave the director little material  i m really liking grimgar it s alluring plot is nt everything the world they ve built up and the characters are good enough it s slow but that s what defines grimgar ,d02d1x6,anime,entertainment,1455656962.0,gettothechoppaaaaaa,5.0,0.0,460,17466,1.0
you failed to mention something very important with panning shots of still or low action scenes in anime  it massively reduces the amount of key frames which must be drawn grimgar is particularly bad in this regard  with respect to costcutting  not quality  as there are a lot of musiconly scenesmontages which also cut costs on voice acting ,d02boe3,anime,entertainment,1455655131.0,Renalan,4.0,0.0,7681,39399,0.0
speaking of fanservice  i just noticed that yume was decently clothed in the emotional scene  in a way does nt hide her body  but does nt show it off either  by the way  would other techniques have worked better  for example  in that scene  could the movement of the characters  their sobbing  or movement in the form of rain  be enough to get us through ,d02gxlc,anime,entertainment,1455662235.0,Emptycoffeemug,2.0,0.0,1,3931,0.0
while my talents and training  both formal and informal  lie in the realm of textual analysis  and although this topic would be better served by a youtube video  i still think the topic is interesting enough  and not oftdiscussed  as most discussion on anime revolves merely about plot and characters  the realm of writers but the directors do a lot in a show to decide whether we d like it or not  so i take a look at one of the more noticeable directorial works this season  and a specific technique that keeps appearing within grimgar  my hope for this post  that people pay more attention not just to what happens  but how it happens and is conveyed and hopefully that you d all enjoy it  too  ,d01vfqf,anime,entertainment,1455631224.0,tundranocaps,4.0,0.0,4935,60209,0.0
i think its a sign of nakamura s talent that my mind did nt really grab on to how many pan shots there were in that episode until you pointed it out that goes to show how he intersperses the pan shots throughout the episode so they do nt stand out rather  they flow naturally with the deliberately paced direction of the series  my favorite one was definitely the threepeat tilt up with yume and haruhiro against the wall the way we progressively get closer to haruhiro s face emphasizes the increasing emotion of what he s saying and you can tell they are nt zooming into the same shot 3 times  decreasing the image quality as they get closer like some anime do the third tilt is clearly a new drawing with a different expression on his face ,d027y09,anime,entertainment,1455650176.0,FierceAlchemist,1.0,0.0,3499,3456,0.0

hey  sorry i missed yesterday s thread i m so excited to watch through this  and very thankful for you hosting this  pittman  so thanks    sora has already won me over with her determination and resolve  she will do anything to make her dream come true  and now she has to prove it  she even earns the respect of those who were against her  and even gets acknowledged by layla  layla really does seem quite diabolical  but i m sure it wo nt go on without being explored and dug into perhaps she too holds kaleido stage so dearly that she would nt want it s reputation tarnished by those with no experience  i look forward to seeing more of her  and to seeing the whys of her actions  kalos is great  and his interactions with sora have been very funny  i do nt think he s a perv i hope he seems to have big hopes and exceptions for sora  he clearly sees something others do nt good guy kalos  i love   dio   fool  the spirit of the stage  i really was nt expecting this kind of twist  but i really do enjoy and appreciate the little supernatural twists in otherwise normal circumstances ala dera in tamako market it just adds some spice  sora s hard work and guts are making this a great watch so far i m really enjoying the comedy the exaggerated iconography in anime has nt grown old for me yet  which kaleido stage does very well  and interactions between sora and fool have been hilarious to watch i look forward to more what i m most hopeful for and looking forward to is seeing strong bonds of family and friendship form between the cast as we go on  the animation feels very similar to both gintama and cardcaptor sakura in many ways  and looking at anime news network there seems to be a number common key animators  but it only credits them for certain episodes i think the similarities are pretty uncanny though any one else think this  or can confirm or deny any common key factors  thanks again pittman  for hosting ,d02gmqo,anime,entertainment,1455661802.0,Sajamba,4.0,0.0,7474,43569,0.0

first time watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as fuck in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out yet ,d02j182,anime,entertainment,1455665373.0,mmreviews,2.0,0.0,44,4639,0.0

i m guessing there must have been a production office suggestion box of ways to keep tanabe and hachi apart  and it was all but lampshaded here  still  now that they ve taken one step forward  i wonder how long until hachi s sensei kicks the bucket  to mix metaphors   especially considering this is a limited ensemble effort  one thing i think planetes does well is character continuity for example  clare remains affected by temara s detention  and fee knows yuri well enough to comment on the change she s noticed  albeit offscreen   little things which sound simple to pull off  but they re even easier to cut for time  or to simplify down to an implication rather than a whole scene incidentally  i d say there are 5 starring  characters at this point  hachi  tanabe  yuri  claire and fee   but i would nt be surprised if there are other opinions ,d02dmq5,anime,entertainment,1455657730.0,contraptionfour,4.0,0.0,1,1298,0.0
