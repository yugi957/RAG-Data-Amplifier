he wrote the script himself  i m wary of anything todd mcfarlane writes after his interview with the comics journal  mcfarlane  yeah  i  m  uh  i just don  t  i  you got me pinned in the corner here  because i don  t read  and you  re right  it is kind of funny that i  m a writer you know what i mean  groth  yeah  mcfarlane  more than that  though  it  s kind of frustrating to writers out there  groth  or irksome  mcfarlane  because  then  either it doesn  t really fucking matter what people write  then  because if i can do it  and i can sell 1000000 copies with bad writing  then what the fuck is the problem  that brings us to the argument  then  that maybe the artwork is more important  that  s a whole  nother discussion then  at that point  groth  or maybe most comicbook readers don  t care about the writing  mcfarlane  then i  m going   ok  they don  t care about the writing  perfect then  it  s a good thing that i  m a better artist than writer right now  then  i mean  the fates are looking down on me even when i don  t try  i seem to somehow succeed i  m ignorant on a lot of things  but i think that i  m somewhat wellbalanced in life  such that i  ve been thrown into a kind of a fame and fortune  i  m a fuck  let me tell you about it  but you know what  the kids never see that side of me when i  m in front of the kids  because they  re the most important thing to me  i  m a pussycat i owe my life to every single one of those kids that buys my book i don  t care if they  re 8 or 28  or 88 it  s the readers that i owe everything to i don  t give a shit about the fucking other people that are along the chain they exist because  ultimately  because of those kids the distributors can think that they  re doing something that  s grand and whatever else  and they are  but they wouldn  t even exist if people didn  t want comic books the retailers are doing a great job and i love them but they wouldn  t be selling comic books if the kid didn  t want to buy comic books now  somewhere down the line those kids are buying the comic books  so when they react to my stuff  and i read my mail  if i make any changes  it  s from the fan mail   i think  todd  that this character  s a little bit too dark and morose for us  i think he  s too happy  i think he  s too fat  i think he  s too wide   i react to those kids  because they  re my buying public editorial people  or anybody else along the way says   todd  don  t make them fat   why   just because  that  s not a good enough answer to me right now in my life the kids  unfortunately  when they  re sitting there going   he  s too fat  because he looks like a little lump of    they  ve actually got a reason why they think he  s too fat nobody else along the chain has it  so  i  ve been thrust in a position where i can either be a fuck or an ignoramus i can play any game that anybody wants me to play i think that i can play them  somewhat  with whatever skill that i have i should have been an actor i think i perform very well but i also know that i  m not good at everything that i do i  m better at other things but i don  t think that  just because i  m not good at somethings  that i  m not good at being a writer  that i should have a better writer on my book  groth  but if you respect writing  and you respect your audience  wouldn  t you try to make yourself a better writer  mcfarlane  uhhuh  groth  but you don  t read anything  mcfarlane  no  i don  t read anything  groth  so how can you make yourself a better writer if you don  t study writing and read other authors  mcfarlane  maybe there  s my ignorance there  because i don  t think that if i read shakespeare i  m going to become a good comicbook writer  groth  well  i don  t either  resigned   mcfarlane  i don  t know what you want me to read i mean  if it  s technical stuff  you  re going to have a tough time  because unless it  s got pictures  i can  t read black and white  other than the box scores i just don  t have that mentality i  ve got to have pictures in front of me i don  t read comics  i don  t read nothing really i read the sports page  and then the comics journal  i  m going to give you a plug actually  that  s black and white i do read that and whatever else it  s not like i don  t have somewhat of a mild vocabulary out there ,d00t7vv,comicbooks,entertainment,1455556499.0,jlebowski316,11.0,0.0,46,9931,0.0

first  i ll start by saying that this is not the case the implication is that bruce basically abused him mentally and dick lost his mind because of it  but there s nothing sexual about their relationship  second  i d like to address this  gt  i d like to separate his political views from his fiction this is extremely difficult to do with miller  especially in any work of his that was createdpublished in the years following 911  he is by nature a very political artist who infuses his stories with his own personal opinions on politics and society  and dksa is one of his most angry political pieces to date  he was writing it when 911 happened  and you can tell that it takes an extremely sharp turn towards rightwing  libertarian politics around halfway through  as far as i m concerned  tdksa is one of the worst batman stories there is because it s barely even a batman story it just reads like miller using batman to act out his violent  anarchofascist fantasies  stay the fuck away from it if you have problems with miller s particular brand of hateful  racist politics ,d01rxyo,comicbooks,entertainment,1455620742.0,forkinanoutlet,7.0,0.0,2108,69724,1.0

big week with five new books on my list for wednesday     deadpool and cable split second  3    i ve been buying this  but someonw i ve missed it when putting my list together until now i m not caught up on reading it  but that s in part because the book does not come with a digital copy ridiculous considering the  499 price tag     snowfall  1    i like anything with snow even though the postcataclysmic setting of this story is decsibed as a place where  it no longer snows   i m betting from the title we ll see some i m not familiar with the creative team  but i ve heard good things about  great pacific      avengers standoff welcome to pleasant hill  1    no idea what to expect here i m not crazy about all new all different marvel  but i do nt think i m ready to pass on its first big event nick spencer and mark bagley seems like a ca nt miss creative team     extraordinary xmen  7    still not completely sold on this series  but the last issue was an improvement it s going to take a lot to get me to drop an xmen title so i ll be sticking withit for a while     star wars  16    keeping this on my list for now  but i m likely done with marvel s star wars i was nt crazy about  vader down   particularly the characters from the  vader  series  which is a shame since it started out strong i ll take a look at this in the store and see if mike mayhew s art changes my mind ,d00q1fp,comicbooks,entertainment,1455551572.0,ptbreakeven,9.0,0.0,938,5941,0.0

it seemed like as the comics developed a devoted monthly following they began trending toward longer storylines since the 60s the stories became increasingly decompressed to the point that in the early 00s with stories created to be immediately ready for the graphic novel market  or massive crossover events   very few comics were interesting in small doses anymore but if you re willing to go a little further back into the 80s and 90s  you can find that some of the best comic stories ever made were in the 46 issue range you re talking about   born again   death the high cost of living   books of magic   marvels   kingdom come   red son   dark knight returns   batman  year one ,d01791b,comicbooks,entertainment,1455576902.0,SJWTumblrinaMonster,0.0,0.0,28,2657,0.0

i read  uncanny  xmen more or less straight through  at least up to the point where it started fragmenting and there was nt a single clear throughline  sometime in the 90 s  that s an interesting run because it s almost all one writer  chris claremont  and a nonhuge number of artists that has two large effects  compared to most longer spans on a series the first is that there s not the shakeup on a series that you usually get when there s a creative team change things tend to stay relatively smooth and consistent throughout  and character development tends to happen pretty evenly  there s certainly places where there s some casting around  trying out different characterizations  but things that stick tend to  stick    the second is that there s a lot of things that pay off only a long ways down the road claremont is really good at either setting things up way ahead of time  or really good at setting up story hooks that can be returned to later if something interesting comes up for them  probably some of both  one of the biggest things that happens over the course of the run is the rise of  and gradually increased centrality of  the big crossover event early on  there are no crossovers  once in a while someone will drop into the book  but there s nothing that s a true crossover gradually  you start getting larger events  although they re mostly things that do nt expect you to actually be reading anything else by the 90 s  not only are crossover events full crossovers  but the interbellum issues are increasingly about building to or reacting to those events ,d01defm,comicbooks,entertainment,1455586697.0,Daiteach,3.0,0.0,439,11111,0.0

i thought it was pretty great there were some kind of off lines but a lot were great loved the after credits gag as well and pretty much the entire movie  edit  loved bob showing up at the end  hope we get to see him some more in the future in general i really enjoyed the movie  that said i think it could have used another fifteen minutes or so to give the supporting cast a bit more time there are a surprisingly large amount of characters in the film and feel like we could have used a few more moments with each of them  though the run time is already at pretty much two hours  2nd edit  actually ended up seeing it a second time with different friends noticed vanessa is wearing wade s coat when she gets kidnapped from when he is threatening the stalker ,czwtg5l,comicbooks,entertainment,1455243647.0,Ronocm13,87.0,0.0,9531,57299,0.0

first things first    there s an aftercredits scene   also  on that note   cable   awesome movie it was much better than i had expected it to be it was funny  tragic  interesting  clever  sweet  cute  sexy  unapologetic the way killingdeath is looked upon can be compared to old norse sagas  which did nt bother me enough to compromise the experience so whatever  the deadpoolish elements4thwall breaking  quipping  gore  rap music  now   etcwere balanced nicely honestly  it s probably what gave this movie its  for me  charming personality ca nt wait for the sequel   cable    god  such a great fucking movie ,czxjjng,comicbooks,entertainment,1455300014.0,iceotop,24.0,0.0,107,1835,0.0
just got back here s a couple things i ve already said  initial facebook reaction  it s exactly what you d expect but surprisingly a little tamer weak story  fun action  most of the jokes are chuckle worthy but none are particularly hilarious 610  would not feel compelled to watch again  talking about it with a friend   yeah but i think for me the biggest disappointment is that it actually wasn  t edgy enough like all of the advertising is all this is gon na be revolutionary and unlike anything you  ve ever seen  and i  m like i  ve seen better action in pg13 movies and you have a lot of dick jokes  i  m just saying this  the deadpool movie talked a big fucking game  and did not deliver and even if you ignore the marketing campaign and hype  it  s still just pretty underwhelming i  m not saying it  s bad  i  m saying it didn  t really leave an impact on me it  s a passable way to spend about 2 hours  but not a great movie  that all said  some good things about it  colossus was perfect he s my favorite xman and the deciding factor for me seeing the movie  and i think they absolutely nailed him  i really liked negasonic teenage warhead  and actually think she was a bit underused  the first act of the movie is really solid  the cab driver was really funny  easily one of stan s best cameos  second only to amazing spiderman  i liked the end credits bit ,czxramx,comicbooks,entertainment,1455310973.0,vivvav,8.0,0.0,106485,239420,1.0
i loved it  beginning to end it was just shy of 2 hours of stupid fun  yet managed to tell an intelligent deadpool story  my wife does nt like superhero movies  and she laughed her ass off through the whole thing and damn  that s how you show colossus  so many great one liners and moments  but the one i lost my shit on was when he was stabbed in the head and saw all the cutesy cartoon characters dancing around vanessa s head ,d00firu,comicbooks,entertainment,1455519836.0,falconear,2.0,0.0,2320,34330,0.0

i m getting a sense that because daredevil took kingpin down last season it caused a chain reaction of fisk s underlings fighting for control of his properties in a bid to become the new kingpin in that process punisher s family were killed leading him to  snap  upon learning why all of these gangs have suddenly gone into chaos he sees daredevil as the root cause of his family s demise with a twisted sense of logic  elektra s subplot will most likely be about her trying to convince matt to abandon hell s kitchen and leave his two friends to die at punisher s hand and instead travel with her around the world to become the new leader of the hand beside her  bullseye will also be operating in hell s kitchen as a second subplot who dd has been trying to track down and stop since the end of fisk s reign however bullseye constantly alluded him  and then in the end it ll all collapse on top of mattdd when elektra brings the hand in to kill his friends anyway to force him to go with her and the punisher figuring out the hand has been working behind the scenes and was the group that got his family killed not one of fisk s gangs the teamup of the century then occurs with punisherdd vs elektra amp  the handbullseye ,d00x5cu,comicbooks,entertainment,1455562169.0,TLKv3,14.0,0.0,1230,97748,1.0

i agree with the criminal recommendation they are all stand alone stories and you can pick them up in any order  i recently read nick fury war gone by  by garth ennis and goran parlov i think it might be around ten issues long  but it s a true master work and reminder to why ennis is one of the greatest writers around  if you like shorter stories  i recommend picking up some of the comics by the norwegian artist jason he tells 40 to 50 page stories that always seem to pack an emotional punch ,d015mj8,comicbooks,entertainment,1455574432.0,Vertmovieman,1.0,0.0,1,94,0.0

i had a lot of fun with it i appreciated that whenever confronted with the opportunity to make a tighter   better  movie or indulge in gratuitous  whatever  they went with option b  also  it was great to see colossus onscreen that actually looked  behaved and sounded like colossus granted  they exaggerated his principled  tolerant nature to serve as a strong contrast for deadpool s deadpoolness  but it was refreshing to see an xman show up on screen so reflective of the source  edit  also  was that last setpiece a wrecked helicarrier ,czwxmg9,comicbooks,entertainment,1455249829.0,adamsorkin,117.0,0.0,1239,4946,0.0

hey rcomicbooks i wanted to kind of pick everyone s brain  or whoever is willing to respond  at least  about your thoughts on wooden comic book boxes  i do some woodworking  and am considering making some wooden boxes to store some of my more valuable books in i of course have many standard cardboard short boxes  but thought using wood for the more valuable one s so there s more support and security  ie from impact   my question is about the necessity of putting some kind of padding on the inside do you think that would be necessary  by nature  cardboard boxes have a tiny bit of give to them  so while not necessarily  padding   it s not as stout as wood  anyhow  i thought i d hand it over to you guys for your thoughts one final piece is that  of course  the books will be bagged and boarded  thanks for any insight ,460knf,comicbooks,entertainment,1455593828.0,backmask,4.0,0.0,2077,14368,0.0

i went in excited for this movie  but also expecting daniel waypool with a bit more mainstream humor and yes  there was plenty of it  but it seemed to work better as a live action performance  than in a comic book format  and i loved the sprinkling of side characters like bob  al  and weasel jokes did occasionally fall flat  but this movie did the best thing a movie could do for me  and that was not only entice me to go to a theater to watch it  but entertain me enough that i did nt look at my phone once throughout it to see how much was left ,czxm5i6,comicbooks,entertainment,1455303610.0,aco620,1.0,0.0,13184,81391,1.0

i liked the movie if you like deadpool as a character the movie is pretty much for you  dunno what else you re going to expect so go and watch it  things i didnt like  1 the villain he was just a poor villain he was vanilla as they come  if his name wasnt francis he could just a random dude whos good at shootingsword fighting and evil  2 the originmedical experiments scenes were a little not that great in my opinion  it was trying to be tragic but it kinda wasnt at the same time  in my opinion they should have gone full to tragedy to make us feel bad for wade  but it was in the middle somewhere maybe it should have been more psychological torture in that he would have lost his sanity and made him into the deadpool we know etc plus is he a mutant in the movies now  3 kinda wish we saw more of the evil henchmen chick  gina carano  really dug the 4th wall jokes though  i could tell a lot of audience members were nt expecting it and it seemed to make them laugh quite a bit excited for d2 ,czxyh2h,comicbooks,entertainment,1455322636.0,Prathik,8.0,0.0,59182,54804,0.0
very enjoyable  i m generally not a fan of violent movies  in an over the top sort of way  kickass was too much  but general violence if used to enhance a story is okay   but i found deadpool did a great job of mixing humor into almost every single prolonged sequence of violence to take the focus off the terrible acts and make me laugh my way through the counting bullets gag in the first sequence was a great example  the comedy was genuinely funny tj miller s lines regarding his face were wonderful  although i was disappointed we got so little of him and their relationship the  i d come with you  but i do nt want to  line was great as well al being in the movie was a great shout out to fanboys  as well and their arguments about ikea were absolutely hysterical ,czx9qbi,comicbooks,entertainment,1455284934.0,blackertai,10.0,0.0,1509,46489,0.0
my biggest takeaways from the movie  1 a lot of jokes work that absolutely should nt  driveby made me gut laugh  despite the premise of hashtag jokes being run into the ground this speaks a lot to the perfect casting and the comedic timing of ryan and tj it ll be fun to see if the same jokes hold up in subsequent viewings  2 ever since i heard reynolds  and dps name together in the same sentence  i knew it was the absolute perfect match the only thing that could have messed it up was horrible writing that strayed too far from the spirithistory of the character luckily  this was not the case  and they completely knocked it out of the park in fact  they referenced so much source material that even the most ardent fan could miss a lot of it  3 this was really the perfect way to tell his origin story chop up the really depressing parts  and distribute them throughout the funny they did nt sugarcoat or glance over the depressing parts though either the cancer diagnosis and his reactioncoping were gut wrenching the torture was visceral as hell  and i could nt help but wincing  4 i m glad that they mostly ignored the wayera schizophrenia angle when paired with the constant breaking of the fourth wall  i could really see how it would have been confusing i mean  poolovision made an appearance  but it was done about as tastefully as you could do anything relating to deadpool  5 the barrier to entry on some of the jokes was high  but i love that the writers did nt aim for the lowestcommondenominator it s probably my biggest issue with most comedy movies today  and they did a great job of spreading the love between the lcd and the diehards  6 titties and gratuitous sex were great  but it made for some incredibly awkward viewing when you re sitting next to a mother and her 810 year old children not the movie s fault  i know kinda ruined some moments for me though haha  edit  only regret is that bea arthur was nt around to make a cameo having betty white do a review of the movie was pretty fucking amazing though  rating  810 great writing  perfect casting  and a real dedication to deadpool fans who wanted to see this done right only gripe is that i wanted to be longer ,czxfxgc,comicbooks,entertainment,1455295046.0,countingconflict,24.0,0.0,1003,4268,0.0

i m getting a sense that because daredevil took kingpin down last season it caused a chain reaction of fisk s underlings fighting for control of his properties in a bid to become the new kingpin in that process punisher s family were killed leading him to  snap  upon learning why all of these gangs have suddenly gone into chaos he sees daredevil as the root cause of his family s demise with a twisted sense of logic  elektra s subplot will most likely be about her trying to convince matt to abandon hell s kitchen and leave his two friends to die at punisher s hand and instead travel with her around the world to become the new leader of the hand beside her  bullseye will also be operating in hell s kitchen as a second subplot who dd has been trying to track down and stop since the end of fisk s reign however bullseye constantly alluded him  and then in the end it ll all collapse on top of mattdd when elektra brings the hand in to kill his friends anyway to force him to go with her and the punisher figuring out the hand has been working behind the scenes and was the group that got his family killed not one of fisk s gangs the teamup of the century then occurs with punisherdd vs elektra amp  the handbullseye ,d00x5cu,comicbooks,entertainment,1455562169.0,TLKv3,13.0,0.0,1230,97748,1.0

david brothers is cool  comics is better for him being a part of it one of my fave stories is that scott snyder said  when brothers was editing wytches  brothers called him out for doing that formulaic  someone once said  framing device in nearly every one of his comics  how did snyder not realize that until wytches   the article was really irritating though paul lai inserts his view into the interview while claiming not to it s fine to do that  just do nt say you re letting someone s answers go  unvarnished  while you do  stop trying to make  spectrum age  work if it sticks  it will be the most selfcongratulatory name ever as if there were only golden books in the golden age but now  we have a spectrum you do nt name the age while you re in it all this while he claims he agrees with brothers that we ca nt be self congratulatory when is comes to diversity i like that brothers immediately suggests the interviewer is nt very original with the spectrum age idea  that the mindless ones blog uses the prismatic age as their descriptor to me  that may be more informative and nuanced than spectrum age time will tell  also   shattuck blvd   no cred anyways  do nt want to hate or nitpick  though that s what i ve been doing  i suppose lai got an excellent interview from brothers  i just wish he did nt use it as a platform to bolster his arguments and make it seem like brothers s ideas were his first at the end ,d01t5uu,comicbooks,entertainment,1455625258.0,cherryultrasuedetups,1.0,0.0,1,81,0.0

hey rcomicbooks i wanted to kind of pick everyone s brain  or whoever is willing to respond  at least  about your thoughts on wooden comic book boxes  i do some woodworking  and am considering making some wooden boxes to store some of my more valuable books in i of course have many standard cardboard short boxes  but thought using wood for the more valuable one s so there s more support and security  ie from impact   my question is about the necessity of putting some kind of padding on the inside do you think that would be necessary  by nature  cardboard boxes have a tiny bit of give to them  so while not necessarily  padding   it s not as stout as wood  anyhow  i thought i d hand it over to you guys for your thoughts one final piece is that  of course  the books will be bagged and boarded  thanks for any insight ,460knf,comicbooks,entertainment,1455593828.0,backmask,4.0,0.0,2077,14368,0.0
the gassing off of the wood could prematurely deteriorate the comics  the padding material could as well ,d01jiag,comicbooks,entertainment,1455596439.0,85Brougham_onZs,2.0,0.0,78,9578,0.0
i think padding would be based upon movement if these are literally stack and store with very little to no movement then you can get away with no padding however felt is pretty cheap and makes a decent liner and can be a small bit of padding ,d01i5uc,comicbooks,entertainment,1455594201.0,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1.0,0.0,4785,30863,1.0
try polysuede or felt that is acidfree or passes the oddy test aside from looking nice  it will offer some minimal give  and help to keep everything from touching the wood  wood is  generally  naturally acidic  so keep that in mind make sure you stay away from oak or cedar  as they are extra acidic  poplar  maple  pine are less acidic   stay away from plywood if you are making it a closed box  as the glue will potentially be a concern  be sure to use a good quality water based poly to seal the thing  something from general finishes vs say minwax   that said  it should be fine if you re bagging everything ,d02fswl,comicbooks,entertainment,1455660642.0,mrindustrialist,1.0,0.0,1,75,0.0

i enjoyed it went to a small theater and knew there would only be a few people  3 others lol   a lot of the movie was in the trailer but it s worth it pacing was great scenes were short and to the point just like reading a comic from panel to panel jokes were ok  i laughed out loud a couple of times  but the tone was a perfect deadpool  i wish there was more i feel a little underwhelmed because i was more deadpool the fight scenes were awesome but i wish there was a little more i would have liked to see some amazing fight scenes that were a bit longer  they succeeded because i really want to see the sequel plus i think either  henry rollins   http  iimgurcom48lbxb4jpg  or  stephen lang   http  imgurcomgallery7of5ipf  should be cast as cable i d prefer lang  and that scene where the dude got slammed into the highway sign and went  splat   had me laugh so hard and out loud ,czwvsi2,comicbooks,entertainment,1455247092.0,Techtard,29.0,0.0,13922,6920,0.0

ok i am a big deadpool fan and have been reading him since joe kelly  best deadpool writer imo  was writing him  and i have a tiny bit of authority  no i am not arrogant  i am in fact the humblest man in the universe  to say that  no this current writing of deadpool sucks   this writing of deadpool is really dark whereas deadpool written before was dark but it had humor to bring some levity to the plot and deadpool aka merc with the mouth just says one line one  not oneliner  whereas before he could go into a impromptu speech that was both hilarious and drove the fact home that deadpool is fucking nuts gerry duggan is not a good comedy writer  that being said joe kelly is back to write an ongoing  spidermandeadpool  which is hilarious and fabian nicieza wrote  deadpool and cable  which was amazing and funny check those out but do nt read the main deadpool title it s dark  has no humor  and is pointing out everything that is obvious as if the readers has less intelligence than kurt kobain s garage wall ,d01la0j,comicbooks,entertainment,1455599759.0,Cynical_Dickhead69,-1.0,0.0,65,578,0.0

i had a lot of fun with it i appreciated that whenever confronted with the opportunity to make a tighter   better  movie or indulge in gratuitous  whatever  they went with option b  also  it was great to see colossus onscreen that actually looked  behaved and sounded like colossus granted  they exaggerated his principled  tolerant nature to serve as a strong contrast for deadpool s deadpoolness  but it was refreshing to see an xman show up on screen so reflective of the source  edit  also  was that last setpiece a wrecked helicarrier ,czwxmg9,comicbooks,entertainment,1455249829.0,adamsorkin,117.0,0.0,1239,4946,0.0

i enjoyed it went to a small theater and knew there would only be a few people  3 others lol   a lot of the movie was in the trailer but it s worth it pacing was great scenes were short and to the point just like reading a comic from panel to panel jokes were ok  i laughed out loud a couple of times  but the tone was a perfect deadpool  i wish there was more i feel a little underwhelmed because i was more deadpool the fight scenes were awesome but i wish there was a little more i would have liked to see some amazing fight scenes that were a bit longer  they succeeded because i really want to see the sequel plus i think either  henry rollins   http  iimgurcom48lbxb4jpg  or  stephen lang   http  imgurcomgallery7of5ipf  should be cast as cable i d prefer lang  and that scene where the dude got slammed into the highway sign and went  splat   had me laugh so hard and out loud ,czwvsi2,comicbooks,entertainment,1455247092.0,Techtard,29.0,0.0,13922,6920,0.0

i liked the movie if you like deadpool as a character the movie is pretty much for you  dunno what else you re going to expect so go and watch it  things i didnt like  1 the villain he was just a poor villain he was vanilla as they come  if his name wasnt francis he could just a random dude whos good at shootingsword fighting and evil  2 the originmedical experiments scenes were a little not that great in my opinion  it was trying to be tragic but it kinda wasnt at the same time  in my opinion they should have gone full to tragedy to make us feel bad for wade  but it was in the middle somewhere maybe it should have been more psychological torture in that he would have lost his sanity and made him into the deadpool we know etc plus is he a mutant in the movies now  3 kinda wish we saw more of the evil henchmen chick  gina carano  really dug the 4th wall jokes though  i could tell a lot of audience members were nt expecting it and it seemed to make them laugh quite a bit excited for d2 ,czxyh2h,comicbooks,entertainment,1455322636.0,Prathik,8.0,0.0,59182,54804,0.0
my biggest takeaways from the movie  1 a lot of jokes work that absolutely should nt  driveby made me gut laugh  despite the premise of hashtag jokes being run into the ground this speaks a lot to the perfect casting and the comedic timing of ryan and tj it ll be fun to see if the same jokes hold up in subsequent viewings  2 ever since i heard reynolds  and dps name together in the same sentence  i knew it was the absolute perfect match the only thing that could have messed it up was horrible writing that strayed too far from the spirithistory of the character luckily  this was not the case  and they completely knocked it out of the park in fact  they referenced so much source material that even the most ardent fan could miss a lot of it  3 this was really the perfect way to tell his origin story chop up the really depressing parts  and distribute them throughout the funny they did nt sugarcoat or glance over the depressing parts though either the cancer diagnosis and his reactioncoping were gut wrenching the torture was visceral as hell  and i could nt help but wincing  4 i m glad that they mostly ignored the wayera schizophrenia angle when paired with the constant breaking of the fourth wall  i could really see how it would have been confusing i mean  poolovision made an appearance  but it was done about as tastefully as you could do anything relating to deadpool  5 the barrier to entry on some of the jokes was high  but i love that the writers did nt aim for the lowestcommondenominator it s probably my biggest issue with most comedy movies today  and they did a great job of spreading the love between the lcd and the diehards  6 titties and gratuitous sex were great  but it made for some incredibly awkward viewing when you re sitting next to a mother and her 810 year old children not the movie s fault  i know kinda ruined some moments for me though haha  edit  only regret is that bea arthur was nt around to make a cameo having betty white do a review of the movie was pretty fucking amazing though  rating  810 great writing  perfect casting  and a real dedication to deadpool fans who wanted to see this done right only gripe is that i wanted to be longer ,czxfxgc,comicbooks,entertainment,1455295046.0,countingconflict,24.0,0.0,1003,4268,0.0
copypasting what i said over in rmovies i have only two criticisms of the film 1  it will never be shown on tv outside a premium channel and on demand in the states no way to edit out the language and nudity without ruining the film so now i absolutely have to buy the bluray  2  the burden of knowledge for a lot of the jokes is insanely high green lantern origins avengers some of the xmen films so many brilliant lines that if you have nt seen all those other films you will not get  other than that  film had me laughing do hard i was coughing easy 354 out if 5 the comedy and action were fanfuckingtastic ,czwxlmk,comicbooks,entertainment,1455249790.0,2th,42.0,0.0,15977,271559,0.0

very enjoyable  i m generally not a fan of violent movies  in an over the top sort of way  kickass was too much  but general violence if used to enhance a story is okay   but i found deadpool did a great job of mixing humor into almost every single prolonged sequence of violence to take the focus off the terrible acts and make me laugh my way through the counting bullets gag in the first sequence was a great example  the comedy was genuinely funny tj miller s lines regarding his face were wonderful  although i was disappointed we got so little of him and their relationship the  i d come with you  but i do nt want to  line was great as well al being in the movie was a great shout out to fanboys  as well and their arguments about ikea were absolutely hysterical ,czx9qbi,comicbooks,entertainment,1455284934.0,blackertai,10.0,0.0,1509,46489,0.0

so i m really conflicted with this movie i enjoyed the writing and deadpool s character was done quite well  but i just left it like meh i enjoyed it  especially the handling of his origin and reynolds  acting throughout the movie  but it was just okay all the supporting cast members felt very undeveloped  i walked out of the theater with my friends and we did nt really have much to talk about we all agreed that it was a solid film  and we had no major complaints about it asides from a lack of character development among the supporting cast i got my money s worth from this viewing  but i do nt know if i ll be seeing it again  also  stan lee s cameo was absolutely hilarious ,czwu3jg,comicbooks,entertainment,1455244597.0,kw1nn,11.0,0.0,10095,13271,0.0
just got back here s a couple things i ve already said  initial facebook reaction  it s exactly what you d expect but surprisingly a little tamer weak story  fun action  most of the jokes are chuckle worthy but none are particularly hilarious 610  would not feel compelled to watch again  talking about it with a friend   yeah but i think for me the biggest disappointment is that it actually wasn  t edgy enough like all of the advertising is all this is gon na be revolutionary and unlike anything you  ve ever seen  and i  m like i  ve seen better action in pg13 movies and you have a lot of dick jokes  i  m just saying this  the deadpool movie talked a big fucking game  and did not deliver and even if you ignore the marketing campaign and hype  it  s still just pretty underwhelming i  m not saying it  s bad  i  m saying it didn  t really leave an impact on me it  s a passable way to spend about 2 hours  but not a great movie  that all said  some good things about it  colossus was perfect he s my favorite xman and the deciding factor for me seeing the movie  and i think they absolutely nailed him  i really liked negasonic teenage warhead  and actually think she was a bit underused  the first act of the movie is really solid  the cab driver was really funny  easily one of stan s best cameos  second only to amazing spiderman  i liked the end credits bit ,czxramx,comicbooks,entertainment,1455310973.0,vivvav,8.0,0.0,106485,239420,1.0

he wrote the script himself  i m wary of anything todd mcfarlane writes after his interview with the comics journal  mcfarlane  yeah  i  m  uh  i just don  t  i  you got me pinned in the corner here  because i don  t read  and you  re right  it is kind of funny that i  m a writer you know what i mean  groth  yeah  mcfarlane  more than that  though  it  s kind of frustrating to writers out there  groth  or irksome  mcfarlane  because  then  either it doesn  t really fucking matter what people write  then  because if i can do it  and i can sell 1000000 copies with bad writing  then what the fuck is the problem  that brings us to the argument  then  that maybe the artwork is more important  that  s a whole  nother discussion then  at that point  groth  or maybe most comicbook readers don  t care about the writing  mcfarlane  then i  m going   ok  they don  t care about the writing  perfect then  it  s a good thing that i  m a better artist than writer right now  then  i mean  the fates are looking down on me even when i don  t try  i seem to somehow succeed i  m ignorant on a lot of things  but i think that i  m somewhat wellbalanced in life  such that i  ve been thrown into a kind of a fame and fortune  i  m a fuck  let me tell you about it  but you know what  the kids never see that side of me when i  m in front of the kids  because they  re the most important thing to me  i  m a pussycat i owe my life to every single one of those kids that buys my book i don  t care if they  re 8 or 28  or 88 it  s the readers that i owe everything to i don  t give a shit about the fucking other people that are along the chain they exist because  ultimately  because of those kids the distributors can think that they  re doing something that  s grand and whatever else  and they are  but they wouldn  t even exist if people didn  t want comic books the retailers are doing a great job and i love them but they wouldn  t be selling comic books if the kid didn  t want to buy comic books now  somewhere down the line those kids are buying the comic books  so when they react to my stuff  and i read my mail  if i make any changes  it  s from the fan mail   i think  todd  that this character  s a little bit too dark and morose for us  i think he  s too happy  i think he  s too fat  i think he  s too wide   i react to those kids  because they  re my buying public editorial people  or anybody else along the way says   todd  don  t make them fat   why   just because  that  s not a good enough answer to me right now in my life the kids  unfortunately  when they  re sitting there going   he  s too fat  because he looks like a little lump of    they  ve actually got a reason why they think he  s too fat nobody else along the chain has it  so  i  ve been thrust in a position where i can either be a fuck or an ignoramus i can play any game that anybody wants me to play i think that i can play them  somewhat  with whatever skill that i have i should have been an actor i think i perform very well but i also know that i  m not good at everything that i do i  m better at other things but i don  t think that  just because i  m not good at somethings  that i  m not good at being a writer  that i should have a better writer on my book  groth  but if you respect writing  and you respect your audience  wouldn  t you try to make yourself a better writer  mcfarlane  uhhuh  groth  but you don  t read anything  mcfarlane  no  i don  t read anything  groth  so how can you make yourself a better writer if you don  t study writing and read other authors  mcfarlane  maybe there  s my ignorance there  because i don  t think that if i read shakespeare i  m going to become a good comicbook writer  groth  well  i don  t either  resigned   mcfarlane  i don  t know what you want me to read i mean  if it  s technical stuff  you  re going to have a tough time  because unless it  s got pictures  i can  t read black and white  other than the box scores i just don  t have that mentality i  ve got to have pictures in front of me i don  t read comics  i don  t read nothing really i read the sports page  and then the comics journal  i  m going to give you a plug actually  that  s black and white i do read that and whatever else it  s not like i don  t have somewhat of a mild vocabulary out there ,d00t7vv,comicbooks,entertainment,1455556499.0,jlebowski316,11.0,0.0,46,9931,0.0

i loved cannonball growing up he was this naive country hick who over the years grew up to be the leader of xforce in crossovers they would have him standing right next to cyclops and captain america then they decided to move him to xmen and i was ecstatic i go pick up the issues and for some reason he was just a dumb country hick again ,d0257bl,comicbooks,entertainment,1455646472.0,GoldandBlue,4.0,0.0,3991,235681,0.0
