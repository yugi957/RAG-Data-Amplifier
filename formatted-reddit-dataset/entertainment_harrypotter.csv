yes  i saw a new version of the annotated alice in wonderland the other day  and it s amazing  it s like a huge illustrated version  similar in sizeshape to the illustrated harry potter and the sorcerer s stone   but the actual story is written on like 13 of each page  with extra information and paragraphs and illustrations in the empty parts designwise  it s beautiful  and it s such a cool way to read the book  but it would have to be very wellthought out as far as what information is revealed when  ,d014oda,harrypotter,entertainment,1455573013,whitbeyondmeasure,2,0,44,2320,1.0

i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know ,45znqo,harrypotter,entertainment,1455581228,magic_rhyme,6,0,123,4165,0.0

in regard to your comment about being unable to learn parseltongue  i think it is possible to animal languages at least to be understood by those who are not natural speakers  dumbledore himself understands parseltongue   i d think owl language would be the most useful in the wizarding world it s so natural for owls to be seen about  so they d make the perfect observers and spies ,d01zvc7,harrypotter,entertainment,1455638996,poop_squirrel,4,0,107,8262,0.0
the top comment in this  thread   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments440ppydid_dumbledore_speak_parseltongueczmh7bn  suggests that parseltongues could be magically attenuated to speaking to snakes  however elsewhere on this reddit and i believe jkr herself said it can not be learned we know genetics  of sorts  plays into it some  so are there natural felinetongues  aviriatoungues  rodentiatongues that we do nt know about out there  of course i m asking for wild speculation here as the canon does nt talk about it much and seems to keep parseltongues on par with voldy so no character wants to explore it in the books for fear of being named a deatheater or whatever irrational nonsense comes to mind ,462ivg,harrypotter,entertainment,1455630797,AthosN8,35,0,4977,5879,0.0

all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ,d00vxp9,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560441,palcatraz,4,0,50,34365,0.0

1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had become toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her ,d00vc6k,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559577,trekkie_becky,2,0,5956,33693,1.0

yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  welcome to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place ,d00ruud,harrypotter,entertainment,1455554443,poufsouffle_pants,11,0,1,27,0.0

it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister ,d011ure,harrypotter,entertainment,1455568927,mikkeldaman,8,0,4,20037,0.0

i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with voldemort for a year he could ve easily abandoned himchopped off his right handkill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escapei mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and recklessnot just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuffnot with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministryalthough i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would ve been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time lowvoldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would ve been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrewthe same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human  the world is nt split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gives them depth  5  bonus  i think voldemort would ve made a good gryffindor  his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald,d01iat1,harrypotter,entertainment,1455594420,Mrsphysics,8,0,1,170,0.0

i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you  it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat  harry would have been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7  the hat goes with your choice above all other aspects it weighs in so whoever your 11yearold self believes he or she is or should be  that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i love how it is demonstrated in the movie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride  and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end  i really believe that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you ,d02g2d1,harrypotter,entertainment,1455661009,camicobbs,1,0,1,1,0.0

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments45xv8mchapter_by_chapter_61_the_other_minister    synopsis   bellatrix and narcissa arrive at snape s house narcissa wants to talk to him bella is trying to stop her she thinks snape is a traitor they arrive at his door and snape welcomes them in snape bullies wormtail a bit then bellatrix questions snape about whose side he is on he is able to explain away all her questions then narcissa has a chance to air her worry draco has been given a task by the dark lord narcissa thinks he ll die in the attempt she asks snape to do it instead of draco she makes him swear the unbreakable vow to protect draco and carry out the deed should he fail    poi    bellatrix kills a fox here but she does nt say avada kedavra which suggests that it can be used non verbally given the number of times other people use it and say the incantation  you kinda get the impression that it can only be used verbally but this would suggest otherwise   bellatrix says that snape lives in a  muggle dunghill   but considering that hogsmeade is the only fully wizard village in britain  would nt most wizards live in towns predominantly muggle  unless you live in the middle of nowhere   this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place   spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth and it s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps  we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up  voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius he misjudges the malfoy family they seem to have very little loyalty to him they see him as a sure bet their work for him is all in their own self interest but the minute when it is nt in their self interest to support him  they disobey narcissa here was nt supposed to talk about draco s mission to snape but she does it to protect her son and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this it s a very slytherin trait to protect yourself first   does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore s side  or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord   snape is able to hide his emotions so well but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily  would he be able to conceal his emotions about that  would he betray himself   are snape s parents alive  what happened to them   do you think snape s attitude toward muggles has matured  because i m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father but that seems like something you can mature out of as an adult  you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to has snape rationalised that within himself  or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily  he did nt seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them does he understand that now as an adult   where does the hidden staircase in snape s house lead to  was that an original part of the house   snape being able to boss around wormtail must ve been so fantastic for snape yeah he s not james or sirius but he s one of the next best options and also partially responsible for the death of lily he has to love bullying him   would nt wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form   it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix   do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus   i know most people seem to love alan rickman s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman s snape does nt say much he picks and chooses his words very carefully but the book snape is much more verbose   snape catches bella out here she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort it s a loselose for her   snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore was that voldemort s idea  or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet  because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts   does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job  i presume it s because it s because of the curse on the job more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse   snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore what information did he give  and how does he hide the vital stuff  does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not   if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps  what changes  how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so   snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever   voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour which seems to have both positive and negative consequences i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters   bella says  the dark lord has  in the past  entrusted me with his most precious  and cuts herself off is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault   jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away   snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance so did dumbledore sacrifice her  did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death  why did he pick her  is snape here lying to bella  maybe he s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him   snape is in his element here when he s insulting harry and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him he s so sincere with his dislike of harry he s not putting on any pretence at all   snape talks about dumbledore s greatest weakness that he has to see the best in people now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him now to me  this is a good lie because it s got a fair bit of truth in it but it s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another   how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore  did it affect him at all  or was snape lying here   what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore s injury  how does he tell him how it was sustained   is narcissa a death eater  she was nt at the graveyard when voldemort returned so is she kind ve an associate  an honorary death eater   why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore  would nt it make perfect sense  otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps  does snape actually know the plan here  or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it  he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious    if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others   draco kinda achieved his goal he only really failed at the final hurdle but the end result was the same anyway so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it  lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book so it would seem not   narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite is she just sucking up to him  or does voldemort favour snape most  and why is snape voldemort s favourite  does voldemort see himself in snape   dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer   snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer but when dumbledore actually dies  there s pretty much no need for a spy the order crumbles without dumbledore they have no leadership and they have no initiative it s almost not worth spying on anymore   bella talks about if she had sons do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her  we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord would bella follow the same route  or would she be utterly psychotic   we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow i m kinda surprised that voldemort would nt make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him maybe he thinks it s unnecessary   what happens with an unbreakable vow if there s some grey area involved  not all cases are black and white   in court  they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings yeah it would be a little barbaric but you d get the truth out of people   i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done   the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow  some speculated that snape was on neither side he was just out for himself it was a huge gamble though from snape he called bella s bluff which had to earn him points    quotable quote   well wormtail s

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments445834chapter_by_chapter_538_the_second_war_begins    synopsis   we meet the muggle prime minister he s thinking about all the recent tragedies that have happened a person in a painting coughs and announces the arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet

i would say  1  peter pettigrew in gryffindor  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  2  percy weasly in gryffindor percy was a very ambitious person and i think he could belong in slytherin  3  dumbledore in gryffindor  of course dumbledore is a brave man  but i think ravenclaw or slytherin would suit him more yes  slytherin  think about how cunning and manipulative dumbledore could be even if he did nt look like it dumbledore basically lies to everyone in the series and tries to manipulate everyone from harry to snape to voldemort of course it was all for a good cause  but cunning is still cunning and slytherins are not all evil after all also  dumbledore was quite ambitious in his youth with this whole gryndelvald deal  or however his name is spelled  ,460e54,harrypotter,entertainment,1455591198,ThatGreekLady,26,0,1,895,0.0

gt  fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food  how so  there are multiple instances in the series where they transfigure an inanimate object into an animal  such as when cedric transfigures a rock into a dog when fighting his dragon in gof   by your logic that should impossible  as a violation of the gamp law too i think somehow  magic  is able to tell the difference between food and living animals  gt  if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that  yeah  but it would be fairly obvious if the prime minister started trying to remove the wall people in his office would ask him what he was doing  and when he refused answer  they would definitely think he was going crazy even if he called in a professional construction crew to remove wall  they would still expect to be paid the prime minister is going to have a difficult time explaining why he s spending the taxpayers  money on renovating a building that has no structural issues  gt  fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that  i do nt think fudge cared whether or not harry  forgave  him  i think he assumed that he could bribe harry with the promise of political benefits  such as offering him a fasttrack into becoming an auror   but was ultimately disappointed to learn that harry was not for sale  as he was  dumbledore s man through and through ,d010xce,harrypotter,entertainment,1455567597,tinsmith63,3,0,1,1081,0.0

its hard to tell as there is no versus comparison between most potential title holders due to vastly different time periods you also have to look at given lore and judge how impartial it is for example  most books say harry beats voldemort  which makes him more powerful and yet its obviously not true by the same token  the deatheaters all claim that voldemort was the most powerful wizard ever  yet the order claim dumbledore to be such  going back further  you have the founders  merlin and morgana la fey  let alone all the roman  greek and older contenders for the title  personally  from what i ve read of the hp books  i d wager on it being merlin  everybody uses his name like us muggles swear on god  after all ,d021o8f,harrypotter,entertainment,1455641592,ebpohmr,4,0,1,60,0.0
i ve wondered this before  too in hbp  slughorn and dumbledore do some kind of magic to repair all of the items in the muggle house that slughorn destroyed in an attempt to hide not sure how many of the items are slughorn s and how many are the muggles   and maybe none of them are electronic  but they seem to put them all back together again with no problems  maybe it has to do with the relative skill of the witchwizard and their knowledge of the broken items ,d02dqrk,harrypotter,entertainment,1455657885,poufsouffle_pants,2,0,1,27,0.0

i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know ,45znqo,harrypotter,entertainment,1455581228,magic_rhyme,6,0,123,4165,0.0

i am trying to imagine what severus snape as a headmaster s portrait could do he s relatively young compared to descriptions of the other past headmasters  so i ca nt imagine him taking lots of naps maybe place another portrait of him in the potions room so he can continue teachinglike the history of magic professor who was a ghost  and this gets me on to the subject of these portraits in general and the rules for what the headmasters can and ca nt do in deathly hallows  snape talked to dumbledore s portrait and dumbledore had full knowledge still of everything going down with he shall not be named and the horcruxes  and that snape will notice a time when v becomes more protective of nagini soit appears his faculties are still fully functioning  questions   can headmaster portraits visit other paintings in hogwarts as we ve seen with the knight and fat lady   do headmasters retain full magical knowledge  so for example  had snape gotten new information and shared it with dumbledore  could d have thought about this and instructed snape on what to do  or are the portraits merely messengers or contained to only their previous thoughts ,462e7p,harrypotter,entertainment,1455628760,ruelaurent,26,0,281,84,0.0
the information over at the harry potter wikia  take it as you will  for  portraits   http  harrypotterwikiacomwikiportrait  and  headmaster portraits   http  harrypotterwikiacomwikiheadmaster_portraits  indicates that the subject of the portrait does nt maintain much  if any  memory of his or her life for this reason headmaster portraits tend to be created early on in the headmaster s career and then sit in a cupboard so the painting can learn and retain all of the information the headmaster does  since snape s portrait was nt added  or even made  i m assuming  until after his death  i do nt think it would be a very good representation of snape and it would nt have the knowledge necessary to teach a class unless you taught the portrait potionsbut why would you do that when you could hire real live me to teach potions ,d01xfmt,harrypotter,entertainment,1455635090,MacabreGoblin,14,0,95,191,1.0

i truly think some of dumbledore s decisions were very questionable  specifically    1  huge favoritism towards gryffindor   a  the huge fuck you slytherin in the first book where he basically awards some last minute points to gryffindor  even though the slytherin kids were sure to win he even had to do it during the ceremony to give the poor slytherins hope they would win and then humiliate them no wonder the slytherins hate him  b  sirius tried to murder snape  nope  lets not expel the guy who by the way did nt even stop bullying snape after basically trying to kill him snape was a slytherin so i guess dumbledore did nt care  c  slytherin s head is a dick and a horrible teacher  snape   nope lets keep the guy who gives a bad example to his students just because we got ta  keep an eye on him     2  bad decisions with the staff   a  dada teachers keep dying or horrible things happen to them  lets not just cancel the cursed subject  lets keep putting people s lives in danger b  lets hire that useless trealawney because  we got ta keep an eye on her   c  lets hire snape who is a horrible teacher and a bully to his students because  we got ta keep an eye on him    3  his manipulation and lies   when you think about it  dumbledore always lies and tries to manipulate people he lies so much that it s hard to tell when he s honest he did nt tell anyone about his past  which is understandable i guess   he did nt tell harry about the prophesy until it was too late  he did nt tell harry that he was a horcrux and left snape to do the dirty work  he did nt explain shit to harry most of the time and left him to figure out everything himself he tried to manipulate harry  he tried to manipulate snape  he even tried to manipulate slughorn to make him accept the position of course he meant well  but his brother was right when he called him a liar ,464tka,harrypotter,entertainment,1455659624,ThatGreekLady,4,0,1,895,0.0
there are times i wondered if he bought into his own publicity and had developed a because i m dumbledore  things will work out how i need them to in the end  complex the man was brilliant  no doubt  but i do nt think sanity had been his friend from the time his sister died i think having to put his former best friend down probably finished him off  the problem with devoting yourself to the greater good  is that you tend to lose sight of all the lesser good  that you force to be sacrificed along the way and because you do nt see such as unfair  you forget that to other s they can be just as important as your greater good  for dumbledore  i think the phrase the road to hell is paved with good intentions  could very well be appropriate ,d02fkwr,harrypotter,entertainment,1455660330,ebpohmr,7,0,1,60,0.0
i d like to address this point by point    1  huge favoritism towards gryffindor   a  you re right  this was a dick move  b  dumbledore had a habit of seeing the best in people a lot of people benefited from his benefit of the doubt  not just gryffindors i m not saying his optimism never caused any trouble i just do nt think this is indicative of favoritism towards gryffindor  c  how does this show favoritism towards gryffindor  snape was a dick  but not the worst professor he was a potions savant the pool of people competent enough to teach this subject does nt seem to be very big it must have seemed like an acceptable price to pay for the children to learn from a real potions master    2  bad decisions with the staff   a  the professors who took the dada position were aware of the curse  at least in the seven years we get to see it is a vital subject  and i daresay more lives would be lost by the children not learning dada than one teacher per year potentially dying  remember  they did nt all die   b  to be fair  she was teaching a useless subject and she did need to be kept around if she was just farting around in a shack on the outskirts of hogsmeade  who would ever know about subsequent predictions she made  c  you used this point already    3  his manipulation and lies   dumbledore is a human being he s put on a pedestal by everyone  but he is just as fallible as anyone else he addresses some of the mistakes you mention here and admits his hubris and his poor judgment i ca nt imagine how i would handle telling a twelve or thirteen or fourteen or even fifteen year old child about their truly morbid fate  so i ca nt judge dumbledore for handling it poorly or putting it off ,d02h55j,harrypotter,entertainment,1455662539,MacabreGoblin,2,0,95,191,1.0

i m going to make a lot of assumptions here so please bare with me  being in the order would bring about a lot of intimate information lupin was nt a person to blab what he knows and frankly who would he have talked to with sirius in prison  after lily s death snape would ve been inconsolable who knows how he reacted  probably withdrawing  and maybe even slipping up in front of members of the order because only they would be showing any emotion about the potters  remus is kind  compassionate  caring  and introspective perhaps these qualities couple with a few scraps of information from dumbledore or another member of the order and the out of character  overreaction  by snape  which by most people s standard would be controlled  but for a fellow introvert these signs could be a bit more obvious  of course if remus knows or caught wind that snape s patronus changed and bang  we get that odd sentence structure in the quote  retread it this time with the knowledge that remus is keeping the information guarded either for harry or even snap s sake it s an odd place to pause and he mentions  thinking  as in hypothesizing and using  anyway  as a throw away to move the subject along without dwelling i believe he s just giving a plausible story with partial truth but he knows the truth and is just being a good person and sparing two people a lot of pain and confusion ,d0189ed,harrypotter,entertainment,1455578479,AthosN8,2,0,4977,5879,0.0

or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement ,45vzuy,harrypotter,entertainment,1455534433,AllyUnion,6,0,4,18,0.0

as the title asks  i d like to know which original motion picture soundtrack you liked most out of all eight films if you have several tracks from one album you d like to elaborate on  feel free  for me  i d have to say harry potter and the halfblood prince is my favorite out of all the soundtracks  this ompst has many tracks that i really enjoy listening to   opening  the best opening theme in my opinion  though it has a real tough competitor  lily s theme   the subtle thuds in the beginning  the hint of hedwig s theme  the violins  the chant  then the intensiveness of the second half   the story begins  i really enjoy the tracks that essentially open up  not the film  but the story  eg another story  ootp    it s truly wonderful at the 1  28 mark   living death  as much as this track reminds me of umbridge  there s a mix of several other things i associate this track with luna skipping through the corridors  the da evading the inquisitorial squadfilch  hermione and harry concocting draught of living death overall  this track makes me smile   ron  s victory  i truly love and am fascinated by the sharp  strong  and quick arcos throughout the song the violin work in this track is amazing definitely fits for ron s moment also like the reuse of some elements from quidditch  third year by john williams in prisoner of azkaban   harry amp  hermione  wellca nt say a lot about this track without writing a few paragraphs so i ll keep it simple this track gives off a vibe of hopeless love the harp s delicate strums  the silent violins that crescendo as the harps strums do it also helped that daniel and emma really nailed this scene in the film wish i could say more  but i ll leave this as is   the slug party  the implementation of jazzlike cymbal work is great the track itself is a bit calming and pleasant to the ear hermione trying to avoid cormac in the scene this music was played in was humorous   journey to the cave  right at the beginning you can already feel harry s about to embark on some journey of sorts then the sharp violin arcos and the bass  or cellos  i apologize if i m getting any instruments wrong  begin next  the tempo builds as harry and dumbledore apparate atop a gigantic boulder as the waves are crashing about then the eeriness sets in as the track ends   the drink of despair  wowthis track is immensely emotional the distorted voices  the violins  the feeling they give of endless pain  the huge crescendo near the end   dumbledore s farewell   sigh  whoever listens to this and does nt shed a tear the reuse of chants from opening in a more subtle tone  the violin arcos  the composition of this track is utterly beautiful as the music slowly grows louder  it hits me harder in the feels well done  hooper well done   the friends  along with another year ends  this track incredibly gives off a feeling of moving forward and losing an innocence that was once there this time  the trio know they are about to embark on something extraordinary and the scenery is beautiful in this scene i get goosebumps at the 1  00 mark  well  these were my favorites out of the harry potter and the halfblood prince  original motion picture soundtrack   none of you necessarily have to go all out like i did i d just like to know what your favorite albumtrackscomposer  s  waswere and maybe even why music is a beautiful thing and i m glad there s composers like john williams  nicholas hooper  patrick doyle  and alexandre desplat that make exceptional music and if you ve watched all the films  but never really looked into the soundtracks  i suggest you give some a listen you might surprise yourself at how they are at conveying raw emotion and giving you nostalgia as well as making you remember the scenes throughout the films ,45yi2e,harrypotter,entertainment,1455567797,SicklesandGalleons,2,0,1,0,0.0

it strikes me as something that would be printed in the quibbler with its seemingly nonsensical nature as well as the symbols along the border which is reminiscent of the quirky format the quibbler uses to print dates and times at a glance  it looks to be a mix of alchemical symbols and planetary symbols however i remember reading somewhere about minalima utilizing certain symbols for a lot of their stuff like the quibbler and possibly some book covers as well as articles in the daily prophet i forget what the term was that they used but they did nt call them sigils  seals  or runes  and i think it was nt something specifically belonging to the occult lol  if anyone happens to know which article this is  please let me know xd   sorry  that was very vague but anyway  that symbol on the right just below the  2  and above the  s   is the alchemical symbol for cinnabar  i believe the triangle symbols at the very top and bottom are a little odd looking as they look like the air symbol inverted andor flipped upside down but without the line intersecting through the triangle as it normally would so i m not to sure about that as triangles without an intersecting line are the symbols for fire and water the symbol at the top left corner was listed as  iron vitreol  on one site but i do nt see that symbol on many alchemical charts so i m not to sure about that one the right half of it looks like the alchemical symbol for leadsaturn though all in all  i d say it s probably just a nice page designed to look mysterious and esotericy but if this coloring book page actually did have a hidden meaning  i d be seriously impressed  d,d02535y,harrypotter,entertainment,1455646315,Platycakes,12,0,1,39,0.0

1 i think he had more harryfavoritism than gryffindor sure  he let sirius stay  but he also let draco stay even after his assassination plot nearly killed ron and katie as you mentioned in your other points  there were other bad teachers too that dumbledore kept for his own reasons snape could have ended up hufflepuff s head of house and dumbledore would have kept him  2 so much truth i wonder if he tried to relabel the dada class to break the curse  it did nt work  and he just decided students just had to be taught  3 i think that because dumbledore was such a genius  he always believed nobody would comprehend his plans within plans they could nt keep up with him so  he left them behind only he knew all because only he could comprehend all the moral implications mattered less than the logic  to be fair to dumbledore  he recognized some of his own issues it was nt enough to really change his behavior  but it was enough for him to try and avoid the minister of magic position and to acknowledge that despite his vast knowledge and power  it was harry that had the real power to end things thinking of it in terms of the three brothers fairytale  dumbledore would have liked to be the humble and wise third brother instead  he was the arrogant second brother who wanted to bring back the dead dumbledore admires harry for being what he could not he recognizes his flaws  but ca nt overcome them he deliberately passes the torch onto someone who can  so  he was very  very questionable  but he s also like a greek tragedy i pity him a bit ,d02i5zl,harrypotter,entertainment,1455664040,muted90,1,0,1,288,0.0

interesting theory  i really enjoyed the first few posts in the chain  though i think it goes off the rails a bit towards the end  i had two points to make first  i may be mistaken about the username  but i believe that user datvikingtho implies that slytherin did not put the basilisk there  that riddle did that s absolutely false as jk rowling states that basilisks can live thousands of years  making it entirely possible for it to be placed there by salazar secondly riddle was still an underage wizard when he opened the chamber the first time i would argue he was hardly qualified to train and capture a 50 ft snake monster  parseltounge or not you can argue slytherin had his reasons to be paranoid of muggleborns  but to cast the chamber of secrets as a personal panicroom whose history is slandered by the horribly biased founders is a little ludicrous imo  second  the user psychopompious goes on a gushfest about how amazing slytherin is in the last paragraph and states gt   i think a lot of people forget that slytherin house is more than just selfpreservation too    loyalty is a core value   slytherin  s message is about protecting your own more than nearly anything else slytherin pushes   unquestioning acceptance of and loyalty to your fellows  regardless of blood status    even in harry  s day  according to their welcome message on pottermore  i think that loyalty is hufflepuff s thing mostly  and i think this re appropriation to sytherin is a bit bias and unfair slytherin house is known mostly for their   cunning   and   desire to succeed   than  loyalty   slytherin may not have been a bad dude  but i do nt know if i would paint him as some selfless martyr as she does in the second half of her post  this may be a nitpick  but i wanted to clarify it other than that i thought it was an insightful post  even if it laid the unrequited syltherin love on a little too thick in places for my taste ,d027yam,harrypotter,entertainment,1455650186,Xiber88,9,0,1,1279,0.0

hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time ,45xmfq,harrypotter,entertainment,1455557881,Fuzzylemons,4,0,449,1024,0.0
this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that ,d00v17i,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559134,mjfc893,10,0,23,55,0.0

this is my first post  ca nt wait to be apart of the wonderful world you guys have made here  i first read the series probably five or more years ago  but i ve been rereading them over the past six months or so  and i m always impressed by jk s literary prowess  i just finished  goblet of fire   and i wanted to share an example with you guys of foreshadowing  three whole books in advance   that i only realized my third pass through the book this is the scene towards the end of the book in which dumbledore is questioning harry about what happened in the graveyard it s the part where harry tells dumbledore and sirius about wormtail taking his blood  695696   gt  when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger  however  sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them  gt   he said my blood would make him stronger than if he d used someone else s   harry told dumbledore  he said the protection my  my mother left in me  he d have it too and he was right  he could touch me without hurting himself  he touched my face  gt  for a fleeting instant  harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledore s eyes but next second  harry was sure he had imagined it  for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk  he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him  i m fairly sure that  triumph  is foreshadowing for the end of  deathly hallows  where dumbledore explains to harry that  by taking harry s blood  voldemort keeps harry alive even in his death it s only one sentence  and it s buried pretty deeply in the fourth book  but it shows not only jk s concrete knowledge of the future of the plot  but also dumbledore s knowledge of harry s future and the hope that voldemort s arrogance has created  the books are riddled  ha  with all sorts of examples like this  and they really do show how well jk had the story laid out years ahead of time as a fan rereading the series  these are the little details that make you glad you chose to read again  edit  formatting,45wynw,harrypotter,entertainment,1455550202,ThisCrookedVulture,70,0,82,160,0.0

gt  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  ucavelioness posted this excellent post to why peter in gryffindor was the right choice   he was courageous plenty of times he just did nt have any pride  that is  he did nt mind crying and blubbering and pleading for his life so his words were never courageous  but his actions were almost always physically brave i do nt have the super big list  but here are some of his actions that could be considered brave  stayed friends with remus after he found out he was a werewolf worked to become an animagus without adult guidance the animagus transformation can go horribly  nightmarishly wrong as a rat  ran with three larger animals who could easily have trampled him month after month not to mention there s a shitload of owls around hogwarts  being a rat outside would be very risky  i d say  he was a spy for voldemort for over a year yeah  it s treacherous  but it took some nerve especially once dumbledore suspected a spy do nt forget snape did the same thing the opposite way and for that  harry called snape the bravest man he ever knew  thought fast and ruthlessly and efficiently framed sirius after godric s hollow cut off his own finger without a whimper and coldly massmurdered 12 people  seized his opportunity to escape after the shrieking shack  even though he d been informed that he would be killed if he tried to transform he waited for the right moment and took a gamble with his life  and it paid off  he argues with voldemort when he does nt agree with a plan  and the plan in gof was pretty convoluted and bloated  he speaks up even though he s afraid only gryffindor death eater  only death eater we see do this coincidence  the man cuts off his own hand voldemort was nt forcing him  he was already in the cauldron peter does this alone and of his own violation  he reminds voldemort of his promise after voldemort was reborn  he did nt really need peter any more and could have killed him  and peter knows this  but he still manages a reproachful  you promised   seriously  no one else treats the dark lord anything like this ,d01snpb,harrypotter,entertainment,1455623519,roothyman2,6,0,2283,1396,0.0

the two that stick out to me are dumbledore and hagrid  jk does have a tendency especially in the earlier books to put all the good guys in gryffindor  the bad guys in slytherin  and filler characters in the other houses she tries to redeem this later in the series with characters like luna and tonks but she ca nt change what she had already published  dumbledore and hagrid serve as two sides of the  fatherfigure  for harry at hogwarts  so it would make sense that they were in the the same house as him we also find out their house affiliations in the first two books  where the gryffindorslytherin dichotomy is at its most obvious  both have many gryffindor traits hagrid shows his bravery in situations of crisis like when he s arrested in cos and fights off the ministry officials in ootp but i ve always thought that hagrid would make an excellent hufflepuff he s unassuming and loyal to a fault to the people in his life  especially harry and dumbledore   he s a hard worker  seeing as he has been groundskeeper forever and takes on a teaching position on top of that he has an affinity for magical creatures and the outdoors like many hufflepuffs  although his cooking skills are nt quite up to helga s standards   yes there are moments when he is unpuff  like showing harry the dragons   importantly hufflepuff corresponds with the earth element  and you wo nt find an earthier guy than hagrid he s kind to a fault to students  unless they re mean to him   and often has students to his hut when they re lonely or down  dumbledore has gotten way more discussion in this thread  so i ll say less about him he could ve been a great slytherin or ravenclaw since a lot of people have made the slytherin argument  i ll make the ravenclaw one he s one of the most brilliant wizards to ever come out of hogwarts they talk about him wowing professors with theory when he is a student and it looks like he does a fair bit of independent research while at school he s also a total oddball and those types thrive in ravenclaw he has an insatiable desire for knowledge as well,d02chhy,harrypotter,entertainment,1455656196,pinkducktape8,4,0,66,1336,0.0

my take on why most electronics can not not work in a magical environment is because magic  as a field of energy interferes with the electric field and jams the current or something we see that it takes a great deal of effort to modify electronic equipment before they can work with magic  eg mr weasley s efforts with the car  although how ron could use the fellytone  remains to be explained   so i m guessing that work goes into vanishing all electric related components  such as wires  magnets  circuit boards  and replacing them with some other thing  i would presume magic would be unable to repair electronics  since it stops them from working even when not broken however uelstren suggested  a milimeter mistake means it wo nt work   which suggest it might be a scaling issueperhaps it requires a lot of precision and an ability to move things at a very small scale which most wizards or witches would nt be familiar with in their daytoday use of magic i expect eventually a really bright muggleborn will figure this out and invent a new type of spell that would tap on the electric field itself to achieve the minute changes required to repair electronics  but woah  this is venturing into a whole new area haha edit  added more thoughts,d023nl2,harrypotter,entertainment,1455644361,Rainholly42,2,0,896,2837,0.0

gt  this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place  i think there s a part of snape s psyche that feels he  deserves  to be in despair  as a sort of punishment for allowing lily to come to harm  and also for throwing his lot in with the death eaters in the first place this would explain why he walks around with such a miserable attitude  always wearing a sneer on his face and constantly belittling his students in a pathetic attempt to elevate himself a part of him really believes that he is  supposed  to be miserable  and that s why he brings himself back to his childhood home  the place where he felt nothing but misery growing up ,d02r6ar,harrypotter,entertainment,1455677993,tinsmith63,1,0,1,1081,0.0

it strikes me as something that would be printed in the quibbler with its seemingly nonsensical nature as well as the symbols along the border which is reminiscent of the quirky format the quibbler uses to print dates and times at a glance  it looks to be a mix of alchemical symbols and planetary symbols however i remember reading somewhere about minalima utilizing certain symbols for a lot of their stuff like the quibbler and possibly some book covers as well as articles in the daily prophet i forget what the term was that they used but they did nt call them sigils  seals  or runes  and i think it was nt something specifically belonging to the occult lol  if anyone happens to know which article this is  please let me know xd   sorry  that was very vague but anyway  that symbol on the right just below the  2  and above the  s   is the alchemical symbol for cinnabar  i believe the triangle symbols at the very top and bottom are a little odd looking as they look like the air symbol inverted andor flipped upside down but without the line intersecting through the triangle as it normally would so i m not to sure about that as triangles without an intersecting line are the symbols for fire and water the symbol at the top left corner was listed as  iron vitreol  on one site but i do nt see that symbol on many alchemical charts so i m not to sure about that one the right half of it looks like the alchemical symbol for leadsaturn though all in all  i d say it s probably just a nice page designed to look mysterious and esotericy but if this coloring book page actually did have a hidden meaning  i d be seriously impressed  d,d02535y,harrypotter,entertainment,1455646315,Platycakes,12,0,1,39,0.0

i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with voldemort for a year he could ve easily abandoned himchopped off his right handkill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escapei mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and recklessnot just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuffnot with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministryalthough i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would ve been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time lowvoldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would ve been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrewthe same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human  the world is nt split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gives them depth  5  bonus  i think voldemort would ve made a good gryffindor  his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald,d01iat1,harrypotter,entertainment,1455594420,Mrsphysics,8,0,1,170,0.0

gt  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  ucavelioness posted this excellent post to why peter in gryffindor was the right choice   he was courageous plenty of times he just did nt have any pride  that is  he did nt mind crying and blubbering and pleading for his life so his words were never courageous  but his actions were almost always physically brave i do nt have the super big list  but here are some of his actions that could be considered brave  stayed friends with remus after he found out he was a werewolf worked to become an animagus without adult guidance the animagus transformation can go horribly  nightmarishly wrong as a rat  ran with three larger animals who could easily have trampled him month after month not to mention there s a shitload of owls around hogwarts  being a rat outside would be very risky  i d say  he was a spy for voldemort for over a year yeah  it s treacherous  but it took some nerve especially once dumbledore suspected a spy do nt forget snape did the same thing the opposite way and for that  harry called snape the bravest man he ever knew  thought fast and ruthlessly and efficiently framed sirius after godric s hollow cut off his own finger without a whimper and coldly massmurdered 12 people  seized his opportunity to escape after the shrieking shack  even though he d been informed that he would be killed if he tried to transform he waited for the right moment and took a gamble with his life  and it paid off  he argues with voldemort when he does nt agree with a plan  and the plan in gof was pretty convoluted and bloated  he speaks up even though he s afraid only gryffindor death eater  only death eater we see do this coincidence  the man cuts off his own hand voldemort was nt forcing him  he was already in the cauldron peter does this alone and of his own violation  he reminds voldemort of his promise after voldemort was reborn  he did nt really need peter any more and could have killed him  and peter knows this  but he still manages a reproachful  you promised   seriously  no one else treats the dark lord anything like this ,d01snpb,harrypotter,entertainment,1455623519,roothyman2,6,0,2283,1396,0.0
the two that stick out to me are dumbledore and hagrid  jk does have a tendency especially in the earlier books to put all the good guys in gryffindor  the bad guys in slytherin  and filler characters in the other houses she tries to redeem this later in the series with characters like luna and tonks but she ca nt change what she had already published  dumbledore and hagrid serve as two sides of the  fatherfigure  for harry at hogwarts  so it would make sense that they were in the the same house as him we also find out their house affiliations in the first two books  where the gryffindorslytherin dichotomy is at its most obvious  both have many gryffindor traits hagrid shows his bravery in situations of crisis like when he s arrested in cos and fights off the ministry officials in ootp but i ve always thought that hagrid would make an excellent hufflepuff he s unassuming and loyal to a fault to the people in his life  especially harry and dumbledore   he s a hard worker  seeing as he has been groundskeeper forever and takes on a teaching position on top of that he has an affinity for magical creatures and the outdoors like many hufflepuffs  although his cooking skills are nt quite up to helga s standards   yes there are moments when he is unpuff  like showing harry the dragons   importantly hufflepuff corresponds with the earth element  and you wo nt find an earthier guy than hagrid he s kind to a fault to students  unless they re mean to him   and often has students to his hut when they re lonely or down  dumbledore has gotten way more discussion in this thread  so i ll say less about him he could ve been a great slytherin or ravenclaw since a lot of people have made the slytherin argument  i ll make the ravenclaw one he s one of the most brilliant wizards to ever come out of hogwarts they talk about him wowing professors with theory when he is a student and it looks like he does a fair bit of independent research while at school he s also a total oddball and those types thrive in ravenclaw he has an insatiable desire for knowledge as well,d02chhy,harrypotter,entertainment,1455656196,pinkducktape8,4,0,66,1336,0.0
maybe peter pettigrew would have embraced his inner bravery if he was nt hanging out with james  sirius and remus maybe those 3 looking after him and protecting him all the time  actually made him a bigger coward than he was  because he never got the opportunity to stand up for himself he got so used to them being for him each and every time that he never realized that is not how life is supposed to work this naturally makes him think of saving his own skin than his friends  and makes succumb to voldemort s power who knows  if neville had hung out with the golden trio all the damn time  then he might have never stood up for himself either a little independence will go a long way in building one s courage ,d01xzhb,harrypotter,entertainment,1455636037,Dont_get_too_close,3,0,1,97,0.0
the sorting hat tries to put you where you can find your equals  the hat also knows all the students of each house  so it might take this in consideration harry disliked malfoy from the start  the hat probably saw this  it also knew that sirius and james had already met in the hogwarts train and so on you think voldemort would have turned out good and kind just because he was put in hufflepuff  no  but the slytherin house were the one in which he found his equals  people of ambition and that shared his ideals  so there is no solid answer  sometimes it puts you in a house to balance your traits  hermione was very clever  but gryffindor balanced her somewhat  she certainly did things that she would not have done in ravenclaw malfoy was put into slytherin because he wanted to  he had the traits and etc  if the hat wanted to simply  balance  his personality  then it should have put him in gryffindor for example neville wanted to go to hufflepuff  but the hat insisted and chose gryffindor instead ,d01sc90,harrypotter,entertainment,1455622335,JuniorAL,1,0,1,101,0.0

i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you  it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat  harry would have been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7  the hat goes with your choice above all other aspects it weighs in so whoever your 11yearold self believes he or she is or should be  that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i love how it is demonstrated in the movie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride  and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end  i really believe that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you ,d02g2d1,harrypotter,entertainment,1455661009,camicobbs,1,0,1,1,0.0

i m sure you ve all seen the posts on here or on tumblr about how sad it is that there will be more lupins and potters at hogwarts  but no more blacks well  according to  the black family tree   https  wwwhplexiconorgimagesblackfamilytreesofficialfinalversiongif  there are 3 different blacks that could theoretically have descendants at hogwarts sirius had an uncle that was disowned for giving him money when he ran away  a greatuncle who was a squib and a greatgreatuncle disowned for caring about muggle rights it is entirely possible and even likely that at least one of these gentleman have descendants who could attend hogwarts given that all of these gentleman were disowned it is even possible that they would be blacks more after sirius s heart than his mother s just something i thought people ought to know,45w7tg,harrypotter,entertainment,1455538699,Shandrith,52,0,2752,21181,0.0

politics a look at the way the ministry of magic is run as well as various governments from around the world  both magical and muggle   considering the ministry is such a huge employer and that may students enter the ministry upon leaving hogwarts it seems prudent to give students a detailed understanding of how the government works this would be a newt level course  muggle studies not a new subject but a change in the way it would be taught from 12 year all students who grew up in a magical household  regardless of whether they are pureblood or muggleborn or whatever  would take this class it would teach them the very basics of muggle life how they live etc in third year  you can continue this subject and it would carry one much like it does in the books at newt level is get s much more theoretical and questions mugglemagical relations and things  magical studies the counterpart to muggle studies  this time for students who grew up in a muggle household  regardless of parentage   this would help students get a better understanding of the wizarding world  how laws are created  wizarding pastimes and things that most people who grew up in a magical household  would take for granted the course ends at the end of the second year however it s not very often  once a week or once every two weeks at max  literature taken at third year literature helps students get a very basic understanding of the written language both from a magical and a muggle perspective can be taken at newt level  introduction to healing basic healing subject taken at newt level does exactly what it say s on the tin  magical theory newt level in depth look at magical theory why spells do a certain thing  how language effects spells  how spells are created  aside from these i believe professor binns would have been sacked or at least  a history of magic professor hired to actually do a decent job and teach the students in an engaging way binns will teach to an empty classroom he wo nt mind or notice ,d01sgln,harrypotter,entertainment,1455622799,shaun056,8,0,5149,11702,0.0

i think snape was jealous of james  but not really for the reasons that most people think especially lupin here snape does hate that james is popular   big quidditch hero   but also does nt value athleticism   i d rather be brainy than brawny    he s more madjealous that society values these things over things he values that james and sirius were handed everything in life looks  money  popularity  and his intelligence and hard work despite coming from poverty means nothing ,d014toe,harrypotter,entertainment,1455573228,spirklet,11,0,7466,19463,0.0
i think lupin s right to look for a reasoning beyond lily i thought snape and james had a problem with each other long before lily became an issue jameslily might have made it worse  but it was nt the source of their problem   plus  if lupin had any suspicions about snapelily  i doubt he d voice it in front of harry ,d013il1,harrypotter,entertainment,1455571315,muted90,14,0,1,288,0.0
i m going to make a lot of assumptions here so please bare with me  being in the order would bring about a lot of intimate information lupin was nt a person to blab what he knows and frankly who would he have talked to with sirius in prison  after lily s death snape would ve been inconsolable who knows how he reacted  probably withdrawing  and maybe even slipping up in front of members of the order because only they would be showing any emotion about the potters  remus is kind  compassionate  caring  and introspective perhaps these qualities couple with a few scraps of information from dumbledore or another member of the order and the out of character  overreaction  by snape  which by most people s standard would be controlled  but for a fellow introvert these signs could be a bit more obvious  of course if remus knows or caught wind that snape s patronus changed and bang  we get that odd sentence structure in the quote  retread it this time with the knowledge that remus is keeping the information guarded either for harry or even snap s sake it s an odd place to pause and he mentions  thinking  as in hypothesizing and using  anyway  as a throw away to move the subject along without dwelling i believe he s just giving a plausible story with partial truth but he knows the truth and is just being a good person and sparing two people a lot of pain and confusion ,d0189ed,harrypotter,entertainment,1455578479,AthosN8,2,0,4977,5879,0.0

hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time ,45xmfq,harrypotter,entertainment,1455557881,Fuzzylemons,4,0,449,1024,0.0
this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that ,d00v17i,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559134,mjfc893,10,0,23,55,0.0
all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ,d00vxp9,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560441,palcatraz,4,0,50,34365,0.0
1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had become toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her ,d00vc6k,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559577,trekkie_becky,2,0,5956,33693,1.0

i ve wondered about the portraits too i did nt think about it exactly as rules but  1 are the portraits given a copy of the memories of the person they represent  i would have thought so  but the other post by macabregoblin here and the mentioned wiki seem to say no  2 do the portraits have the personality of the subject  i think the answer to this is yes otherwise the portraits are pointless right  the only connection to the subject would be the way they look  3 are the portraits intelligent  can they solve problems  i think so it seems they should be able to pass a turing test  https  enwikipediaorgwikituring_test  4 are the portraits conscious  are they  living   and would it be a crime similar to murder to destroy one  this is another artificial intelligence type of question  like is it moral to kill commander data from star trek portraits are fun in fanfiction there is a popular postdeathly hallows fan fiction where there was a portrait of fred weasley that george brought to fred s funeral that would be creepy there is another one where harry s grandparents  portraits are in his vaults and he has long conversations with them both are good fics  sorry i ca nt remember what they were called ,d02to0m,harrypotter,entertainment,1455682161,hobbes64,1,0,1,165,0.0

or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement ,45vzuy,harrypotter,entertainment,1455534433,AllyUnion,6,0,4,18,0.0

my thoughts are  that magical destruction is final much like avada kedavera once it s goneit s gone  i m not sure what precedent is set for returning magical artifacts from ashes  other than obviously a phoenix  so it really boils down too is the ror more magical than magical destruction  i believe no  however the ror could conjure a fairly detailed replication of the original item if it was wellneeded the original however would be destroyed ,d00m62f,harrypotter,entertainment,1455543962,AthosN8,3,0,4977,5879,0.0

the room of requirement ca nt summon any objects from the room of hidden things because its purpose of keeping things hiddenwhen hermione tries to summon the diadem in deathly hallows it didnt work now you could say that maybe  as a headcanon  that voldemort put an enchantment on the tiara so it ca nt be summonedbut that ca nt be true because voldemort did nt think that anyone would know about the room so what was the point  i do nt know what happened to the room of requirement after the fiendfyre ate all the objectsnothing in the books says anything about it afterward also the transfiguration part would require you to know what the object was before it burned to ashes so i do nt think they can as for summoning the objects  requesting the ror  back from the asheswe really do nt know the limits of the room s magic also fiendfyre is very dark magic so i do nt think it s likely the room can bring it back ,d00wned,harrypotter,entertainment,1455561468,Mrsphysics,1,0,1,170,0.0

  values values values values values not traits   i do nt understand why people do nt get this the hat sorts you based on what you value  not your traits the world is nt black and white you re not going to get sorted into a house based on a single trait hermione did nt deserve to get put in ravenclaw just because she was smart she valued bravery and loyalty that s why she was in gryffindor  snape had no ambition  what  one of his main goals was being apart of something big  and he was he helped take down one of the biggest dark wizards of all time no ambition  the dude had invented new spells by the time he was 15 he improved on standard potions  created and published by experts  and made them better before he even finished puberty no ambition  what  he   valued   ambition part of the reason he criticized harry so much  along with james  was because he saw no ambition in him he felt like harry got everything handed to him  i m not saying whether i agree or not  just what snape felt   instead of working hard to achieve his goals  unlike snape himself again  he   valued   ambition  pettigrew   valued   bravery that s why he hung out with james  sirius  and lupin he idolized them he wanted to be like them he followed them around everywhere he even became an animagus for them  even though he almost did nt make it but in the end  he did nt have the guts to be brave himself but how the hell was the hat supposed to know that  it ca nt tell the future it did nt know he would betray his best friends  again  the world is nt black and white you re not going to be placed in ravenclaw just because you re  smart   there are plenty of smart people in other houses you re not going to be placed in slytherin just because you re  ambitious   there are plenty of ambitious people in other houses you get placed in a house based on what you value deep inside whether you follow through fulfilling these values yourself is nt for the hat to decide  it s for you the hat is not a fortune teller ,d02a9nl,harrypotter,entertainment,1455653284,oh_orpheus,17,0,71806,37638,0.0

you need to remember that these kids are 11 at the time and measures them at age 11  not what their future selves will be  one badgood experience or interaction in their live could push them any number of different ways  the sorting hat looks for what traits you value  not necessarily what traits you possess  peter pettigrew into gryffindor a prime example  he looked up to and wanted to be brave like james and siruis  the hat made the right call   just because percy is highly ambitious as the time we see him in the books does nt mean that s who he was at 11  he might have looked up to and tried to be like charlie  who was brave  therefore gryffindor was again the right choice ,d01k4c2,harrypotter,entertainment,1455597502,managed_mischief_,20,0,1,1181,0.0

hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time ,45xmfq,harrypotter,entertainment,1455557881,Fuzzylemons,4,0,449,1024,0.0
this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that ,d00v17i,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559134,mjfc893,10,0,23,55,0.0
all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ,d00vxp9,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560441,palcatraz,4,0,50,34365,0.0
1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had become toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her ,d00vc6k,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559577,trekkie_becky,2,0,5956,33693,1.0

gt  yes it would have cost them their afterlives i think this is it accepting the afterlife is  within this world  the more brave and enlightened choice most people choose death it takes an extreme fear to choose to remain on the earth as a ghost  and i think it may be something ghosts regret  gt   wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth  to walk palely where their living selves once trod   said nick miserably  but very few wizards choose that path  gt   you  re dead  aren  t you   said harry exasperatedly  who can answer better than you   gt   i was afraid of death   said nick  i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i oughtn  t to have    well  that is neither here nor there    in fact  i am neither here nor there     he gave a small sad chuckle  i know nothing of the secrets of death  harry  for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead  which then leads us to ask why voldemort did not choose this option  perhaps because his soul was nt whole enough to make that choice  i think  in the end  voldemort s fate is far far worse than that even of a ghost  and though dumbledore says  do not pity the dead   i think he means those that chose a normal afterlife i think in this world  ghosts are to be pitied ,d02u8z5,harrypotter,entertainment,1455683187,bisonburgers,1,0,5,24815,0.0

breaking news  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the senate should not confirm a replacement for supreme court justice antonin scalia until after all of the late justice  s horcruxes have been destroyed   a horcrux is a powerful artifact in which a wizard has hidden a piece of his or her soul in hopes of attaining immortality   stated mcconnell  justice scalia  s body may be dead but  by creating horcruxes  dark lord scalia gained the ability to anchor his soul to the earth   it  s not a surprise   said a senior white house official  we  ve known for some time that scalia was inching closer and closer to true immortality as his body withered away  republicans in congress and in the 2016 presidential field united behind mcconnell  contending that the circumstances of scalia  s death  the first horcrux chase since frank murphy famously thrust a dragon  s tooth through the diary of pierce butler before being confirmed  made it necessary to leave the appointment until every piece of scalia  s tangible soul had been vanquished  senate minority leader harry reid lined up firmly behind president obama  the president can and should send the senate a nominee right away   he said in a statement  it would be unprecedented in recent history for a supreme court seat to remain vacant while a team of courageous wizards hunt down the vestiges of scalia  s dark power  calls to honor the tradition of highcourt nominations in spite of the dark wizard  s shadowy tokens were immediately rejected by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  riowa   who stated plainly that he has no plans to start up the confirmation process on his panel until the last relics had been quelled   this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent the will of dark wizards and push through his own agenda   grassley said  it only makes sense that we wait until the ghostly monuments of his darkness have been dismantled before moving forward  by using his power as chairman to block a vote in committee  grassley can prevent democrats from trying to call up a nomination on the senate floor  at least until every antique carrying the spirit of scalia has been lay waste to  sens rubio of florida and cruz of texas urged mcconnell to block a new confirmation rubio said the nomination could absolutely not occur while the horcruxes remained by threat of armageddon  while cruz bluntly said it is the senate  s duty to slow down a confirmation process until the cold heirlooms of the late justice had been found and eradicated   justice scalia was a dark wizard we owe it to him  amp  the nation  for the senate to ensure that there is no replacement while the power of scalia  s horcruxes remains   cruz said on twitter  wrote this while bored of working hope you enjoyed it  jacob van lunen,45z2p0,harrypotter,entertainment,1455574409,JacobVanLunen,15,0,2,8,0.0

i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know ,45znqo,harrypotter,entertainment,1455581228,magic_rhyme,6,0,123,4165,0.0

my take on why most electronics can not not work in a magical environment is because magic  as a field of energy interferes with the electric field and jams the current or something we see that it takes a great deal of effort to modify electronic equipment before they can work with magic  eg mr weasley s efforts with the car  although how ron could use the fellytone  remains to be explained   so i m guessing that work goes into vanishing all electric related components  such as wires  magnets  circuit boards  and replacing them with some other thing  i would presume magic would be unable to repair electronics  since it stops them from working even when not broken however uelstren suggested  a milimeter mistake means it wo nt work   which suggest it might be a scaling issueperhaps it requires a lot of precision and an ability to move things at a very small scale which most wizards or witches would nt be familiar with in their daytoday use of magic i expect eventually a really bright muggleborn will figure this out and invent a new type of spell that would tap on the electric field itself to achieve the minute changes required to repair electronics  but woah  this is venturing into a whole new area haha edit  added more thoughts,d023nl2,harrypotter,entertainment,1455644361,Rainholly42,2,0,896,2837,0.0

i ve wondered this before  too in hbp  slughorn and dumbledore do some kind of magic to repair all of the items in the muggle house that slughorn destroyed in an attempt to hide not sure how many of the items are slughorn s and how many are the muggles   and maybe none of them are electronic  but they seem to put them all back together again with no problems  maybe it has to do with the relative skill of the witchwizard and their knowledge of the broken items ,d02dqrk,harrypotter,entertainment,1455657885,poufsouffle_pants,2,0,1,27,0.0

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments445834chapter_by_chapter_538_the_second_war_begins    synopsis   we meet the muggle prime minister he s thinking about all the recent tragedies that have happened a person in a painting coughs and announces the arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet    quotable quote   the trouble is  the other side can do magic to  prime minister ,45xv8m,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560764,chimpwizard,7,0,14233,61124,1.0

gt  fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food  how so  there are multiple instances in the series where they transfigure an inanimate object into an animal  such as when cedric transfigures a rock into a dog when fighting his dragon in gof   by your logic that should impossible  as a violation of the gamp law too i think somehow  magic  is able to tell the difference between food and living animals  gt  if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that  yeah  but it would be fairly obvious if the prime minister started trying to remove the wall people in his office would ask him what he was doing  and when he refused answer  they would definitely think he was going crazy even if he called in a professional construction crew to remove wall  they would still expect to be paid the prime minister is going to have a difficult time explaining why he s spending the taxpayers  money on renovating a building that has no structural issues  gt  fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that  i do nt think fudge cared whether or not harry  forgave  him  i think he assumed that he could bribe harry with the promise of political benefits  such as offering him a fasttrack into becoming an auror   but was ultimately disappointed to learn that harry was not for sale  as he was  dumbledore s man through and through ,d010xce,harrypotter,entertainment,1455567597,tinsmith63,3,0,1,1081,0.0

gt  we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them  she did nt seem to be on dumbledore s side  in particular  when we saw her at harry s hearing  but i would imagine that a fair minded woman high up in the ministry would be a bit of a hindrance to voldemort in his rise to power once she saw evidence of his return  surely she would nt support him and anyone that was against him was pretty much dead  gt  the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them  i do nt think its their job to walk around the country willynilly  but i took it to mean that the huge amount of them pretty much invading really made a difference even if they were just secluded to certain pockets  their numbers would probably have a noticeable effect  especially since there normally are nt any dementors outside of azkaban  gt  do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world  i was thinking they would be obliviated once they leave office after all  it s not like everyone in politics knows about wizards  it s just them so at the very end of term  maybe on their last day  or maybe there is something like a passing of the torch where the outgoing prime minister introduces the incoming prime minister to the minister of magic and then right after that meeting   obliviate  ,d01mdos,harrypotter,entertainment,1455602132,apprberriepie,1,0,784,5762,0.0

or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement ,45vzuy,harrypotter,entertainment,1455534433,AllyUnion,6,0,4,18,0.0

my thoughts are  that magical destruction is final much like avada kedavera once it s goneit s gone  i m not sure what precedent is set for returning magical artifacts from ashes  other than obviously a phoenix  so it really boils down too is the ror more magical than magical destruction  i believe no  however the ror could conjure a fairly detailed replication of the original item if it was wellneeded the original however would be destroyed ,d00m62f,harrypotter,entertainment,1455543962,AthosN8,3,0,4977,5879,0.0

the room of requirement ca nt summon any objects from the room of hidden things because its purpose of keeping things hiddenwhen hermione tries to summon the diadem in deathly hallows it didnt work now you could say that maybe  as a headcanon  that voldemort put an enchantment on the tiara so it ca nt be summonedbut that ca nt be true because voldemort did nt think that anyone would know about the room so what was the point  i do nt know what happened to the room of requirement after the fiendfyre ate all the objectsnothing in the books says anything about it afterward also the transfiguration part would require you to know what the object was before it burned to ashes so i do nt think they can as for summoning the objects  requesting the ror  back from the asheswe really do nt know the limits of the room s magic also fiendfyre is very dark magic so i do nt think it s likely the room can bring it back ,d00wned,harrypotter,entertainment,1455561468,Mrsphysics,1,0,1,170,0.0

this is my first post  ca nt wait to be apart of the wonderful world you guys have made here  i first read the series probably five or more years ago  but i ve been rereading them over the past six months or so  and i m always impressed by jk s literary prowess  i just finished  goblet of fire   and i wanted to share an example with you guys of foreshadowing  three whole books in advance   that i only realized my third pass through the book this is the scene towards the end of the book in which dumbledore is questioning harry about what happened in the graveyard it s the part where harry tells dumbledore and sirius about wormtail taking his blood  695696   gt  when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger  however  sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them  gt   he said my blood would make him stronger than if he d used someone else s   harry told dumbledore  he said the protection my  my mother left in me  he d have it too and he was right  he could touch me without hurting himself  he touched my face  gt  for a fleeting instant  harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledore s eyes but next second  harry was sure he had imagined it  for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk  he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him  i m fairly sure that  triumph  is foreshadowing for the end of  deathly hallows  where dumbledore explains to harry that  by taking harry s blood  voldemort keeps harry alive even in his death it s only one sentence  and it s buried pretty deeply in the fourth book  but it shows not only jk s concrete knowledge of the future of the plot  but also dumbledore s knowledge of harry s future and the hope that voldemort s arrogance has created  the books are riddled  ha  with all sorts of examples like this  and they really do show how well jk had the story laid out years ahead of time as a fan rereading the series  these are the little details that make you glad you chose to read again  edit  formatting,45wynw,harrypotter,entertainment,1455550202,ThisCrookedVulture,70,0,82,160,0.0
there are quite a few moments like this  voldemort tells his death eaters that he has traveled further along the path to immortality than any other wizard  which is a clear hint at his experimentation with horcruxes ,d00rc3y,harrypotter,entertainment,1455553631,AA25Mamba,25,0,423,1103,0.0
absolutely  i m sure that dumbledore could not think of any way to get harry through this alive when he heard what voldemort had done  it must have been a great wave of relief ,d00rjmv,harrypotter,entertainment,1455553958,StoveGil,13,0,6,458,0.0
it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister ,d011ure,harrypotter,entertainment,1455568927,mikkeldaman,8,0,4,20037,0.0

yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  welcome to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place ,d00ruud,harrypotter,entertainment,1455554443,poufsouffle_pants,11,0,1,27,0.0
yep the first one i saw on my first run on the books is when trelawney has her real prediction in front of harry when harry reports it to dumbledore  he says something like   that s her second real prophecy  harry did not inquire what was the first one  which was revealed only on the 5th book ,d01bjxs,harrypotter,entertainment,1455583778,KitKal,3,0,3271,352,0.0
i was literally reading this part last night and thought the exact same thing great find   the best thing about rereading the series is that you pick up small details like this each time i ve just finished gof for the fourth time now and i ve found some new small detail like this every time  you have to admire jk s thought process when writing these books  she clearly had the whole thing planned out very well these small hints are evidence of that ,d01sihr,harrypotter,entertainment,1455622994,SkoliarRS,3,0,1176,892,0.0

this one is nt nearly as monumental as the foreshadowing you mentioned but one of the instances of foreshadowing i always though was cool was madam rosmerta in hbp right before the part where katie bell is almost killed by the necklace harry  ron  and hermione are in the 3 broomsticks and ron is looking around trying to catch a glimpse of madam rosmerta hermione asks ron what he s looking for and ron says  nothing   hermione responds with something to the effect of  i expect nothing s in the back getting more firewhiskey   in reality though she was already under malfoy s imperius curse in the woman s restroom waiting for a hogwarts student to give the necklace too ,d02267d,harrypotter,entertainment,1455642302,elangomatt,2,0,65,2940,1.0

 link to previous chapter   http  wwwredditcomrharrypottercomments45xv8mchapter_by_chapter_61_the_other_minister    synopsis   bellatrix and narcissa arrive at snape s house narcissa wants to talk to him bella is trying to stop her she thinks snape is a traitor they arrive at his door and snape welcomes them in snape bullies wormtail a bit then bellatrix questions snape about whose side he is on he is able to explain away all her questions then narcissa has a chance to air her worry draco has been given a task by the dark lord narcissa thinks he ll die in the attempt she asks snape to do it instead of draco she makes him swear the unbreakable vow to protect draco and carry out the deed should he fail    poi    bellatrix kills a fox here but she does nt say avada kedavra which suggests that it can be used non verbally given the number of times other people use it and say the incantation  you kinda get the impression that it can only be used verbally but this would suggest otherwise   bellatrix says that snape lives in a  muggle dunghill   but considering that hogsmeade is the only fully wizard village in britain  would nt most wizards live in towns predominantly muggle  unless you live in the middle of nowhere   this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place   spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth and it s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps  we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up  voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius he misjudges the malfoy family they seem to have very little loyalty to him they see him as a sure bet their work for him is all in their own self interest but the minute when it is nt in their self interest to support him  they disobey narcissa here was nt supposed to talk about draco s mission to snape but she does it to protect her son and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this it s a very slytherin trait to protect yourself first   does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore s side  or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord   snape is able to hide his emotions so well but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily  would he be able to conceal his emotions about that  would he betray himself   are snape s parents alive  what happened to them   do you think snape s attitude toward muggles has matured  because i m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father but that seems like something you can mature out of as an adult  you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to has snape rationalised that within himself  or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily  he did nt seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them does he understand that now as an adult   where does the hidden staircase in snape s house lead to  was that an original part of the house   snape being able to boss around wormtail must ve been so fantastic for snape yeah he s not james or sirius but he s one of the next best options and also partially responsible for the death of lily he has to love bullying him   would nt wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form   it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix   do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus   i know most people seem to love alan rickman s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman s snape does nt say much he picks and chooses his words very carefully but the book snape is much more verbose   snape catches bella out here she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort it s a loselose for her   snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore was that voldemort s idea  or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet  because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts   does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job  i presume it s because it s because of the curse on the job more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse   snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore what information did he give  and how does he hide the vital stuff  does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not   if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps  what changes  how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so   snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever   voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour which seems to have both positive and negative consequences i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters   bella says  the dark lord has  in the past  entrusted me with his most precious  and cuts herself off is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault   jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away   snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance so did dumbledore sacrifice her  did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death  why did he pick her  is snape here lying to bella  maybe he s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him   snape is in his element here when he s insulting harry and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him he s so sincere with his dislike of harry he s not putting on any pretence at all   snape talks about dumbledore s greatest weakness that he has to see the best in people now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him now to me  this is a good lie because it s got a fair bit of truth in it but it s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another   how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore  did it affect him at all  or was snape lying here   what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore s injury  how does he tell him how it was sustained   is narcissa a death eater  she was nt at the graveyard when voldemort returned so is she kind ve an associate  an honorary death eater   why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore  would nt it make perfect sense  otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps  does snape actually know the plan here  or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it  he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious    if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others   draco kinda achieved his goal he only really failed at the final hurdle but the end result was the same anyway so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it  lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book so it would seem not   narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite is she just sucking up to him  or does voldemort favour snape most  and why is snape voldemort s favourite  does voldemort see himself in snape   dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer   snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer but when dumbledore actually dies  there s pretty much no need for a spy the order crumbles without dumbledore they have no leadership and they have no initiative it s almost not worth spying on anymore   bella talks about if she had sons do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her  we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord would bella follow the same route  or would she be utterly psychotic   we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow i m kinda surprised that voldemort would nt make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him maybe he thinks it s unnecessary   what happens with an unbreakable vow if there s some grey area involved  not all cases are black and white   in court  they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings yeah it would be a little barbaric but you d get the truth out of people   i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done   the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow  some speculated that snape was on neither side he was just out for himself it was a huge gamble though from snape he called bella s bluff which had to earn him points    quotable quote   well wormtail s

gt  dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer  i think she was a lot more worried about what voldemort would do if he was unsuccessful  not how dumbledore would retaliate also  perhaps just looking out for his innocence seeing him as her little boy and not wanting to have death on his hands so early on in life ,d02h5o8,harrypotter,entertainment,1455662561,genaricfrancais,1,0,60,1027,0.0
gt  this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place  i think there s a part of snape s psyche that feels he  deserves  to be in despair  as a sort of punishment for allowing lily to come to harm  and also for throwing his lot in with the death eaters in the first place this would explain why he walks around with such a miserable attitude  always wearing a sneer on his face and constantly belittling his students in a pathetic attempt to elevate himself a part of him really believes that he is  supposed  to be miserable  and that s why he brings himself back to his childhood home  the place where he felt nothing but misery growing up ,d02r6ar,harrypotter,entertainment,1455677993,tinsmith63,1,0,1,1081,0.0
gt  jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away  i think snape probably revealed it  but he would have convinced them that no one would use the hq for anything now that dumbledore died and he revealed his  true  allegiance surely they would nt think there s anything worth looking for in the hq since snape has been feeding them information all along anyway not sure if it would be necessary or worth for them to check it out even if he revealed the location it was probably more worth it to target places that actually have order members they want to go after  like the burrow  ,d02vohd,harrypotter,entertainment,1455685867,apprberriepie,1,0,784,5762,0.0
i read the books between 8 and 14 as they came out  so i did nt retain a whole lot the first time through  she gives harry a lot more detention and shows absolutely no remorse for actually physically abusing him in fact  she often says he needs more i also just finished the chapter where she bans him  fred  and george from the quidditch team i completely forgot about that and man does it piss me off especially when she says she decided to go to fudge when mcgonagalldumbledore allowed the gryffindor team to reform and when she says she wants their brooms confiscated and put in her office  i knew i hated her  but now i m relearning why ,460dix,harrypotter,entertainment,1455590957,Elemental_Dragon,17,0,11217,21202,0.0

i feel there was nt enough in the movies actually it seems worse in the movies because all the pranks and fighting back against her  catharsis  fireworks  weasleys  is nt in the movie until just before they go to the ministry and the decrees were in higher number so i imagine in the film s universe it felt a lot worse whereas in the books it would ve been better ,d0249ec,harrypotter,entertainment,1455645189,Alagorn,1,0,21,6689,1.0
