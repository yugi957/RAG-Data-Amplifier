that tom cruise s character  john anderton  kidnaps the precog agatha in a pool  mirroring his own son s kidnapping  which was also by a pool  there is also the irony in that he joined precrime to stop incidences like his son s kidnapping yet he resorts to kidnapping afterwards in order to prove that the system he worked so hard to develop was wrong  great movie ,465qz3,movies,entertainment,1455672253.0,tangowhiskey33,16.0,0.0,7346,6138,0.0
dear god that was one of the most incredible movies i ve ever seen  going into it i knew only a few things that it takes place in world where women have become infertile and one woman has become pregnant  clive owen must guide her to safety there s a long take in a car and julianne moore gets shot yeah  it sucks that that part got spoiled for me but i was in shock it happened so early on in the movie but i had no idea that this film would be so incredible  every performance was incredible  not a single weak one the cinematography is some of the greatest i have seen and was honestly better than lubezki s in the revenant every single shot was filmed so incredibly and had me sucked in and dear god that long take when theo is navigating the city at the end was one of the best tracking shots i ve ever seen overall any small flaws i may have with this movie in subsequent watches will be overshadowed by everything else being perfect one of the best movie s i ve ever seen  1010  just one question though  what really was the fishes true motives  did they want the baby to survive or not  and what did they want to do with it  i m a little confused there ,466ix2,movies,entertainment,1455682980.0,MojaveWalker,10.0,0.0,6942,3348,0.0

agreed wholeheartedly this movie is why  frankly  i was kind of disappointed with gravity  which was also directed by alfonso cuaron   technically gravity is breathtaking but is still this spacestation hopping modern tale of survival children of the men  on the other hand  is a fictitious world working on this fantastic premise that still works why  it s because it seems to effortlessly saturate us with little things to suggest that this world exists the religious protesters  the ringing in his ears  the family portraits around the room  to answer your question about the fishes i think it was best left ambiguous to pin it to a simple answer  i think they wanted the baby to live and for them to prey upon the blind desperation of the world on the other side of the coin cinematically  think about the little girl in waterworld she is presented as symbol to acquire control in a postapocalyptic world ,d02v8b2,movies,entertainment,1455684997.0,Bunyip_Jack,1.0,0.0,11,5844,0.0

 drive in movie critic  joe bob briggs had a formula for how to make a successful sequel   the first rule of all drivein sequels  make the same damn movie you made the first time   and while he meant it in jest  there is a strong statement in there about making  any  movie sequel  so make a list about what was truly great about the original blade runner so many things  the great model of los angeles  worth a travelogue as a city of the future  the culture of the place with giant pyramids and smokestacks belching pollution and airships and flying cars  totally original music  not just space travel  but space war  capitalist androids and megacorporations  etc  etc  there is also the downside of filth and decay  great and small details like the dust on top of bryant s ceiling and a run down version of the idiosyncratic bradford building  the end result is a truly breathtaking and majestic movie a complete world what parts of that can both be reproduced in a sequel yet be made novel enough to grasp the imagination  for a plot  you need villains in this case  the more  the merrier nexus7s and perhaps nexus8s  running amok ,d02qkzg,movies,entertainment,1455677056.0,WendyLRogers3,1.0,0.0,428,85673,0.0

what if we just get ride of the current rating system  i propose a score based on 4 points language  sexual content  violence  and substance abuse will be each scored from 1100  then an average would be found that movie would then have a maturity content score similar to how rotten tomatoes score their films  this way  we can include more gray area score  instead of the 4 basic groups studios can also mess with the formula to try and get a lower score  cut more language and add more violence  ,d02g5hy,movies,entertainment,1455661131.0,nowhereman136,4.0,0.0,1,6380,0.0

i thought the article hit on a lot of interesting points  but did nt put enough focus on a major difference between the original novel and the two films based on it that would make any adaptation of the source material a challenge beyond the difficult subject matter that make any attempt to adapt the novel hard  an issue which the article explores with aplomb   a big part of what made lolita a superior novel is nabakov s incredible writing  and that s almost inevitably lost in a visual medium  sure  there s a lot of worthwhile thematic material to be gleaned from the plot alone  but so much of what makes the plot tolerable is that nabakov puts you inside the head of a monster  that it s an examination of what makes someone like humbert tick and the twisted filter through which he sees the world even if a movie adaptation could survive the loss of nabakov s prose  it s always going to be on the outside looking in when it comes to humbert and his deviance  and that removes the ambiguity and distance between how humbert sees himself and the actual horror of what he does  which  to my mind  is the sharpest and most incisive part of the source material ,d02qx6y,movies,entertainment,1455677585.0,Limin8tor,1.0,0.0,6946,6327,0.0

you ca nt really get angry at critics as a whole  because lists like this do nt take into account how much some critics hated the film  only how much others loved it so keep the anger inside  and let

richard ayoade s  the double  comes to mind not necessarily a mindfuck kind of movie  just interestingly directed and and the plot is creative  it s about a shy man named simon james  played by jesse eisenberg in one of his best roles  imo  who works in an office and he s in love with the girl who works a few floors up  who also happens to live in the apartment across from his a man who looks exactly like him named james simon  also played by eisenberg  comes to work at his office and people instantly like his double better  because he s confident and smooth  but no one seems to notice that they look exactly alike  a couple other interesting ones that kind of fall into the same category are stranger than fiction and ruby sparks stranger than fiction is about a man who realizes that he has been the main character in someone else s novel his entire life  and sets out to find his author ruby sparks is about a novelist who writes himself  the perfect girlfriend  and she comes to life  and he has to deal with the repercussions of it ,d02ulm5,movies,entertainment,1455683818.0,games_and_movies,1.0,0.0,1,579,0.0

how rooney mara was nt nominated alongside cate blanchett in the best actress category when she had six more minutes of screen time is beyond me really  academy  does jennifer lawrence need another oscar nomination  but i digress  this movie was stunning  both visually and emotionally  as  ultimately  it s a love story a doomed one  but a love story nonetheless the two protagonists  carol and therese  are so likable when they re separate  but they have palpable chemistry when they re together  which is what a lot of romance movies forget to do nowadays  the two lovers need to be sympathetic on their own if we ever expect to like them when they re together but  through scenes of carol interacting with her young daughter  and therese s interactions with her coworkers and friends  we see that these are interesting characters that an audience can get behind and more importantly  we see that they are both stuck in a situation that they do nt want to be in  a large portion of why this movie is so good has to do with its actors as i mentioned earlier  blanchett and mara are basically pitch perfect as the two lovers in this film they  along with director todd haynes  really know how to capture both the romance and the tragedy that comes along with being lesbians in that moment in history every time they share a scene together  their chemistry is damn near tangible you can tell that they felt very comfortable around one another and supporting roles from kyle chandler and sarah paulson certainly helped propel the characters  relationships forward even further  a lot of people were upset that this was nt nominated for best picture and best director and yeah  i get it now this is a near perfect romance movie  gay or straight  and everyone should see it as soon as possible ,466ddb,movies,entertainment,1455680743.0,FredVogel,6.0,0.0,1,31,0.0

the similar roles of tom hardy and eric bana some of the similarities are the sort of things you d find on a lot of actors cvs  they were both in black hawk down  they both played heroes of greek myth  members of the british nobility  70s intelligence operatives etc even the fact they ve both played incredibly musclebound comic book characters is nt too much of a stretch with all the superhero movies around now  but a couple of the coincidences are definitely oddly specific  for example they ve both played bald star trek villains from the romulan empire who plotted to destroy earth with super weapons  shinzon and nero  and they ve both played notorious prison hard men with distinctive facial hair in biopics named for the characters alias  bronson and chopper   one final coincidence is that bana was inspired to get into acting after watching mad max  his first car was the same model as max s pursuit special and he even made a documentary about his love for it but of course when they came to recast max  rather than the australian bana  they went with hardy ,d02p7gx,movies,entertainment,1455674920.0,disposableday,6.0,0.0,4,11361,0.0

i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i do nt know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got  i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that do nt know  it s based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt  who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver  whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type  who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed  lauda was played by daniel bruhl  you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds  and i truly think  without hyperbole  that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career is nt as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy  and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey s performance in dallas buyers club matt did well do nt get me wrong  but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming  just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan  and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy  but honestly   the whole cast was perfect   http  wtf1coukwpcontentuploads2013098m7vtxe1024x778jpg   it s actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park  it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact  one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he s banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them  peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think it s interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other  i think that s one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life does nt normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made  rush  feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times  whether or not they re on the track  but as far as the directing  howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track  there s a very raw scene in a hospital which i wo nt spoil  but it s hard to watch   but i think the best part of the whole movie  and what made it one of the best experiences i ve ever had in a theater  was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable  and makes you feel like you re watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters  i felt like i was actually on the race track i m so  so glad i was one of the  apparently few  people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters ca nt match  but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to marty s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader  i really ca nt recommend  rush  more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie ,45yhrm,movies,entertainment,1455567700.0,MasterLawlz,506.0,0.0,117403,118750,0.0

the movie is great and bruhl nailed lauda s personality  in my opinion one reason i love the movie is that for the most part it did open wheel racing justice  something some trash like driven definitely did nt however  i think because it was about open wheel racing a lot of americans snubbed it unfortunately  ricky bobby and talladega nights is what american audiences will watch in terms of auto racing that  or fast amp  furious 14 ,d0120wq,movies,entertainment,1455569165.0,ChewieWookie,10.0,0.0,1,14938,0.0

definitely the sound was the aspect of this film that stood out most for me  it really used the 1 in 51 to fantastic effect all the gear shifts and engine noise were subtlety underscored by the sub rather than constant sub boosting it was actually thoughtfully added occasionally for punctuation  a think aside from the sound editing and mix the cinematography was the star of that film it had such a vibrant and evocative use of colour and light ,d019n85,movies,entertainment,1455580687.0,teaqualizer,3.0,0.0,1132,17524,0.0

so hear me out here  everyone assumes that days of future past retconned wade wilson from xmen origins and turned him into the wade wilson from deadpool the problem with this is that the past portions of dofp take place in 1973  while the scene with team x in xmen origins takes place in 1979 the wade wilson from xmen origins would have already been born sometime in the 1950 s  maybe even late 40 s   while the wade wilson from deadpool was nt born until sometime in the 80 s  or late 70 s   my headcanon is that the original wade wilson probably abandoned deadpool  gave him up for adoption  or simply passed away while acting as a mercenary i understand that many will think that i m taking details from  deadpool  too seriously  but i think it s fun to think about it  especially when  i love having an overview over the xmen cinematic universe   https  wwwredditcomrmoviescomments26vlqlxmen_visual_timeline_oc   tl  dr  wade wilson from deadpool is possibly the son of an alternate version of the wade wilson from xmen origins  wolverine ,4660c5,movies,entertainment,1455675804.0,mmmasian,2.0,0.0,10311,8130,0.0

i m going to go against popular opinion here  everyone here is shitting on  hollywood  but hollywood is a massive industry with several different production companies each overseeing many  many projects that involve many  many different people some of these studios  projects  people  etc pull off amazing successes  and some of them end up as complete duds for the most part  movie ticket sales have been increasing year after year  at a rate higher than inflation  so i would say hollywood is doing a pretty good job so when it comes to deadpool  if hollywood pumps out a bunch of r rated action comedies and runs that into the ground  but they make a shitton of money doing so  they did nt learn the wrong lessons  maybe if the general public actually supported new and creative projects  hollywood would take more risks when the top grossing movies of the past decade have overwhelmingly been remakes or sequels  that says more about the audience than the producer ,d013iir,movies,entertainment,1455571311.0,SS324,213.0,0.0,1,5163,1.0

he s not wrong  the problem is that what made  deadpool  a good movie is nt always easily replicated  and hollywood is first and foremost a business that wants to replicate success oftentimes  what makes a thing successful depends heavily on the zeitgeist  think of how many movies we call  underappreciated gems  while we marvel that sony greenlit  pixels   obviously  someone  somewhere  thought that  pixels  was going to generate money and why not  it has a bigbudget star  adam sandler   a topic we all find endearing  classic video games   upandcoming stars  josh gad  and an immensely popular actor  peter dinklage   happy madison has also produced some startlingly popular  bad  movies  happy gilmore and billy madison are charming pieces of shit  to put it bluntly  but we love them because on some level they re aware of their shittiness   why  should nt  that be successful  on paper  when making a marketing pitch  that all sounds good throw a few million at it  let sandler phone in a goofball performance  and step back to count money as hookers bring you all the cocaine  right  wrong  because the hollywood financial analysis is not built to consider that merely capturing buzzwords and things that are popular fails to account for the specific historicocultural context that made them popular in the first place in less academic terms  it ignores the  heart  of why we like certain things in favor of the flash and style of the things we like ,d0198fz,movies,entertainment,1455580033.0,ccmulligan,9.0,0.0,781,86163,0.0

i was really turned off by the way the film is basically a  cowboys vs indians  movie  and then bends over backwards to pretend it s not the dialogue that exists solely to try to distance the villains from native americans  despite the fact that the film uses native american stereotypes from the old west to create fear  was pretty ridiculous  enjoyed a lot of aspects of the movie  but that just left a really bad taste in my mouth if you realize a premise  the heroic white man vs native american brutes  is terribly outdated  then just do nt use it or use it  but own it using the premise and pretending that you re not is just weak ,d02p03e,movies,entertainment,1455674610.0,Aequitassb,3.0,0.0,262,3627,0.0

the similar roles of tom hardy and eric bana some of the similarities are the sort of things you d find on a lot of actors cvs  they were both in black hawk down  they both played heroes of greek myth  members of the british nobility  70s intelligence operatives etc even the fact they ve both played incredibly musclebound comic book characters is nt too much of a stretch with all the superhero movies around now  but a couple of the coincidences are definitely oddly specific  for example they ve both played bald star trek villains from the romulan empire who plotted to destroy earth with super weapons  shinzon and nero  and they ve both played notorious prison hard men with distinctive facial hair in biopics named for the characters alias  bronson and chopper   one final coincidence is that bana was inspired to get into acting after watching mad max  his first car was the same model as max s pursuit special and he even made a documentary about his love for it but of course when they came to recast max  rather than the australian bana  they went with hardy ,d02p7gx,movies,entertainment,1455674920.0,disposableday,6.0,0.0,4,11361,0.0

fuck i have to say  the trailer does nt make the film look good the accents are ropey  the shots are uninteresting and clich   the dialogue sounds rote and formulaic  the pickpocket gimmick seems oversold and unnecessary  the setpieces all look like they ve been cobbled together from other films  the music was dull  and i feel like i ve seen 80  of the film  and i still have no idea what the actual plot is it feels like a fake trailer from a tv show or something goddamit  why can no one use idris elba right ,d01wqgv,movies,entertainment,1455633836.0,Mr_Evil_MSc,23.0,0.0,4308,165130,0.0

the magic box  robert donat as william friesegreene discovering that his version of a camera works the film is quite romanticised  but seeing him actually run out into the street and show a policeman that his camera works is a joy and the policeman is just dumbfounded  and so was i  because i was struck on two levels  1  it illustrated to me the power of moving images from their inception  that even black and white  mute  scratchy film stock was seen as life when it was projected back then  and 2  it illustrated to me the longevity and rapid evolution of an artform that really has only existed for 120 years or so i was seeing the creation of film  set in the 1890s  made in the 1950s and shown to me in the late 2000s it was one of the few moments that made me realise the joy and wonder of cinema is the same now as it was back then  extra  the end of 12 years a slave was bloody powerful you lose all idea of how long solomon s been captured for and in one shot it just smacks you in the face ,d01un22,movies,entertainment,1455629391.0,Story24,2.0,0.0,4337,304,0.0

film that got stuck in my head for a while  which was completely unexpected  was sicario it captured the morbid reality of cartels really well  the movie reminded me of a disturbing article that was on reddit a while back was something along the lines of  kid thrown off a bridge by gang members because the kid refused to do what the gang told him to do  kill the driver of the next bus that comes along    all because his father was a bus driver ,d02btlr,movies,entertainment,1455655318.0,Radians,3.0,0.0,1,1363,0.0
