i m an older dude and a huge genesis fan so i ll give it a shot this is why i do nt like phil collins  phil was the drummer in one of the seventies greatest prog rock bands around respect for that peter gabriel left and phil replaced him on lead vocals after a massive search for a new lead singer that turned up nobody that interested the band  the great music continued with phil on lead vocals in the late seventiesearly eighties really brilliant stuff gabriel was not missed a few albums into the phil led genesis they had a hit song  follow you  follow me   this was the beginning of the end  but not quite yet  then duke great album  but much more commercial that s cool still a great album and the band is growing  abacab fucking hell  this album is fucking amazing the greatest album genesis has ever released imo commercial  a bit  yes does nt matter brilliant stuff  here s where things start going wrong self titled genesis is next mama dark  beautiful and haunting a huge hit home by the sea the hit that was nt for some reason illegal alien pop garbage and utter shit but mtv blew it up the brilliance that was genesis was about to become a pop band money  girls  fame  whatever it was enticing for the band  they would not release another  good  song after genesis side one with home by the sea the rest was commercial bullshit this is exactly where i personally gave up on them as a band and stopped listening and buying their albums  phil goes solo the allure of fame is too much for him it s all radio friendly pap feel it in the air is undoubtedly a great song  but it was supposed to be a genesis song  and should have been phil collins blows up as a radio friendly pop superstar his musical integrity is fucking gone it s one shitty pop song after another absolutely nothing of substance  then he s doing disney soundtracks let me say that again he s doing disney fucking soundtracks  the drummer  later lead singer of one of the greatest progressive british bands of all time has sold his soul and musical integrity to disney for a paycheck  that s actually the last thing i ve heard  or cared  that phil collins has done he s musically irredeemable in my eyes he is the epitome of a sell out i have lost a lot of respect for him over the years ,d02tvkl,music,entertainment,1455682527.0,thewhitedeath,2.0,0.0,42042,169593,1.0

i m happy for a swedish band  but at the same time personally feel as though lamb of god deserved it more  their newest album really pushed their sound into a new and surprisingly good direction  plus after all randy blythe has been through over the past several years  i think its somewhat of a miracle that they were even able to put together a new album  never mind one that s so interesting and fresh sounding for them  it might also just be me  but i am already tired of ghost s schtick they have going on with all their imagery they re trying to convey i ve already seen it thanks to king diamond  these guys just seem like posers to me  and i am over it shower me with downvotes now  but i m just stating my opinion ,d02copz,music,entertainment,1455656466.0,The_UnApologist,1.0,0.0,647,9751,0.0

i m sure i ll get downvoted for this  but as a longtime metal fan since i was like 12  i am really struggling to see how cirice  or even ghost in general  is  metal   this sounds like heavyriff downtuned melodic  rock   what  cause they re playing palmmuted c  tuned guitars they re  metal   where s the doublebass  where s the technical riffs  where s anything north of 80bpm  light  airilyharmonized vocals and  piano breaks  and this is  metal   power chords in 134 downbeats does not metal make  to be fair  thus far all i ve heard of ghost is meliora but that was 30 minutes at my friend s house when he tried introducing them to me where i was barely tolerating it and certainly will not buy it  or anything from it how this beat  lamb of god s 512   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  dulxbkkj9wg  or slipknot in the  metal category   and while neither of which are even in my top 20 favorites bands either  eg  1 is testament   2 is trivium   3 megadeth  but are both at least certainly more  metal   is beyond me i m not asking for meshuggah or arch enemy out of a swedish melodic metal band for a metal category win  but at least maybe  unsun   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  2o2aec2o4w  or something with a little more energy  cirice about put me to sleep  but  oh wait  this is  the grammys  we re talking about  judging metal right  carry on good for them i guess ,d02jw8t,music,entertainment,1455666792.0,Silidistani,0.0,0.0,285,25491,0.0

i m still not sure how i feel about the album i ve listened to every other one of his albums over the last two months and do nt think it really measures up as a full album or track to track a lot of it is really good but there is nt a great flow through the album with a lot of questionable choices  starting with ultralightbeam i m not into it  chance has a great verse but the track is so repetitive and slow to start that i did nt even notice how good the verse was till taking it out of context of the song  part 1 is a great piece of music around some really bad kanye verses  pt 2 ye is a little better but its mostly just listening to panda by designer with a few twists  famous again has a terrible start to his verse that just tanks an otherwise pretty great song think with this and part 1 he is trying to do way too much contrast  it worked in hold my liquor but not here  feedback is nt any good  amazed it made it on the album have nt got anything from it that makes it stand out from other crap  low lights is nt really a song either  no ye at least  highlights starts to sound like graduation and very celebratory but again i notice the complaint that kanye is not a good lyricist at all and for the first time in 7 albums i m agreeing for the first time  freestyle 4 again is nt really good  nothing kanye on it  sounds really generic 2015 rap song  i love kanye is a self aware meme  i m not sure how it fits  waves for the 3rd time is a great song that ye does nothing good with in his verses  fml and real friends are fantastic  the best of kanye comes through here it sounds like the flows and well thought lyrics of college dropout through mdbtf  wolves i would say is the same  but the older version is probably better  30 hours starts strong and is a good song but it drags on at the end like an outdo  but three songs are left  no more parties in la is a pretty great song because for one kendrick is on it and kanye has more good lines in one verse here than the first 10 songs of the album  facts is a decent song but again seems at odd with kanye being at the front leading but is generic  a bit boring and disappointing even if not bad  fade is really nice beat and definitely is something i can jam to  kind of shit that sounds a bit odd the first time but is a great sound  i have nt seen anything too bad about tidal except lots of stuff out in spotify being hidden in menus wo nt be using it at all after if gets a full release though ,d02rgst,music,entertainment,1455678461.0,bruvar,3.0,0.0,4,7285,0.0

his music is definitely not for me either  ive tried to listen many times and literally just listened through to pimp a butterfly today not a single track really blew me away in any way i really dont get it  but thats fair  i dont decide what other people like and vice versa,d02ch2k,music,entertainment,1455656180.0,Flinkergut,2.0,0.0,942,25566,0.0
i consider myself a big hip hop fan as well and i ve never fully jumped on the kendrick hype train but he is the best thing in mainstream in years like he is a proper artist  it also makes me happy when i hear run the jewels beats on commercials because to me they are the best thing in hip hop at the moment ,d02hub5,music,entertainment,1455663551.0,JacobCrim88,2.0,0.0,3352,16677,1.0
huge fan of hip hop for past 25 years  i just do nt like kendrick lamar no matter how much someone tries to tell me bla bla  i m sorry  i do nt like his shit i change his music every time it comes up now  i respect his poetry and skills  but shit i do nt like any of his music maybe some of his freestyles ,d0257la,music,entertainment,1455646482.0,Pufftreees,5.0,0.0,102,2480,0.0

honestly he s mentioned this before  he is started to push away from mainstream rap into poetry it s very complex and difficult to grasp  and has a completely different purpose than the rap we re used to hearing  it took me a minute because it made me uncomfortable but in hindsight that s one of the powers of art ,d02cq3v,music,entertainment,1455656517.0,coco_moonbabe,0.0,0.0,2,326,0.0
i think it s the scope of his vision  the intellectual rigor of his rhymes  and the sonic ambition behind his releases tpab is an eightyminute hiphop concept album about depression and black identity in an age of black lives matters that combines spokenword poetry  hardbop and modal jazz influences  live instrumentation  and startling  introspective lyrics delivered with passion and technical precision it is daring  challenging music  dense with sonic and lyrical analogy  metaphor and allusion and it is a call for hiphop to rise to the sociopolitical and personal concerns of the present age it s attempting to innovate within its genre in the way that great ambitious  politically black albums in the past have  albums like the payback  whats goin on  there s a riot goin on  bitches brew  sign o the times  it takes a nation of millions to hold us back  yeezus  as for kendrick himself  there s something galvanizing about an unglamorous  seriousminded mc who delivers such consistent intensity and is willing to push the envelopesonically innovate in an age of  hotline bling   when people mistake future rapping  these fuckin  police ca nt touch me  these bogus police ca nt touch me  for woke  topical political content  kendrick seems really refreshing ,d01vle4,music,entertainment,1455631562.0,nottrapt,152.0,0.0,1,844,0.0
solid question  and i think it goes without saying that this is subjective but i believe  kendrick is capturing a higher level of musicproduction  lyricism  both in meaning and in artistry of the lyrics via literary devices   flow  and appeal in  to pimp a butterfly  he demonstrates his deeprooted culture using facets like jazz  ramp  b  soul  funk  and of course  hiphop and rap i sincerely believe this album will go down as one of the best albums of all time  and i hope so not just in rap  but in all music the fact that he followed up an alreadyincredible album of  good kid  maad city  with an album that is only preceded in its number of nominations by michael jackson s  thriller  should speak for itself  but there s more to it the man s a genius and is backed by producers and other musicians who help that shine ,d0213do,music,entertainment,1455640774.0,WARHARSE,5.0,0.0,2,56,0.0
with the past two grammy s he s been targeting situation that are going on in our society he has a bigger perspective of everything and he s targeting groups trying to give them more knowledge he brings a different grove a different swag then others his music is different then others honestly but if you can relate then you might like it he s just not targeting a situation your interested in ,d02sxoh,music,entertainment,1455680891.0,darius4902,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
personally  i m a huge fan of progressive rock  blues  and jazz i find that kendrick is able to blend the lyricism  conceptualism  and experimental aspects associated with prog rock with the musicianship of blues and jazz the fact that he does this within the realm of hiphop is interesting to me because its definitely not something that you hear everyday ,d02iyvv,music,entertainment,1455665273.0,yougotowned,3.0,0.0,562,426,0.0

alright i ve ciphered through some of the comments on here on people justifying how this is a good album  and i have nt come across one valid point of why this is a good album his best three album were his first three banger albums  and quite frankly that was kanye at his prime  when he added flair to the rap game  but still keeping it grounded where is lyricism was on par with most other artists at the time  and where his beats sounded like true rap beats if you do nt believe me  i recommend you to listen to a track from lop and a track from late registration  and you will almost immediately notice the difference in quality  performance  depth and lyrical flowcontext  kanye either chooses to rap or be meta  and quite frankly his meta phase is coming off as insane vs conceptual i do nt see any depth in his music anymore  i see no reference without hypocrisies  and parallel to both yoko and trump in that sense  kanye has officially left the rap game   ,d02m73x,music,entertainment,1455670327.0,kpatsart,6.0,0.0,96,132,0.0

i m really enjoying tlop i love how it jumps schizophrenically between somber introspective kanye and abrasive in your face kanye i love how it goes from the grandiose gospel intro that brought tears to my eyes to a line about a bleached asshole so much of it is chaos but i love how every part of it sounds even the interludes  i like them being there as a bit of breather i love how lyrically clunky kanye can be  sure it d be nice if he was better but his clunky lyrics  sound  good with the music  even if they do nt read the best  i for sure can see how it would turn people away  even longtime fans but i really appreciate kanye he can be such a prick  he loves stepping over the line and getting reactions  but i like that there s someone like that out there the guy is an artist who does nt compromise for better and worse whether he s releasing a bold album that actually works or just being self destructive  he s all in  so i m cool with this whole tidal fiasco it was a clusterfuck of an album release  if you can count it as an actual release with the tweet about  fixing  wolves it s interesting to watch go down though how people who got tickets to the yeezus season 3 thing still do nt have their copies  how much it s been pirated already  how allegedly it s not going to be anywhere else by next week we ll see what the real fallout of all this is  but you ca nt deny that it s entertaining to watch fall apart if you do nt take it personally especially since kanye has nt backpedaled yet  he s only doubled down  i ve moved almost primarily to streaming services for my music  so it ll be a bit of a drag if it really does stay tidal exclusive since i primarily use spotify but i m still in my postalbum release binge so it s not annoying yet when my tidal trial ends if it s not on spotify i ll probably not buy it immediately though it s a great album but there are so many other fantastic albums i have nt heard yet that i do nt have to pay extra for or deal with having the files locally  like how long it took hbo to let people without tvs pay them to watch any of their shows if you re not going to make it simple for me i will end up on the path of least resistance with their shows it was easier to pirate for my watch  but i have this free trial of tidal that i m going to use for now when that s done i d like to be able to keep listening to tlop  but i d be cool with having this month long fling with it that i can look back upon fondly  and yeezus hurt me with the shitposting weekend on rkanye during that failed release just kidding that was one of my favorite things i ve seen on the internet it s been a fun 5 days with tlop  even though we ve only had it for 3 of them ,d02lkob,music,entertainment,1455669384.0,CNUanMan,0.0,0.0,684,8917,0.0

does anyone know what they mean exactly by reclaim   as the artists  do they have a right or ability to pull tickets off those sites  or do they have to make a deal with the siteindividual sellers  im not sure how it works  but it seems like a really awesome thing for them to do so the fans have another chance to get them at a reasonable price ,463gqa,music,entertainment,1455643106.0,TheHow55,6.0,0.0,208,4989,0.0
it could mean a lot of different things  here s one scenario a lot of the biggest artists  could be the case for modest mouse   have very little control over their ticket sales  beyond saying they do nt want ticket prices to be over a certain amount others give lip service to having affordable tickets  but know they can get a lot more money if they hold some back labels know that people are willing to pay a lot more than that price  so they only release a small amount of tickets to regular sales  the majority of the tickets go to secondary ticket sellers at much higher prices or to other sources   http  nypostcom20130531whycantyouscoreconcerttixmaybebecauseasmanyas80percentofseatsareneverputonsale  it s quite possible that they somehow were able to work to change one of these deals ,d0235kf,music,entertainment,1455643674.0,yensid7,2.0,0.0,713,15192,0.0

i ve watched kendrick s performance probably 8 times already that was a legendary moment for hip hop in the 21st century k dot made a statement  ferociously and unapologetically  that his music is transcendent of what musicians  particularly black ones  can and should do within the confines of the music industry ,d01mqdg,music,entertainment,1455602951.0,Fergmasterflash,2.0,0.0,2492,3572,0.0
in light of the grammys both this year and years previous  i have a question for kendrick fans i seem to be missing the hype i consider myself a big fan of rap and have been for decades now kendrick s music does nt seem like anything special to me so when people talk and give him praise i feel like i m missing something  is it kendrick s message that is giving him attention or is it the actual music  i can understand if it s both i ve just felt that his music is subpar is it because of his support from dre  honest question because i absolutely can respect the meaning and context powerful words and verses that bring the subject matter to life just curious what others thought because i think i m alone when i say his music just is nt for me ,462eub,music,entertainment,1455629044.0,Simaul,86.0,0.0,1614,7128,0.0
i think it s the scope of his vision  the intellectual rigor of his rhymes  and the sonic ambition behind his releases tpab is an eightyminute hiphop concept album about depression and black identity in an age of black lives matters that combines spokenword poetry  hardbop and modal jazz influences  live instrumentation  and startling  introspective lyrics delivered with passion and technical precision it is daring  challenging music  dense with sonic and lyrical analogy  metaphor and allusion and it is a call for hiphop to rise to the sociopolitical and personal concerns of the present age it s attempting to innovate within its genre in the way that great ambitious  politically black albums in the past have  albums like the payback  whats goin on  there s a riot goin on  bitches brew  sign o the times  it takes a nation of millions to hold us back  yeezus  as for kendrick himself  there s something galvanizing about an unglamorous  seriousminded mc who delivers such consistent intensity and is willing to push the envelopesonically innovate in an age of  hotline bling   when people mistake future rapping  these fuckin  police ca nt touch me  these bogus police ca nt touch me  for woke  topical political content  kendrick seems really refreshing ,d01vle4,music,entertainment,1455631562.0,nottrapt,152.0,0.0,1,844,0.0
depends because how many hip hop albums have you heard line to pimp a butterfly with a strong jazz influence  it s not your typical banger  album but if anything  it offers much more on a sonic level and is more immersive as a result and that s without even thinking about the lyrics,d01wmvj,music,entertainment,1455633651.0,Dissonance3,6.0,0.0,1,843,0.0

solid question  and i think it goes without saying that this is subjective but i believe  kendrick is capturing a higher level of musicproduction  lyricism  both in meaning and in artistry of the lyrics via literary devices   flow  and appeal in  to pimp a butterfly  he demonstrates his deeprooted culture using facets like jazz  ramp  b  soul  funk  and of course  hiphop and rap i sincerely believe this album will go down as one of the best albums of all time  and i hope so not just in rap  but in all music the fact that he followed up an alreadyincredible album of  good kid  maad city  with an album that is only preceded in its number of nominations by michael jackson s  thriller  should speak for itself  but there s more to it the man s a genius and is backed by producers and other musicians who help that shine ,d0213do,music,entertainment,1455640774.0,WARHARSE,5.0,0.0,2,56,0.0
personally  i m a huge fan of progressive rock  blues  and jazz i find that kendrick is able to blend the lyricism  conceptualism  and experimental aspects associated with prog rock with the musicianship of blues and jazz the fact that he does this within the realm of hiphop is interesting to me because its definitely not something that you hear everyday ,d02iyvv,music,entertainment,1455665273.0,yougotowned,3.0,0.0,562,426,0.0

i consider myself a big hip hop fan as well and i ve never fully jumped on the kendrick hype train but he is the best thing in mainstream in years like he is a proper artist  it also makes me happy when i hear run the jewels beats on commercials because to me they are the best thing in hip hop at the moment ,d02hub5,music,entertainment,1455663551.0,JacobCrim88,2.0,0.0,3352,16677,1.0

with the past two grammy s he s been targeting situation that are going on in our society he has a bigger perspective of everything and he s targeting groups trying to give them more knowledge he brings a different grove a different swag then others his music is different then others honestly but if you can relate then you might like it he s just not targeting a situation your interested in ,d02sxoh,music,entertainment,1455680891.0,darius4902,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

i was like you i did nt like kendrick i thought his flow and delivery were weird i thought his voices were strange his style is extremely different from 80 s 90 s and 00 s rappers  last year i listened to tbap  and became a fan his weird rap style grew on me  and i started to  get  him things about him that stand out  1  his lyrical content he raps about many different topics  growing up in compton  struggles of the blackminority community  his distrust towards authority  whether that be the music industry  the police  the government  corporations   racial issues  his own struggles dealing with fame and fortune while trying to  keep it real   his other demons and personal issues  etc etc etc his songs usually have some double meaning theyre very dense and layered  2  his storytelling ability his songs are basically stories he is very descriptive and engaging good kid maad city is an album telling a story  yet each song can stand on its own tbap is similar  3  his flow at first it sounded weird to me  and offbeat but he has a catchy rapid fire delivery it s amazing to listen to he can rap slow too listen to alright  4  the music he uses good productioninstrumentals for his tracks tbap was full of jazz and funk gkmc was more hip hop  but still had unique beats ,d0275sf,music,entertainment,1455649108.0,xamountofaction,1.0,0.0,135,4541,0.0

yeah i would nt say that kendrick is a musical or hiphop innovator in any specific way  though he draws upon and blends older genres  boombap  soul  funk  jazz  in interesting ways  with the help of a whole host of collaborators   what makes him special is what he has to say  that he has become  in some ways against his will  a central voice of this generation he continues the hiphop tradition by meditating on his origins  and realizes that the struggles he has experienced are part of a larger national culturalpolitical struggle and he articulates this well  at times beautifully he is conscious without pushing an agendarather he inviting an audience to view his thoughts i also think that tpab was nt meant to be for everyone  that it was supposed to make people uncomfortable but i think the music  especially the critical  community was too afraid to admit this discomfort and  as a result  the album was instantly and universally lauded as a classic not that i do nt think it is  i do it s incredibly rich both is its music  its lyrical content  and its sociopolitical implications but i think its possible that the world s initial reaction to it has misrepresented it  and kendrick lamar himself or maybe the world was ready for it i ca nt say for sure ,d020bey,music,entertainment,1455639656.0,schwaza,4.0,0.0,1,1357,0.0
listen to gkmd it s much more palatable than tpab  and frankly much better it s the album that should have made him famous  but did nt tpab is  important   whatever that means  but it is nt that fun to listen to in my opinion obviously some tracks like king kunta and alright are an exception but gkmd works better as both an album and as individuals songs  if you want to know how tpab should have sounded  but did nt  watch him perform  untitled 2  on fallon that is some jazzinspired socially conscious hip hop that is actually fun to listen to over and over again ,d021dg1,music,entertainment,1455641169.0,MeBeingYouBeingMe,1.0,0.0,1,1648,0.0

i personally am a big fan of him for his music i just love the blend of jazz  funk  soul  hip hop  and spoken word i find the messages he conveys inspiring and i believe his lyricism is far ahead of many other rappers today he s a great person as well  he seems pretty down to earth he does nt really flash jewelry around or his fancy cars ,d01w249,music,entertainment,1455632521.0,DaftMemory,21.0,0.0,1370,4334,0.0

it s both  hii power   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rt2zcdpvlas  from section 80 basically sets the mainstream tone of what kendrick is about you combine conscious lyrics w mainstream appeal it makes for a more complete rapper kendrick is one of the few mc s that old heads and new heads respect because his lyrics are talking about something more powerful that what is usually talked about through mainstream channels ,d01uokq,music,entertainment,1455629492.0,jamills21,75.0,0.0,1037,13988,0.0
i m in a similar boat i totally respect kendrick as an incredible rapper  poet  and artist but i just ca nt get a handle on the musical aspect of his work granted  i m a pretty casual hiphop fan  but for reference  some of my favorite tracks   common  i used to love her   kanye west  never let me down  kanye west  two words  talib kweli  get by  the roots  what they do,d0248a4,music,entertainment,1455645148.0,Khuroh,8.0,0.0,1,13432,0.0
i m with you  op admittedly  i am not a huge raphip hop fan but i do like shit tons of songs from the genre it s just not my usual go to genre my biggest issue with him is i literally ca nt understand a word he is basically saying he raps so fast it just sounds like mumbling to me the stuff i could make out was great though if it s all about the message then i would like to hear the message without googling his lyrics and having to read it somewhere what s the point then  now  with all that said  i thought both his performances at the grammys the last couple years were awesome  the imagine dragons duo last year was pretty epic  the incorporating of the sax and the background music in his performance last night was super tight too i guess i really want to like him but the 100wpm rapping just turns me off to it maybe the studio versions are better ,d020aqj,music,entertainment,1455639629.0,kermitsio,6.0,0.0,20,3336,0.0
he is one of the most technically gifted rappers in the game  flow  rhymes  using clever metaphors and wordplay  versatility  inflection   and he s consistently used his talents to tell vivid  honest  important stories with a lot of depth and these stories happen to be very relevant to what america is talking about right now in race so right off the bat  you re getting an incredibly skilled and talented rapper  the music  using his voice to tell stories and make points that need to be heard  the message   now factor in that gkmc had top notch modern production  and tpab has an almost unprecedented mix of jazz  funk  rock  and straight up hip hop  and he s also pushing musical boundaries the jazz musicians he worked with on tpab compared him to the legendary john coltrane  saying that he had incredible vision and focus and was pushing everyone in the room to be their absolute best and work together in new musical directions  and that he s so gifted a rapper that he manages to keep his voice and flows and the meaning of the song at the forefront so he does nt just have great music and a great message  he s pushing music  and  the conversation into new territory ,d024qnv,music,entertainment,1455645838.0,whatswhat61,1.0,0.0,4784,58403,1.0

i have been struggling with this for the past couple days i have been checking out his music trying to see what i am missing i will still give his music a shot in the future but i do nt find his music pleasant to listen to i do nt listen to music for meaning by way of words  in fact some of my favorite songs do nt have words or the lyrics are unintelligible i would nt say you are missing the hype just that kendrick s style is not for everybody ,d02a5f1,music,entertainment,1455653121.0,solarflow,4.0,0.0,41,1358,0.0
i m personally not a huge fan of hiphop i mostly listen to metal  stuff like opeth  meshuggah  born of osiris  etc that said  i can appreciate talent and passion in other genres as well  which has led me to develop a taste for tech n9ne  tupac  and dre  i decided to give to pimp a butterfly a listen on the suggestion of a friend  and i ve been completely blown away it s my favorite album right now  i ca nt stop listening to it i m a big fan of jazz  so i love all the jazz elements he s using i think as a technical rapper  he s not quite at tech n9ne or eminem s level  but he s close what sets him apart  in my mind  is his lyrics they re pure poetry there are so many hidden meanings you have to figure out he does nt always spell out what he s saying  you have to piece it together  the entire album comes together into this powerful narrative about the institutionalizing of blacks in america a lot of what he talks about are well known topics  like the cia attempts to undermine the black community by distributing crack cocaine and setting gangs on each other it reminded me of tupac s lyric   give em guns  watch em kill each other  it s a fact that the prison population in the us is overwhelmingly black even if we assume that it s that way because blacks commit more crime  and not just because the judicial system is harder on them   then you have to understand that it s not because of their race  it s because the lower socioeconomic levels in this country are predominantly occupied by blacks when people are dirt poor  they sometimes become more desperate to pull themselves out of poverty  and are willing to commit crimes to do so and when there is an institutionalized pressure keeping a specific group in the lower class from rising  that group might go to even more drastic means to break through  you then have to ask yourself   why would the institution  target blacks like this   the answer is another major theme kendrick touches on in the album there are still a lot of really racist people out there who genuinely hate black people and view them as subhuman you would think opinions like these would be gone in our enlightened age  but they still flourish people are just less open about it  generally i ve dated a couple black girls in the past  and i honestly could nt believe some of the things that happen to them being stopped by police for no apparent reason people refusing them service  or customers at their place of work requesting a white person help them i would nt have believed it if i had nt seen it for myself multiple times and this is what the black community faces each and every day  so  what are they to do to overcome this systematic opposition  the answer is another major theme of the album  the black community needs to stop fighting amongst themselves and unify to improve their lot being a big tupac fan  this message really resonated with me  as this was a major theme of tupac s lyrics the album  i feel  leaves you with a feeling of hope  that this is something that is within reach  just to specify  i am a white male born into a middle class family  but kendrick s message really opened my eyes to what black america experiences every day and i think that was his real goal  not only does he want to sound a rally cry for the black community to unite  but he wants to open the eyes of the white community  and make them see that there is still a problem with systematic and institutionalized racism in america that needs to be addressed so  i love this album for the great music  production  and rapping  but i think it will go down as an alltime great because of the powerful message in contains hopefully that was helpful to you ,d02lbev,music,entertainment,1455669003.0,Wraithpk,3.0,0.0,471,17050,0.0

interesting that you say this i do nt care about lyrics very much at all  but i still became absorbed in tpab lyrically more on point though  i genuinely think tpab is an incredible album musically  and the best rap album i ve ever heard i ve never heard anything so creative in hip hop before i do not like good kid maad city nearly as much  because it s mostly just standard rapping with clean and standard beats  even if it s done very well that and the whole conceit of making songs that are generic and sound generic but are somehow better because they have nongeneric lyrics  swimming pools  i do nt care about your lyrics enough to let you get away with calling a bad song good  kendrick luckily tpab does not compromise creatively in terms of music or lyrics  and that makes it the full package for me ,d025kk1,music,entertainment,1455646971.0,Evilknightz,1.0,0.0,2099,14754,0.0

if he s as broke as he claims he is  then he s handling this like a complete moron his huge ego is getting the best of him  he thinks people are going to throw money at tidal just to hear his album get off your high horse  mr west  if you pigeonhole your customers into doing something they do nt want to  you re lumping your wouldbe customers into two groups  1 people who wanted to buy your album  but do nt want to put forth the effortmoney to sign up for a streaming service just to hear a single album  2 people who will find ways around it and get your album anyway  piracy   since only your most diehard fans are likely the ones who are going to sign up for tidal and actually  keep  the service after the trial  you re going to be left with very little    but since his label is nt that stupid  he s really just saying this as a publicity stunt   this is how it will pan out   says album will never be released  tidal reports record number of new signups   majority of those signups ultimately do nt renew  tidalhis record label realizes they re leaving a lot of money on the table by not diversifying avenues to purchase the album   kanye announces it s available on itunesgoogle playspotifywhatever  the above will pan out in the next month or so  he s already done the damage in regards to sales those who actually were anxiously waiting on the album have probably already pirated it i d be shocked if even 1015  of those who already pirated it will go back and purchase it when it becomes available ,d01i72e,music,entertainment,1455594253.0,OpossumSemen,30.0,0.0,67,10942,0.0

i think everyone saying everyone is just going to torrent it now  is mistakenly forgetting that many many music consumers do nt have experience torrenting and do nt know how to do it especially the teenage demographic that make up a huge chunk of his fan base  those same people that do nt know how to torrent and do nt have the savvy to figure it out happen to know how to sign up for services with their moms debit card  yes this is a huge mistake and makes him look really stupid and will not result in tidal becoming relevant  the funniest part to me is that tidal offers a 30 day free trialso what do you think people who are forced to use it to hear one album are going to do  and they will not renew because it is actually a sub par steaming service   but the average kanye west fan does not torrent music and likely will not try to figure it out instead of just doing what kanye tells them to do  and signing up for tidal  the free trial  lol   just my 02,d01pgck,music,entertainment,1455610783.0,spinblackcircles,0.0,0.0,512,23458,1.0

i suggest replacing one of three songs by guns n roses and put in a song by earth  wind amp  fire some options   fantasy    september    getaway    shining star   i would also put another song by prince  maybe from his early albums or from his sign o  the times album i also think  what s going on  by marvin gaye is essential  and i would put more songs from female performers  some i did nt see  aretha franklin  diana ross  solo andor with the supremes   tina turner solo  cher  whitney houston  mariah carey  janet jackson all those have great andor distinctive voices janet was especially influential in developping the  new jack swing  sound with jimmy jam and terry lewis you could remove one song by nirvana or some other artists with more than two or three songs for more variety some others from the modern ramp  b side  r kelly  usher  alicia keys songs from great modern producers like timbaland or pharrellthe neptunes are also missing i think not a bad list overall though ,d0273ki,music,entertainment,1455649028.0,chamotruche,6.0,0.0,1,604,0.0

at first i was nt going to read 300 songs then i got to the comments and had to go back to read what you put then i was nt going to comment  thinking that you would nt read it  or respond i ca nt stop thinking about the list  so here is my input  i think it s a great list i can see some of your personal preferences have made it in there and that s going to happen  like ruiner instead of head like a hole or hurt by nin   also  i can see where some people will want you to take out x artist of a genre to put in y artist of the same genre that will be a hard decision on your part  welp  here is my two cents on what to put in  black crows jealous or she talks to angels garth brooks thunder rolls or friends in low places ludacris what s your fantasy  since he is 10  maybe rollout  nelly ride wit me sinead oconner nothing compares  i know she did nt write it but dang it s a great version and the most popular  jeff buckley lover  you should have come over etta james at last nina simone feeling good soggy bottom boys i am a man of constant sorrow pantera cowboys from hell  or since he is only 10 years old this love  r kelly i believe i can fly seal kiss from a rose or crazy steve miller band anything by them stone temple pilots creep or plush or big empty or interstate love song styx come sail away the verve let love be your energy 311 all mixed up some songs to consider taking out  walking the cow yo la tengo  can replace with neutral milk hotel  mia yaz my chemical romance  kind of a small genre that was filled with better bands like thursday  thrice  the used  finch  kid rock garbage  easily replaced by the cranberries  also  some bands can be taken down a notch a beatles song can be taken out to make way for a single artist and you ll still have 4 beatles songs  anyway  great list and kudos on your for taking the time to do this everyone s list would be completely different the great thing is you get the last vote ,d02ccoe,music,entertainment,1455656015.0,kittenpuppystarwars,5.0,0.0,213,308,0.0

obviously any list is going to be subjective but i think it would ve been helpful if there was at least some kind of methodology to how you picked these songs that is if you want this list to be a representative cross section of music across multiple eras if you just want a list of the  greatest  songs then you can have him a copy of that issue of rolling stone and just fill in the last couple of years yourself  i would start by increasing the size of the list 300 sounds like a lot but it s really not and your kid has time to listen i ve heard just about every song on your list some of them maybe hundreds of times  then i would limit the number of songs from each year maybe to ten or so yes some years have been better for music than others but there are certainly ten great songs from every year dating back to the beginning of the last century  though i would nt go that far back   if your worried this would exclude a lot of songs  well  thats inevitable  once you narrow it down by year it is a lot easier to create a diverse list because you are nt comparing songs from 2015 to songs from 1965 and obviously that criteria will evolve as you move through the years early on you ll want to include motown  then ditch that for disco  add in some hip hop later on and then edm even later on ,d02kaad,music,entertainment,1455667406.0,U2_is_gay,1.0,0.0,1255,65801,0.0

i m personally not a huge fan of hiphop i mostly listen to metal  stuff like opeth  meshuggah  born of osiris  etc that said  i can appreciate talent and passion in other genres as well  which has led me to develop a taste for tech n9ne  tupac  and dre  i decided to give to pimp a butterfly a listen on the suggestion of a friend  and i ve been completely blown away it s my favorite album right now  i ca nt stop listening to it i m a big fan of jazz  so i love all the jazz elements he s using i think as a technical rapper  he s not quite at tech n9ne or eminem s level  but he s close what sets him apart  in my mind  is his lyrics they re pure poetry there are so many hidden meanings you have to figure out he does nt always spell out what he s saying  you have to piece it together  the entire album comes together into this powerful narrative about the institutionalizing of blacks in america a lot of what he talks about are well known topics  like the cia attempts to undermine the black community by distributing crack cocaine and setting gangs on each other it reminded me of tupac s lyric   give em guns  watch em kill each other  it s a fact that the prison population in the us is overwhelmingly black even if we assume that it s that way because blacks commit more crime  and not just because the judicial system is harder on them   then you have to understand that it s not because of their race  it s because the lower socioeconomic levels in this country are predominantly occupied by blacks when people are dirt poor  they sometimes become more desperate to pull themselves out of poverty  and are willing to commit crimes to do so and when there is an institutionalized pressure keeping a specific group in the lower class from rising  that group might go to even more drastic means to break through  you then have to ask yourself   why would the institution  target blacks like this   the answer is another major theme kendrick touches on in the album there are still a lot of really racist people out there who genuinely hate black people and view them as subhuman you would think opinions like these would be gone in our enlightened age  but they still flourish people are just less open about it  generally i ve dated a couple black girls in the past  and i honestly could nt believe some of the things that happen to them being stopped by police for no apparent reason people refusing them service  or customers at their place of work requesting a white person help them i would nt have believed it if i had nt seen it for myself multiple times and this is what the black community faces each and every day  so  what are they to do to overcome this systematic opposition  the answer is another major theme of the album  the black community needs to stop fighting amongst themselves and unify to improve their lot being a big tupac fan  this message really resonated with me  as this was a major theme of tupac s lyrics the album  i feel  leaves you with a feeling of hope  that this is something that is within reach  just to specify  i am a white male born into a middle class family  but kendrick s message really opened my eyes to what black america experiences every day and i think that was his real goal  not only does he want to sound a rally cry for the black community to unite  but he wants to open the eyes of the white community  and make them see that there is still a problem with systematic and institutionalized racism in america that needs to be addressed so  i love this album for the great music  production  and rapping  but i think it will go down as an alltime great because of the powerful message in contains hopefully that was helpful to you ,d02lbev,music,entertainment,1455669003.0,Wraithpk,3.0,0.0,471,17050,0.0
mixture of both his message and his music for sure when i first listened to to pimp a butterfly  i did nt know what to think of it definitely was nt a fan at first  but as a jazz musician i could definitely appreciate what was going on on the backing tracks  listen to for free  holy shit that combo absolutely kills it on that track   it took a few listens before i started understanding the content  and i began to like it more and more it s definitely an acquired taste  i feel personally  i think the way his lyrics line up with the music is borderline genius specifically on alright the syncopation of the backing track under his vocals makes for a super cool texture gets me hyped every time i know my view is definitely different from others  but it s more or less directly related to my background prior to hearing it  edit  if you want a grasp of his content look up the lyrics to  u  and  the blacker the berry   super powerful i could nt listen to  u  all the way through the first time i heard it it hit too close to home ,d01wkl5,music,entertainment,1455633529.0,majorjazzhole,70.0,0.0,386,293,0.0

obviously any list is going to be subjective but i think it would ve been helpful if there was at least some kind of methodology to how you picked these songs that is if you want this list to be a representative cross section of music across multiple eras if you just want a list of the  greatest  songs then you can have him a copy of that issue of rolling stone and just fill in the last couple of years yourself  i would start by increasing the size of the list 300 sounds like a lot but it s really not and your kid has time to listen i ve heard just about every song on your list some of them maybe hundreds of times  then i would limit the number of songs from each year maybe to ten or so yes some years have been better for music than others but there are certainly ten great songs from every year dating back to the beginning of the last century  though i would nt go that far back   if your worried this would exclude a lot of songs  well  thats inevitable  once you narrow it down by year it is a lot easier to create a diverse list because you are nt comparing songs from 2015 to songs from 1965 and obviously that criteria will evolve as you move through the years early on you ll want to include motown  then ditch that for disco  add in some hip hop later on and then edm even later on ,d02kaad,music,entertainment,1455667406.0,U2_is_gay,1.0,0.0,1255,65801,0.0
i was nt going to read the list  but i had to after reading all the comments so here are my two cents i tried being as objective as possible  though some of these artists are definitely some of my favorite  the beatles probably do nt need to have 6 songs in the list  i d stick with at least 5  but maybe 4  though i do nt know which ones i d remove  for black sabbath  i d probably replace iron man with paranoid alice cooper  school s out instead of i m eighteen creedence clearwater revival  bad moon rising  proud mary  or fortunate son instead of susie q the doors  light my fire instead of break on through eric clapton  cocaine instead of it s in the way that you use it fleetwood mac  something from the eighties instead of one the songs  since they re both from rumours genesis  great choice  they re pretty much my favorite band  but maybe either choose something a little more prog rock  or something more eighties  since those are their big genres  led zeppelin  communication breakdown can be substituted by another bandartist maybe a lionel richie song  either hello  or all night long michael jackson  thriller instead of beat it neil young  include old man or down by the river instead of one of the others outkast  ms jackson instead of hey ya patti smith  because the night instead of free money prince  purple rain instead of little red corvette since you have donna summer  chic would be a cool choice to also include  and maybe earth  wind amp  fire  i d also include something from supertramp s breakfast in america and one from jamiroquai  like virtual insanity  and one boyband and girlband  like backstreet boys and spice girls  also sorry for the long comment ,d02hvmk,music,entertainment,1455663606.0,ruteds,3.0,0.0,1,12,0.0

in light of the grammys both this year and years previous  i have a question for kendrick fans i seem to be missing the hype i consider myself a big fan of rap and have been for decades now kendrick s music does nt seem like anything special to me so when people talk and give him praise i feel like i m missing something  is it kendrick s message that is giving him attention or is it the actual music  i can understand if it s both i ve just felt that his music is subpar is it because of his support from dre  honest question because i absolutely can respect the meaning and context powerful words and verses that bring the subject matter to life just curious what others thought because i think i m alone when i say his music just is nt for me ,462eub,music,entertainment,1455629044.0,Simaul,86.0,0.0,1614,7128,0.0
mixture of both his message and his music for sure when i first listened to to pimp a butterfly  i did nt know what to think of it definitely was nt a fan at first  but as a jazz musician i could definitely appreciate what was going on on the backing tracks  listen to for free  holy shit that combo absolutely kills it on that track   it took a few listens before i started understanding the content  and i began to like it more and more it s definitely an acquired taste  i feel personally  i think the way his lyrics line up with the music is borderline genius specifically on alright the syncopation of the backing track under his vocals makes for a super cool texture gets me hyped every time i know my view is definitely different from others  but it s more or less directly related to my background prior to hearing it  edit  if you want a grasp of his content look up the lyrics to  u  and  the blacker the berry   super powerful i could nt listen to  u  all the way through the first time i heard it it hit too close to home ,d01wkl5,music,entertainment,1455633529.0,majorjazzhole,70.0,0.0,386,293,0.0
i think it s the scope of his vision  the intellectual rigor of his rhymes  and the sonic ambition behind his releases tpab is an eightyminute hiphop concept album about depression and black identity in an age of black lives matters that combines spokenword poetry  hardbop and modal jazz influences  live instrumentation  and startling  introspective lyrics delivered with passion and technical precision it is daring  challenging music  dense with sonic and lyrical analogy  metaphor and allusion and it is a call for hiphop to rise to the sociopolitical and personal concerns of the present age it s attempting to innovate within its genre in the way that great ambitious  politically black albums in the past have  albums like the payback  whats goin on  there s a riot goin on  bitches brew  sign o the times  it takes a nation of millions to hold us back  yeezus  as for kendrick himself  there s something galvanizing about an unglamorous  seriousminded mc who delivers such consistent intensity and is willing to push the envelopesonically innovate in an age of  hotline bling   when people mistake future rapping  these fuckin  police ca nt touch me  these bogus police ca nt touch me  for woke  topical political content  kendrick seems really refreshing ,d01vle4,music,entertainment,1455631562.0,nottrapt,152.0,0.0,1,844,0.0
it s both  hii power   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rt2zcdpvlas  from section 80 basically sets the mainstream tone of what kendrick is about you combine conscious lyrics w mainstream appeal it makes for a more complete rapper kendrick is one of the few mc s that old heads and new heads respect because his lyrics are talking about something more powerful that what is usually talked about through mainstream channels ,d01uokq,music,entertainment,1455629492.0,jamills21,75.0,0.0,1037,13988,0.0
i personally am a big fan of him for his music i just love the blend of jazz  funk  soul  hip hop  and spoken word i find the messages he conveys inspiring and i believe his lyricism is far ahead of many other rappers today he s a great person as well  he seems pretty down to earth he does nt really flash jewelry around or his fancy cars ,d01w249,music,entertainment,1455632521.0,DaftMemory,21.0,0.0,1370,4334,0.0
depends because how many hip hop albums have you heard line to pimp a butterfly with a strong jazz influence  it s not your typical banger  album but if anything  it offers much more on a sonic level and is more immersive as a result and that s without even thinking about the lyrics,d01wmvj,music,entertainment,1455633651.0,Dissonance3,6.0,0.0,1,843,0.0
i m in a similar boat i totally respect kendrick as an incredible rapper  poet  and artist but i just ca nt get a handle on the musical aspect of his work granted  i m a pretty casual hiphop fan  but for reference  some of my favorite tracks   common  i used to love her   kanye west  never let me down  kanye west  two words  talib kweli  get by  the roots  what they do,d0248a4,music,entertainment,1455645148.0,Khuroh,8.0,0.0,1,13432,0.0

i have been struggling with this for the past couple days i have been checking out his music trying to see what i am missing i will still give his music a shot in the future but i do nt find his music pleasant to listen to i do nt listen to music for meaning by way of words  in fact some of my favorite songs do nt have words or the lyrics are unintelligible i would nt say you are missing the hype just that kendrick s style is not for everybody ,d02a5f1,music,entertainment,1455653121.0,solarflow,4.0,0.0,41,1358,0.0

solid question  and i think it goes without saying that this is subjective but i believe  kendrick is capturing a higher level of musicproduction  lyricism  both in meaning and in artistry of the lyrics via literary devices   flow  and appeal in  to pimp a butterfly  he demonstrates his deeprooted culture using facets like jazz  ramp  b  soul  funk  and of course  hiphop and rap i sincerely believe this album will go down as one of the best albums of all time  and i hope so not just in rap  but in all music the fact that he followed up an alreadyincredible album of  good kid  maad city  with an album that is only preceded in its number of nominations by michael jackson s  thriller  should speak for itself  but there s more to it the man s a genius and is backed by producers and other musicians who help that shine ,d0213do,music,entertainment,1455640774.0,WARHARSE,5.0,0.0,2,56,0.0
personally  i m a huge fan of progressive rock  blues  and jazz i find that kendrick is able to blend the lyricism  conceptualism  and experimental aspects associated with prog rock with the musicianship of blues and jazz the fact that he does this within the realm of hiphop is interesting to me because its definitely not something that you hear everyday ,d02iyvv,music,entertainment,1455665273.0,yougotowned,3.0,0.0,562,426,0.0
i m personally not a huge fan of hiphop i mostly listen to metal  stuff like opeth  meshuggah  born of osiris  etc that said  i can appreciate talent and passion in other genres as well  which has led me to develop a taste for tech n9ne  tupac  and dre  i decided to give to pimp a butterfly a listen on the suggestion of a friend  and i ve been completely blown away it s my favorite album right now  i ca nt stop listening to it i m a big fan of jazz  so i love all the jazz elements he s using i think as a technical rapper  he s not quite at tech n9ne or eminem s level  but he s close what sets him apart  in my mind  is his lyrics they re pure poetry there are so many hidden meanings you have to figure out he does nt always spell out what he s saying  you have to piece it together  the entire album comes together into this powerful narrative about the institutionalizing of blacks in america a lot of what he talks about are well known topics  like the cia attempts to undermine the black community by distributing crack cocaine and setting gangs on each other it reminded me of tupac s lyric   give em guns  watch em kill each other  it s a fact that the prison population in the us is overwhelmingly black even if we assume that it s that way because blacks commit more crime  and not just because the judicial system is harder on them   then you have to understand that it s not because of their race  it s because the lower socioeconomic levels in this country are predominantly occupied by blacks when people are dirt poor  they sometimes become more desperate to pull themselves out of poverty  and are willing to commit crimes to do so and when there is an institutionalized pressure keeping a specific group in the lower class from rising  that group might go to even more drastic means to break through  you then have to ask yourself   why would the institution  target blacks like this   the answer is another major theme kendrick touches on in the album there are still a lot of really racist people out there who genuinely hate black people and view them as subhuman you would think opinions like these would be gone in our enlightened age  but they still flourish people are just less open about it  generally i ve dated a couple black girls in the past  and i honestly could nt believe some of the things that happen to them being stopped by police for no apparent reason people refusing them service  or customers at their place of work requesting a white person help them i would nt have believed it if i had nt seen it for myself multiple times and this is what the black community faces each and every day  so  what are they to do to overcome this systematic opposition  the answer is another major theme of the album  the black community needs to stop fighting amongst themselves and unify to improve their lot being a big tupac fan  this message really resonated with me  as this was a major theme of tupac s lyrics the album  i feel  leaves you with a feeling of hope  that this is something that is within reach  just to specify  i am a white male born into a middle class family  but kendrick s message really opened my eyes to what black america experiences every day and i think that was his real goal  not only does he want to sound a rally cry for the black community to unite  but he wants to open the eyes of the white community  and make them see that there is still a problem with systematic and institutionalized racism in america that needs to be addressed so  i love this album for the great music  production  and rapping  but i think it will go down as an alltime great because of the powerful message in contains hopefully that was helpful to you ,d02lbev,music,entertainment,1455669003.0,Wraithpk,3.0,0.0,471,17050,0.0
yeah i would nt say that kendrick is a musical or hiphop innovator in any specific way  though he draws upon and blends older genres  boombap  soul  funk  jazz  in interesting ways  with the help of a whole host of collaborators   what makes him special is what he has to say  that he has become  in some ways against his will  a central voice of this generation he continues the hiphop tradition by meditating on his origins  and realizes that the struggles he has experienced are part of a larger national culturalpolitical struggle and he articulates this well  at times beautifully he is conscious without pushing an agendarather he inviting an audience to view his thoughts i also think that tpab was nt meant to be for everyone  that it was supposed to make people uncomfortable but i think the music  especially the critical  community was too afraid to admit this discomfort and  as a result  the album was instantly and universally lauded as a classic not that i do nt think it is  i do it s incredibly rich both is its music  its lyrical content  and its sociopolitical implications but i think its possible that the world s initial reaction to it has misrepresented it  and kendrick lamar himself or maybe the world was ready for it i ca nt say for sure ,d020bey,music,entertainment,1455639656.0,schwaza,4.0,0.0,1,1357,0.0
i m with you  op admittedly  i am not a huge raphip hop fan but i do like shit tons of songs from the genre it s just not my usual go to genre my biggest issue with him is i literally ca nt understand a word he is basically saying he raps so fast it just sounds like mumbling to me the stuff i could make out was great though if it s all about the message then i would like to hear the message without googling his lyrics and having to read it somewhere what s the point then  now  with all that said  i thought both his performances at the grammys the last couple years were awesome  the imagine dragons duo last year was pretty epic  the incorporating of the sax and the background music in his performance last night was super tight too i guess i really want to like him but the 100wpm rapping just turns me off to it maybe the studio versions are better ,d020aqj,music,entertainment,1455639629.0,kermitsio,6.0,0.0,20,3336,0.0

i consider myself a big hip hop fan as well and i ve never fully jumped on the kendrick hype train but he is the best thing in mainstream in years like he is a proper artist  it also makes me happy when i hear run the jewels beats on commercials because to me they are the best thing in hip hop at the moment ,d02hub5,music,entertainment,1455663551.0,JacobCrim88,2.0,0.0,3352,16677,1.0

interesting that you say this i do nt care about lyrics very much at all  but i still became absorbed in tpab lyrically more on point though  i genuinely think tpab is an incredible album musically  and the best rap album i ve ever heard i ve never heard anything so creative in hip hop before i do not like good kid maad city nearly as much  because it s mostly just standard rapping with clean and standard beats  even if it s done very well that and the whole conceit of making songs that are generic and sound generic but are somehow better because they have nongeneric lyrics  swimming pools  i do nt care about your lyrics enough to let you get away with calling a bad song good  kendrick luckily tpab does not compromise creatively in terms of music or lyrics  and that makes it the full package for me ,d025kk1,music,entertainment,1455646971.0,Evilknightz,1.0,0.0,2099,14754,0.0

i was like you i did nt like kendrick i thought his flow and delivery were weird i thought his voices were strange his style is extremely different from 80 s 90 s and 00 s rappers  last year i listened to tbap  and became a fan his weird rap style grew on me  and i started to  get  him things about him that stand out  1  his lyrical content he raps about many different topics  growing up in compton  struggles of the blackminority community  his distrust towards authority  whether that be the music industry  the police  the government  corporations   racial issues  his own struggles dealing with fame and fortune while trying to  keep it real   his other demons and personal issues  etc etc etc his songs usually have some double meaning theyre very dense and layered  2  his storytelling ability his songs are basically stories he is very descriptive and engaging good kid maad city is an album telling a story  yet each song can stand on its own tbap is similar  3  his flow at first it sounded weird to me  and offbeat but he has a catchy rapid fire delivery it s amazing to listen to he can rap slow too listen to alright  4  the music he uses good productioninstrumentals for his tracks tbap was full of jazz and funk gkmc was more hip hop  but still had unique beats ,d0275sf,music,entertainment,1455649108.0,xamountofaction,1.0,0.0,135,4541,0.0

with the past two grammy s he s been targeting situation that are going on in our society he has a bigger perspective of everything and he s targeting groups trying to give them more knowledge he brings a different grove a different swag then others his music is different then others honestly but if you can relate then you might like it he s just not targeting a situation your interested in ,d02sxoh,music,entertainment,1455680891.0,darius4902,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
listen to gkmd it s much more palatable than tpab  and frankly much better it s the album that should have made him famous  but did nt tpab is  important   whatever that means  but it is nt that fun to listen to in my opinion obviously some tracks like king kunta and alright are an exception but gkmd works better as both an album and as individuals songs  if you want to know how tpab should have sounded  but did nt  watch him perform  untitled 2  on fallon that is some jazzinspired socially conscious hip hop that is actually fun to listen to over and over again ,d021dg1,music,entertainment,1455641169.0,MeBeingYouBeingMe,1.0,0.0,1,1648,0.0
he is one of the most technically gifted rappers in the game  flow  rhymes  using clever metaphors and wordplay  versatility  inflection   and he s consistently used his talents to tell vivid  honest  important stories with a lot of depth and these stories happen to be very relevant to what america is talking about right now in race so right off the bat  you re getting an incredibly skilled and talented rapper  the music  using his voice to tell stories and make points that need to be heard  the message   now factor in that gkmc had top notch modern production  and tpab has an almost unprecedented mix of jazz  funk  rock  and straight up hip hop  and he s also pushing musical boundaries the jazz musicians he worked with on tpab compared him to the legendary john coltrane  saying that he had incredible vision and focus and was pushing everyone in the room to be their absolute best and work together in new musical directions  and that he s so gifted a rapper that he manages to keep his voice and flows and the meaning of the song at the forefront so he does nt just have great music and a great message  he s pushing music  and  the conversation into new territory ,d024qnv,music,entertainment,1455645838.0,whatswhat61,1.0,0.0,4784,58403,1.0

i think everyone saying everyone is just going to torrent it now  is mistakenly forgetting that many many music consumers do nt have experience torrenting and do nt know how to do it especially the teenage demographic that make up a huge chunk of his fan base  those same people that do nt know how to torrent and do nt have the savvy to figure it out happen to know how to sign up for services with their moms debit card  yes this is a huge mistake and makes him look really stupid and will not result in tidal becoming relevant  the funniest part to me is that tidal offers a 30 day free trialso what do you think people who are forced to use it to hear one album are going to do  and they will not renew because it is actually a sub par steaming service   but the average kanye west fan does not torrent music and likely will not try to figure it out instead of just doing what kanye tells them to do  and signing up for tidal  the free trial  lol   just my 02,d01pgck,music,entertainment,1455610783.0,spinblackcircles,0.0,0.0,512,23458,1.0

finally a thread the mods have nt locked yet last night reminded me just how talentless mainstream modern music is except for gary clark jr  alice cooper  and gaga  most of the people who performed were awful and to give the best new artist award to meghan trainor over james bay or courtney barnett  are you kidding me ,d01w14a,music,entertainment,1455632464.0,JerkwaterJeff666,6.0,0.0,45,4911,0.0
the two highlights of the show happened in sequence for me they had the bb king tribute  where bonnie raitt  who still sounds amazing at 67 years old  and gary clark jr did a terrific rendition of  the thrill is gone   then alabama shakes had their performance debut and absolutely nailed it brittney howard just commands all of your attention  i was really happy for the shakes i think they gained a lot of new fans last night because their music does nt really fit into a format where a lot of people get to hear it casually ,d01vvsv,music,entertainment,1455632164.0,ToxicAdamm,8.0,0.0,7,36764,0.0

i think everyone saying everyone is just going to torrent it now  is mistakenly forgetting that many many music consumers do nt have experience torrenting and do nt know how to do it especially the teenage demographic that make up a huge chunk of his fan base  those same people that do nt know how to torrent and do nt have the savvy to figure it out happen to know how to sign up for services with their moms debit card  yes this is a huge mistake and makes him look really stupid and will not result in tidal becoming relevant  the funniest part to me is that tidal offers a 30 day free trialso what do you think people who are forced to use it to hear one album are going to do  and they will not renew because it is actually a sub par steaming service   but the average kanye west fan does not torrent music and likely will not try to figure it out instead of just doing what kanye tells them to do  and signing up for tidal  the free trial  lol   just my 02,d01pgck,music,entertainment,1455610783.0,spinblackcircles,0.0,0.0,512,23458,1.0

if he s as broke as he claims he is  then he s handling this like a complete moron his huge ego is getting the best of him  he thinks people are going to throw money at tidal just to hear his album get off your high horse  mr west  if you pigeonhole your customers into doing something they do nt want to  you re lumping your wouldbe customers into two groups  1 people who wanted to buy your album  but do nt want to put forth the effortmoney to sign up for a streaming service just to hear a single album  2 people who will find ways around it and get your album anyway  piracy   since only your most diehard fans are likely the ones who are going to sign up for tidal and actually  keep  the service after the trial  you re going to be left with very little    but since his label is nt that stupid  he s really just saying this as a publicity stunt   this is how it will pan out   says album will never be released  tidal reports record number of new signups   majority of those signups ultimately do nt renew  tidalhis record label realizes they re leaving a lot of money on the table by not diversifying avenues to purchase the album   kanye announces it s available on itunesgoogle playspotifywhatever  the above will pan out in the next month or so  he s already done the damage in regards to sales those who actually were anxiously waiting on the album have probably already pirated it i d be shocked if even 1015  of those who already pirated it will go back and purchase it when it becomes available ,d01i72e,music,entertainment,1455594253.0,OpossumSemen,30.0,0.0,67,10942,0.0
