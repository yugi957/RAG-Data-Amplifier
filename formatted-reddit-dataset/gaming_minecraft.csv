this is a repost with pics   original information   i took a dropper  hopper combo from a popular afk fishing farm  and tried applying it to my grinder to dispense swords  it s one dropper facing up into another facing out  to where i m standing   i stand on a hopper which feeds into the bottom dispenser  i also have 3 hoppers that link into the hopper i m standing on  coming from a chest of swords  the problem is  the hopper i m standing on picks up the sword before my character picks it up i think it might have something to do with setting  s  on the server where hoppers seem to pick up items faster than vanilla  andor players do nt pick up dropped items as fast  anyways  i m trying to figure out how i can rig it so that the hopper i m standing on does nt pick up the item so quick not sure how i could do that probably with some other red stone somewhere but it would have to be linked and timed with the clock that is dispensing the swords every  6 seconds    added information    here   http  imgurcomaambrf  i added a redstone signal to the receiving hopper  img1   the one i stand under   while active  this should prevent the hopper from sending an item  the hopper is full of swords   so as a result it can not pick up the dispensed sword until the redstone signal is deactivated  img2   works perfectly the problem i m actually having  now   is that the adjacent hopper  identified with pink wool block  img3   img4  is somehow  through the cobblestone covering it  picking up the sword  so my solution was  simply fill that hopper with swords too  it wo nt pick it up  yay it worked   but   now no hoppers pick up swords  because what happens is  when the redstone signal locking the hopper breaks  img2   the pink wool hopper prioritizes by sending a sword to that hopper  instead of the hopper picking up the sword  so effectively  the dispenser just keeps dispensing swords and they all sit on top of the hopper ,4648pm,minecraft,gaming,1455652425.0,Illsonmedia,0.0,0.0,389,1907,0.0

bit of free build advice to people  although a lot of them will know it already   one thing i hear mentioned a lot to people who are just starting to seek build advice is the  do nt make it all one block  thing mojang s villages are a good example of this even without counting doors  windows  stairs  etc most of their village buildings are made of 3 types of blocks  cobblestone  oak planks  oak logs they will often follow a rule of  do nt make the walls and the floor the same material   so you ll get cobble floors with plank walls  or vice versa   or they ll make the bottom block of the wall the same as the floor to simulate wainscottingkickerboards the logs usually show up as support pillars on the corners of the house even if you use different materials the general idea of having support pillars as an excuse for a different block is a good idea  also if you have nt noticed it yet  those stairbased roofs prevent monsters from spawning on them same with slab roofs so long as it s bottomhalf slabs  although villages do nt use slabs only stairs   mind you they did nt have corner stairs when they designed the villages so they used planks instead which can spawn darkness monsters ,czta5lh,minecraft,gaming,1455010105.0,WildBluntHickok,16.0,0.0,3842,19331,0.0

one note to give people about building is that flat  crap if you want your build to pop out and impress others  make it 2 or even 3 blocks deep this way  you can add extra blocks to the outside  and make it seem more detailed than just a flat wall  another note added to this is the notion  oh  i m terrible at building  so i ll never make anything good to show off  many of the great builders we see referenced today on the server started out with a similar mindset  find your build style maybe you re not a modernistic type builder  but can make building set in the old west very well or maybe you re good at bridges  but ca nt make walls to save your life find the niche that you fit into for your builds  and start expanding your mind on how to make it unique to you  ,cztcdx3,minecraft,gaming,1455019469.0,billyK_,3.0,0.0,18839,122352,0.0

flat is not always bad if you are making smaller builds like houses 1 deep is more than enough i hate when someone builds a 15x10 house and it has like 34 deep walls with over the top details that look worse than better  so if you are building small things  dont try to fit as many details as possible sometimes less is better  try to take a topdown approach and slowly add more and more details  but again be reasonable not every build must be eye catching  also check some google images of builds you want to build ingame wan na do a medieval themed house  google it it will give you an idea how it should look  additionally try to use  realistic  materials dont use wool as the walls or make roofs that look more massive than your main house ,cztfhyi,minecraft,gaming,1455027648.0,_mrx16,8.0,0.0,2090,741,0.0

the new spacebar to deploy elytra  in air is an improvement no more crazy camera jitter while wearing it and walking down a mountain or jumping down three blocks you can still speedily descend into your safefall  while wearing elytra now  if you choose could also enable some new pvp escape tactics  perhaps  i ve seen some folks say it would be cool if you could spacebar again to toggle them again to turn them back off this might be cool  but without clear feedback about the deployment state  it might have unintended consequences  eg you jump off a cliff  think you hit space but you still seem to be falling  so you hit space again  but actually you were just lagging and had already deployed the wings  and the second spacebar now turned them back off  depending on how it s implemented so i m not sure about a spacetotoggle mechanic maybe shift  could turn it off again   it might also be useful if there was a thwoomp  soundeffect of the wings catching air to offer audio feedback about the deployment  perhaps ,d00rxcg,minecraft,gaming,1455554552.0,brianmcn,62.0,0.0,11501,23891,0.0

tick lag is still horrible for me in my adventure map i saw no improvement whatsoever the only thing that helps is to kill like 100 mobs i ve tried killing all mobs except for villagers  and myself   and it makes barely any difference however  killing all villagers actually helps a lot the problem is that they are very important for my map but since my map is taller than wider  it goes from bedrock to the height limit straight up lol   that probably has a lot do to with it since chunks are 16x16  but 256 tall  the changes to rdxdydz etc will force me to change tons of command blocks r  1 is actually one block now  and not 9 or whatever it was before good change though it makes more sense  also  for some reason an item i have that i ve retextured is showing the old texture  and block model did something change with resource packs  i m happy about the change to the elytra  it seems to work great  edit ok  so i actually tried some of the older versions  15w47c and 15w45a   and there was no difference so clearly my problem is actually caused by the fact that i have 350 entites  including lots of paintings  within only a few chunks  i think 10 actually   and reducing your render distance does help  but it s not exactly fun to have to play at 4 not to mention some of the stuff might not work correctly at that short of a render distance  so what do i do now  maybe i should tp all entites only when someone is close to them but that can become really complicated and i will need tons of command blocks ,d00uwtj,minecraft,gaming,1455558958.0,Hoff123,6.0,0.0,615,160,0.0

i made a version of  midas touch   https  enwikipediaorgwikimidas  without command blocks or mods by exploiting a mechanic of redstone ore  on contact with a player  redstone ore blocks become lit redstone ore blocks i took advantage of that by creating a texture pack and reskinning redstone_ore and lit_redstone ore to be dirt and gold  respectively when the player interacts with the redstone ore  which looks like dirt  it becomes lit redstone ore  which looks like gold   creating the illusion that one is turning dirt to gold the pack also overrides the particles image to remove the redstone dust particles that appear around lit redstone ore blocks  this is obviously just a trick and does nt actually turn dirt to gold you can download the resource pack  here   http  wwwmediafirecomdownloadchr08dumqplueu3midastouchzip   edit  mixed up mods with resource packs,d02bibs,minecraft,gaming,1455654911.0,Bodacious_Potato,3.0,0.0,1028,146,0.0

java 9 is now compatible with minecraft by removing  xx  cmsincrementalmode  from the java arguements  i just installed both and ran minecraft with both they both had equal fps  but java 8 used 10  more ram allocated while java 9 was able to load chunks faster  experimented by tping about 10000 blocks away at the same time on both clients  and seeing which one loaded faster  i ca nt find anything performancewise on the internet about java 9 and minecraft other than that it supports it  java 9 supposedly has java 8 backwards compatibility  meaning mods that require a specific version of java 8 always works on java 9  so mod compatibility is nt an issue  edit  12 hours and all i ve gotten was  how did you get java 9  and  java 8 is more stable because java 9 is nt officially released yet  bandwagon  please  either have experience with java 8 vs java 9 on minecraft or link me to somewhere that has the experience yes  you can download java 9 no  it is not unstable i ve played modpacks of up to 150 mods with java 9  not tested with java 8  and i experience no issues that i could tell  how would you like it if you had a small cough and upset stomach that feels like it s going to explode  and you went to the hospital to get it checked out and all they could tell you was  well i think a small cough means you re just thirsty  or  he does have an upset stomach  maybe he has to shit   i m more than happy to answer any questions you have  but do nt tell me that java 8 is better than java 9 because java 9 is only in early access java 9 works perfectly fine running a modpack for mc 1710 with 150 mods in it  so stability is not an issue here ,461su2,minecraft,gaming,1455616679.0,ShyGlaceon,19.0,0.0,525,4961,0.0

minecraft appears to be a series of cascading overreactions and overlyquick reactions  have furnace minecarts noone uses them  why  because they are such a pain that everyone sticks to minecart boosters so what shall we do  i know  let s remove minecart boosters  oh people are complaining so let s add powered rails oh look  we broke furnace minecarts badly enough that they are nt really usable so let s just get rid of them  you see this with villages  with minecarts  with redstone  with the end and the nether  with potions  with mob farming  both hostile and passive   with ice  with armor  with enchantments  mc used to be a game of alternatives where most things were in fact useful sometimes now  not so much horses obsolesce many things  for instance  makes me want to make a mc no horses  furnace minecarts being the fastest method of travel  faster top speed than powered rails   actually fix the nether floor  ceiling  read  either make the nether 256 blocks high or the world of the nether actually 128 blocks high  and the floorceiling wraps you around if you do somehow manage to get through it  instead of nerfing ender pearls  etc  personally  i think mc should sink some time into figuring out what breaking changes they should do to the game  and do them all at once get them out of the way call  that  the 20 release ,d01y83n,minecraft,gaming,1455636429.0,NotInVan,9.0,0.0,1,855,0.0

note to begin  i just want to stress that is is just  my  opinion on the build if  you  like what you have  then that s all that matters  besides  i guarantee there will be plenty that love this building style that being said  i think it s just a little too messy it is not a sin to have a flat wall  or a patch of the build that s all one color i just think it s a little overdone nowadays the  north facade  picture i think could illustrate my point well ask yourself  what s the focal point of this picture  what is my eye drawn too  for me  again  i want to stress for  me   i do nt really pick out anything special it s just a bunch of colors on the screen  that s really my only criticism the form of the build  as in  the general layout of everything  looks absolutely amazing i just think there s a bit too much detail in parts  not everything has to be made of stairs  p  oh  and by the way  if your are aiming for that highly detailed  often too highly detailed in my opinion  then you again did fantastic the build is very continuous and i think it s clear you picked a style and stuck too it that s a good thing  in summary  if you were aiming for that highly detailed style you definetly nailed it and the form of the build looks great too however  for me personally  that style is just not my cup of tea  nevertheless  great job on simply just following through  i ca nt claim i ve ever really made a  mansion  so that alone is impressive ,d01b3mq,minecraft,gaming,1455583039.0,Ua-Rar,8.0,0.0,1,131,0.0

i was in a mineshaft on a great caving run  i had around 90 diamonds  and out of now where guardians started attacking me  i had mining fatigue 3 for 5 minutesat level 11 why on earth is there range so large that whilst somewhat below a monument  they are able to reach down to level 11 i spawned in some milk so i could actually escape the shaft  i would get hit again before it ran out  and found the temple3040 blocks above me i must have been shot around 10 times before i gave up and cheated my way out what is the actual range  the current range  especially vertically downwards is just plain stupid i understand that its most likely a sphere  but seriously  mining fatigue whilst in a cave  it literally makes those chunks unobtainable ,4646ww,minecraft,gaming,1455651825.0,RavernousPenguin,3.0,0.0,18,118,0.0

i think their range is 50 blocks and those chunks being unobtainable is kind of the point  it gives you incentive to kill them and makes preparing an assault on them  including from below  in caves  much more difficult  sometimes surprise challenges can be the best part of the game  if you allow yourself to see them that way instead of just getting frustrated by the seemingly randomness of it it s not like ocean monuments are common  discovering one while caving is a funny and interesting situation but that s just my two cents ,d02acuh,minecraft,gaming,1455653400.0,Mr_Simba,4.0,0.0,177,8241,0.0

flat is not always bad if you are making smaller builds like houses 1 deep is more than enough i hate when someone builds a 15x10 house and it has like 34 deep walls with over the top details that look worse than better  so if you are building small things  dont try to fit as many details as possible sometimes less is better  try to take a topdown approach and slowly add more and more details  but again be reasonable not every build must be eye catching  also check some google images of builds you want to build ingame wan na do a medieval themed house  google it it will give you an idea how it should look  additionally try to use  realistic  materials dont use wool as the walls or make roofs that look more massive than your main house ,cztfhyi,minecraft,gaming,1455027648.0,_mrx16,8.0,0.0,2090,741,0.0
one note to give people about building is that flat  crap if you want your build to pop out and impress others  make it 2 or even 3 blocks deep this way  you can add extra blocks to the outside  and make it seem more detailed than just a flat wall  another note added to this is the notion  oh  i m terrible at building  so i ll never make anything good to show off  many of the great builders we see referenced today on the server started out with a similar mindset  find your build style maybe you re not a modernistic type builder  but can make building set in the old west very well or maybe you re good at bridges  but ca nt make walls to save your life find the niche that you fit into for your builds  and start expanding your mind on how to make it unique to you  ,cztcdx3,minecraft,gaming,1455019469.0,billyK_,3.0,0.0,18839,122352,0.0
bit of free build advice to people  although a lot of them will know it already   one thing i hear mentioned a lot to people who are just starting to seek build advice is the  do nt make it all one block  thing mojang s villages are a good example of this even without counting doors  windows  stairs  etc most of their village buildings are made of 3 types of blocks  cobblestone  oak planks  oak logs they will often follow a rule of  do nt make the walls and the floor the same material   so you ll get cobble floors with plank walls  or vice versa   or they ll make the bottom block of the wall the same as the floor to simulate wainscottingkickerboards the logs usually show up as support pillars on the corners of the house even if you use different materials the general idea of having support pillars as an excuse for a different block is a good idea  also if you have nt noticed it yet  those stairbased roofs prevent monsters from spawning on them same with slab roofs so long as it s bottomhalf slabs  although villages do nt use slabs only stairs   mind you they did nt have corner stairs when they designed the villages so they used planks instead which can spawn darkness monsters ,czta5lh,minecraft,gaming,1455010105.0,WildBluntHickok,16.0,0.0,3842,19331,0.0

the new spacebar to deploy elytra  in air is an improvement no more crazy camera jitter while wearing it and walking down a mountain or jumping down three blocks you can still speedily descend into your safefall  while wearing elytra now  if you choose could also enable some new pvp escape tactics  perhaps  i ve seen some folks say it would be cool if you could spacebar again to toggle them again to turn them back off this might be cool  but without clear feedback about the deployment state  it might have unintended consequences  eg you jump off a cliff  think you hit space but you still seem to be falling  so you hit space again  but actually you were just lagging and had already deployed the wings  and the second spacebar now turned them back off  depending on how it s implemented so i m not sure about a spacetotoggle mechanic maybe shift  could turn it off again   it might also be useful if there was a thwoomp  soundeffect of the wings catching air to offer audio feedback about the deployment  perhaps ,d00rxcg,minecraft,gaming,1455554552.0,brianmcn,62.0,0.0,11501,23891,0.0

tick lag is still horrible for me in my adventure map i saw no improvement whatsoever the only thing that helps is to kill like 100 mobs i ve tried killing all mobs except for villagers  and myself   and it makes barely any difference however  killing all villagers actually helps a lot the problem is that they are very important for my map but since my map is taller than wider  it goes from bedrock to the height limit straight up lol   that probably has a lot do to with it since chunks are 16x16  but 256 tall  the changes to rdxdydz etc will force me to change tons of command blocks r  1 is actually one block now  and not 9 or whatever it was before good change though it makes more sense  also  for some reason an item i have that i ve retextured is showing the old texture  and block model did something change with resource packs  i m happy about the change to the elytra  it seems to work great  edit ok  so i actually tried some of the older versions  15w47c and 15w45a   and there was no difference so clearly my problem is actually caused by the fact that i have 350 entites  including lots of paintings  within only a few chunks  i think 10 actually   and reducing your render distance does help  but it s not exactly fun to have to play at 4 not to mention some of the stuff might not work correctly at that short of a render distance  so what do i do now  maybe i should tp all entites only when someone is close to them but that can become really complicated and i will need tons of command blocks ,d00uwtj,minecraft,gaming,1455558958.0,Hoff123,6.0,0.0,615,160,0.0

flat is not always bad if you are making smaller builds like houses 1 deep is more than enough i hate when someone builds a 15x10 house and it has like 34 deep walls with over the top details that look worse than better  so if you are building small things  dont try to fit as many details as possible sometimes less is better  try to take a topdown approach and slowly add more and more details  but again be reasonable not every build must be eye catching  also check some google images of builds you want to build ingame wan na do a medieval themed house  google it it will give you an idea how it should look  additionally try to use  realistic  materials dont use wool as the walls or make roofs that look more massive than your main house ,cztfhyi,minecraft,gaming,1455027648.0,_mrx16,8.0,0.0,2090,741,0.0
one note to give people about building is that flat  crap if you want your build to pop out and impress others  make it 2 or even 3 blocks deep this way  you can add extra blocks to the outside  and make it seem more detailed than just a flat wall  another note added to this is the notion  oh  i m terrible at building  so i ll never make anything good to show off  many of the great builders we see referenced today on the server started out with a similar mindset  find your build style maybe you re not a modernistic type builder  but can make building set in the old west very well or maybe you re good at bridges  but ca nt make walls to save your life find the niche that you fit into for your builds  and start expanding your mind on how to make it unique to you  ,cztcdx3,minecraft,gaming,1455019469.0,billyK_,3.0,0.0,18839,122352,0.0
bit of free build advice to people  although a lot of them will know it already   one thing i hear mentioned a lot to people who are just starting to seek build advice is the  do nt make it all one block  thing mojang s villages are a good example of this even without counting doors  windows  stairs  etc most of their village buildings are made of 3 types of blocks  cobblestone  oak planks  oak logs they will often follow a rule of  do nt make the walls and the floor the same material   so you ll get cobble floors with plank walls  or vice versa   or they ll make the bottom block of the wall the same as the floor to simulate wainscottingkickerboards the logs usually show up as support pillars on the corners of the house even if you use different materials the general idea of having support pillars as an excuse for a different block is a good idea  also if you have nt noticed it yet  those stairbased roofs prevent monsters from spawning on them same with slab roofs so long as it s bottomhalf slabs  although villages do nt use slabs only stairs   mind you they did nt have corner stairs when they designed the villages so they used planks instead which can spawn darkness monsters ,czta5lh,minecraft,gaming,1455010105.0,WildBluntHickok,16.0,0.0,3842,19331,0.0

i was in a mineshaft on a great caving run  i had around 90 diamonds  and out of now where guardians started attacking me  i had mining fatigue 3 for 5 minutesat level 11 why on earth is there range so large that whilst somewhat below a monument  they are able to reach down to level 11 i spawned in some milk so i could actually escape the shaft  i would get hit again before it ran out  and found the temple3040 blocks above me i must have been shot around 10 times before i gave up and cheated my way out what is the actual range  the current range  especially vertically downwards is just plain stupid i understand that its most likely a sphere  but seriously  mining fatigue whilst in a cave  it literally makes those chunks unobtainable ,4646ww,minecraft,gaming,1455651825.0,RavernousPenguin,3.0,0.0,18,118,0.0
i think their range is 50 blocks and those chunks being unobtainable is kind of the point  it gives you incentive to kill them and makes preparing an assault on them  including from below  in caves  much more difficult  sometimes surprise challenges can be the best part of the game  if you allow yourself to see them that way instead of just getting frustrated by the seemingly randomness of it it s not like ocean monuments are common  discovering one while caving is a funny and interesting situation but that s just my two cents ,d02acuh,minecraft,gaming,1455653400.0,Mr_Simba,4.0,0.0,177,8241,0.0

aight so a while ago i made a custom pack and i m happy with everything except the particles i was originally going to use faithful particles  but i found some rly nice enchantment runes and potion particles  which were  i guess higher res  because where in the faithful particles  each particle only really is a couple of pixels  my particles were quite detailed and therefore a bigger file the only smoke particles i ve found that i like so far are from faithful  and therefore when i use them they look rly weird  same goes with fire i will try to get a pic to better explain it soon  p any help  internet ,464f71,minecraft,gaming,1455654666.0,toastedhamsters,1.0,0.0,3,6,0.0
i believe that particlespng is just one photo with many different particles in it in this case higher res textured pictures will be naturally bigger in the picture itself in order to customize this you would need a bunch of particles with the same resolution to do this so if you like heart particles from sphax but you like explosions from faithful you would need to download the same resolution folder for each  it usually says it by the download like 32x32 or 128x128 ,d02l49j,minecraft,gaming,1455668707.0,coti5432,1.0,0.0,8,128,0.0

hi all  just downloaded the life in the woods  renaissance pack along with the sildur s vibrant shaders 113 lite my gfx card is kind of a shitter  amd radeon hd 7700   so i m still experiencing low fps even with the lite shader  and i m assuming it s because of the hundred grass blocks waving on my screen at any time i m not sure if the wavy grass is a mod or the shader  but i ve looked through my mod list and not found the answer  and i have no idea how to edit the settings of a shader to disable that feature i ve looked around on the litw  r wiki and not found any answers  as well as trying google if anyone could provide some insight or link to a page that ll show me how to do it  it would be much appreciated  thanks in advance  ps sorry if there s a better place to post this  i did nt see a mod subreddit in the right bar and also did nt see anything about mod questions in the rules ,464vys,minecraft,gaming,1455660459.0,KruSuPhy,0.0,0.0,19,349,0.0

i made a version of  midas touch   https  enwikipediaorgwikimidas  without command blocks or mods by exploiting a mechanic of redstone ore  on contact with a player  redstone ore blocks become lit redstone ore blocks i took advantage of that by creating a texture pack and reskinning redstone_ore and lit_redstone ore to be dirt and gold  respectively when the player interacts with the redstone ore  which looks like dirt  it becomes lit redstone ore  which looks like gold   creating the illusion that one is turning dirt to gold the pack also overrides the particles image to remove the redstone dust particles that appear around lit redstone ore blocks  this is obviously just a trick and does nt actually turn dirt to gold you can download the resource pack  here   http  wwwmediafirecomdownloadchr08dumqplueu3midastouchzip   edit  mixed up mods with resource packs,d02bibs,minecraft,gaming,1455654911.0,Bodacious_Potato,3.0,0.0,1028,146,0.0
