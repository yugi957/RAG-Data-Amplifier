rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers source  my ass,d02qqa6,circlejerk,humor,1455677281,bfjkasds,1,0,1,9523,0.0
it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0224tw,circlejerk,humor,1455642248,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,2,0,23,864,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d02230y,circlejerk,humor,1455642176,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,1,0,23,864,0.0

people who say things like this usually drink exclusively bud light but refuse to try craft beer  and think the epitome of fine dining is a 2 for  20 meal deal at applebee s they ca nt understand why anyone would ever pay more than  3lb at walmart for a steak  and still buy dvds because blurays cost a little bit more and they  do nt really see a difference anyway   they describe anyone who has a nuanced understanding of their hobbies and are willing to pay more to enjoy different facets of those hobbies as  a douchenozzle who smells their own farts out of genuine crystal pinot noir glasses  a red plastic cup works just fine to drink 2buckchuck  and it s easier to chug that way than out of a tiny wine glass  liking simple things and dismissing everything else as elitism is a mindsetway of lifeidentity that a lot of people adopt when they either do nt understand something or ca nt afford nicer things ,d022e6l,circlejerk,humor,1455642618,Shawwnzy,35,0,56,7077,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d01s98r,circlejerk,humor,1455622001,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,13,0,23,864,0.0
the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

what if you had the most talked about highly anticipated album of the year  created one of the most successful shoe lines  plus an admittedly average fashion line   and had to deal with the challenges of marriage  on top of the newly found responsibility of parenthood  consider that pressure  you could argue his money makes it all a little bit better  and the  debt  he has is no where near as serious as the debt of the average college student  but all of that is admittedly a shit tonne of pressure to comprehend for a human being  if i were in that position  i d be fucking terrified fuck  when i perform music live to just 8 people im terrified  yet alone an entire god damn stadium  while he plays the confidence act of overstepping into arrogance far too frequently  you truly have to understand that he is scared  and has his anxieties he s as flawed as anyone i know  but fame shoots his flaws into the public and that s the thing that makes kanye so great  flaws and all  like all of us  he just wants people to understand him while he might say the stupidest shit  have nt we all said some stupid shit  he s basically the living embodiment of the feeling of waking up after a huge night of drinking and regretting everything you ve said and while that s not excusable  it should at least be a lesson to learn from and he does learn lessons  as his songs  if anyone actually stopped to listen to some of his lyrics  show this absurd level of insight heck  look at  runaway  where he says   let s have a toast to the douchbags   in reference to himself heck  he even mentions being on lexapro on one of his newest songs  fml   of course he s scared however  an acknowledgment of guilt is not an omission of guilt  but his personality in conjunction with his art stands to force us all to stop and think  whether it be positively or negatively  undeniably  he s had a tremendous impact on our culture  and that s immediately evident in the huge amount of both love and hatred thrown towards him and  at the end of the day  is nt that the entire point of being an artist  to put forth your most honest and personal expressions to the world in order to evoke thought and criticisms about the way in which our lives operate  i was at a party where someone once told me that they hated kanye west  and after hearing his answer which was quite basic  revolving around his marriage to kim  and his asshole reaction to taylor swift  i asked him to name me all of kanye s albums  to which he could nt name more than one it made realise something really important about human beings  we default to hating something when we truly do nt understand something and this terrifies me because it made me wonder that  if this man hated something simply because he did nt understand his own emotions  then one day he might love something or someone without understanding why and  i d hate to be his wife when he one day makes that realisation  it s so easy to just say we hate something when we do nt understand it we should be saying   i do nt know   i do nt know  is perhaps the most powerful thing a human being can say  because when you utter those words  it shows that you re willing to learn you re willing to try but people do nt want to admit that they do nt understand certain things  because to do that  would be to show a sign if weakness  a lack of intelligence we re scared we will be judged  and seen as stupid what s even sadder is that this line of thinking is applied to things such as politics as well  which is a frightening thought when you realise that this fear driven ignorance is influencing the way in which our countries operate and it s fine to hate things  but i simply feel that we as humans are far too busy to take stock of our own beliefs sometimes we can be complacent individuals who fall into bad habits out of sheer comfort if you want to hate something  and remember that hate is an incredibly forceful word  stop to consider the true reasons as to why you hate that thing  and ask yourself whether those are entirely valid reasons if so  feel free  but be prepared to fight for that argument until the death with a healthy combination of flawless logic and impassioned conviction  and i guess that s why i respect kanye west  he s fearless to be true to himself  and to fail repeatedly despite the consequences if i could be as fearless as kanye west  then who knows what the hell i could accomplish but like most people  i m selfishly hung up on my own insecurities and fears  which is leading me to live a life that does nt feel like its been lived on my terms i would undeniably fail  and i would fail gloriously to my friends  family and peers but  at the same time  at least it would simultaneously allow me the opportunity to perhaps succeed  tl  dr  understand why you hate something  and be fearless in your pursuit to be great ,d02gj6h,circlejerk,humor,1455661663,AgentDaleKooper,-1,0,26,8017,1.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0224tw,circlejerk,humor,1455642248,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,2,0,23,864,0.0

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers source  my ass,d02qqa6,circlejerk,humor,1455677281,bfjkasds,1,0,1,9523,0.0

harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue

are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there

such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a

the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

people who say things like this usually drink exclusively bud light but refuse to try craft beer  and think the epitome of fine dining is a 2 for  20 meal deal at applebee s they ca nt understand why anyone would ever pay more than  3lb at walmart for a steak  and still buy dvds because blurays cost a little bit more and they  do nt really see a difference anyway   they describe anyone who has a nuanced understanding of their hobbies and are willing to pay more to enjoy different facets of those hobbies as  a douchenozzle who smells their own farts out of genuine crystal pinot noir glasses  a red plastic cup works just fine to drink 2buckchuck  and it s easier to chug that way than out of a tiny wine glass  liking simple things and dismissing everything else as elitism is a mindsetway of lifeidentity that a lot of people adopt when they either do nt understand something or ca nt afford nicer things ,d022e6l,circlejerk,humor,1455642618,Shawwnzy,35,0,56,7077,0.0

what if you had the most talked about highly anticipated album of the year  created one of the most successful shoe lines  plus an admittedly average fashion line   and had to deal with the challenges of marriage  on top of the newly found responsibility of parenthood  consider that pressure  you could argue his money makes it all a little bit better  and the  debt  he has is no where near as serious as the debt of the average college student  but all of that is admittedly a shit tonne of pressure to comprehend for a human being  if i were in that position  i d be fucking terrified fuck  when i perform music live to just 8 people im terrified  yet alone an entire god damn stadium  while he plays the confidence act of overstepping into arrogance far too frequently  you truly have to understand that he is scared  and has his anxieties he s as flawed as anyone i know  but fame shoots his flaws into the public and that s the thing that makes kanye so great  flaws and all  like all of us  he just wants people to understand him while he might say the stupidest shit  have nt we all said some stupid shit  he s basically the living embodiment of the feeling of waking up after a huge night of drinking and regretting everything you ve said and while that s not excusable  it should at least be a lesson to learn from and he does learn lessons  as his songs  if anyone actually stopped to listen to some of his lyrics  show this absurd level of insight heck  look at  runaway  where he says   let s have a toast to the douchbags   in reference to himself heck  he even mentions being on lexapro on one of his newest songs  fml   of course he s scared however  an acknowledgment of guilt is not an omission of guilt  but his personality in conjunction with his art stands to force us all to stop and think  whether it be positively or negatively  undeniably  he s had a tremendous impact on our culture  and that s immediately evident in the huge amount of both love and hatred thrown towards him and  at the end of the day  is nt that the entire point of being an artist  to put forth your most honest and personal expressions to the world in order to evoke thought and criticisms about the way in which our lives operate  i was at a party where someone once told me that they hated kanye west  and after hearing his answer which was quite basic  revolving around his marriage to kim  and his asshole reaction to taylor swift  i asked him to name me all of kanye s albums  to which he could nt name more than one it made realise something really important about human beings  we default to hating something when we truly do nt understand something and this terrifies me because it made me wonder that  if this man hated something simply because he did nt understand his own emotions  then one day he might love something or someone without understanding why and  i d hate to be his wife when he one day makes that realisation  it s so easy to just say we hate something when we do nt understand it we should be saying   i do nt know   i do nt know  is perhaps the most powerful thing a human being can say  because when you utter those words  it shows that you re willing to learn you re willing to try but people do nt want to admit that they do nt understand certain things  because to do that  would be to show a sign if weakness  a lack of intelligence we re scared we will be judged  and seen as stupid what s even sadder is that this line of thinking is applied to things such as politics as well  which is a frightening thought when you realise that this fear driven ignorance is influencing the way in which our countries operate and it s fine to hate things  but i simply feel that we as humans are far too busy to take stock of our own beliefs sometimes we can be complacent individuals who fall into bad habits out of sheer comfort if you want to hate something  and remember that hate is an incredibly forceful word  stop to consider the true reasons as to why you hate that thing  and ask yourself whether those are entirely valid reasons if so  feel free  but be prepared to fight for that argument until the death with a healthy combination of flawless logic and impassioned conviction  and i guess that s why i respect kanye west  he s fearless to be true to himself  and to fail repeatedly despite the consequences if i could be as fearless as kanye west  then who knows what the hell i could accomplish but like most people  i m selfishly hung up on my own insecurities and fears  which is leading me to live a life that does nt feel like its been lived on my terms i would undeniably fail  and i would fail gloriously to my friends  family and peers but  at the same time  at least it would simultaneously allow me the opportunity to perhaps succeed  tl  dr  understand why you hate something  and be fearless in your pursuit to be great ,d02gj6h,circlejerk,humor,1455661663,AgentDaleKooper,-1,0,26,8017,1.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  ryan if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d02qpf8,circlejerk,humor,1455677246,bfjkasds,2,0,1,9523,0.0

person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d01pva3,circlejerk,humor,1455612299,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,7,0,23,864,0.0

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit  they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers  source  my ass,d028238,circlejerk,humor,1455650330,coolanybody,2,0,1471,2719,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0225u8,circlejerk,humor,1455642287,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,1,0,23,864,0.0

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit  they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers  source  my ass,d028238,circlejerk,humor,1455650330,coolanybody,2,0,1471,2719,0.0

you want to know what really creeps me out about umbridge  it s confirmed that she is able to cast the patronus charm  a fully corporeal persian cat  why is this creepy  because in the hp universe  it is established that the truly evil are unable to cast this protective charm it is already considered incredibly difficult  with the vast majority of adult witches and wizards unable to cast it purely due to its complexity  but the truly evil would literally be eaten by maggots spilling from their wands if they attempted it that s why you do nt see voldemort and the death eaters  with the exception of snape  casting it  and why azkaban  guarded by dementors  is such an effective and inescapable punishment for the truly wicked  now  you re going to think that my argument here is the usual  she s bureaucratic  realistic evil and therefore human enough to still have a good side and happy memories   but in fact the story gets worse  umbridge produced the patronus because she was wearing slytherin s locket  one of voldemort s horcruxes  and was able to feed off it that s right  this lady was so evil that the soulinfused artifact of evil gave her enough strength to produce something voldemort himself was nt even capable of  now that s some serious fucking evil ,d00t130,circlejerk,humor,1455556212,itsthehumidity,57,0,11525,9964,0.0

you want to know what really creeps me out about umbridge  it s confirmed that she is able to cast the patronus charm  a fully corporeal persian cat  why is this creepy  because in the hp universe  it is established that the truly evil are unable to cast this protective charm it is already considered incredibly difficult  with the vast majority of adult witches and wizards unable to cast it purely due to its complexity  but the truly evil would literally be eaten by maggots spilling from their wands if they attempted it that s why you do nt see voldemort and the death eaters  with the exception of snape  casting it  and why azkaban  guarded by dementors  is such an effective and inescapable punishment for the truly wicked  now  you re going to think that my argument here is the usual  she s bureaucratic  realistic evil and therefore human enough to still have a good side and happy memories   but in fact the story gets worse  umbridge produced the patronus because she was wearing slytherin s locket  one of voldemort s horcruxes  and was able to feed off it that s right  this lady was so evil that the soulinfused artifact of evil gave her enough strength to produce something voldemort himself was nt even capable of  now that s some serious fucking evil ,d00t130,circlejerk,humor,1455556212,itsthehumidity,57,0,11525,9964,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d022814,circlejerk,humor,1455642375,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,0,0,23,864,0.0
bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first ,d01yb8g,circlejerk,humor,1455636571,TheNazruddin,1,0,1,521,0.0

honestly  i m a grandpa and i still do nt mind bernie sanders but that s because i see hillary clinton as irritating i m old enough to remember what bernie sanders was doing before dank memes  with american idol and thx 420blazeit and how he lucked out with dank memes and has never looked back i remember how derivative and hot guy fieri is i never saw it as anything but crashboom up on the meme  something to jerk off to and quote the occasional cheesy meme line i saw the star wars hillary special firstrun on tv  it s the people who got blinded early  who saw sanders  work as genius in the first place  who had room for dank memes to titillate them those of us who know the difference between presidential fiction and a shootemup circlejerk in space were never disappointed  because we always saw the series for the flavortown it was  sure  hillary clinton s irritating  so is donald trump  ben carson  ted cruz  marco rubio and his  gee whiz let s dispel once and for all this fiction  act  the eccentric meme wipes  the utterly nondank pepes  the  jet fuel can melt steel beams  bullshit  the meme love story lines  and most especially the asspull dankism that sanders has disappeared up his own asshole with for the past 69 decades now  you re all welcome to get your deep life truths from hillary clinton if you want i already sat through that shit in obama s campaign  and  diners  driveins  and dives   so everything bernie could ever show me was already dank memes and stock fieris before sanders ever picked up his maymays  sure  hitlery clinton is entertaining it s entertaining as a guilty pleasure only  a greasy burger basket full of comcast employees and nazis and hokey fine bros hillary clinton is nothing but one more burger coming down the conveyor belt of the literallyhitler factory you re fucking dead  kiddo ,d01nu7i,circlejerk,humor,1455605766,hobodude34,7,0,863,3215,0.0
here in my garage  just bought this new top sniper in the entire us armed forces here it  s fun to kill you in over seven hundred ways up here in the hollywood hills but you know what i like more than the navy seals  gorilla warfare in fact  i  m a lot more proud of these numerous secret raids on alquaeda that i had to get installed to hold over 300 confirmed kills that i bought it  s like the top sniper warren buffett says   the more you prepare for the storm  the more you drown in it  now maybe you  ve seen my secret raid on alquaeda where i talk about how i wipe out a target a day you know  i wipe out a target a day not to show off it  s again about the unholy retribution in fact  the real reason i keep this top sniper here is that it  s a reminder a reminder that you are nothing to me but just another target  because it wasn  t that long ago that i was a goddamn idiot sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven confirmed kills in my network of spies i didn  t have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  i had no opportunities  but you know what  something happened that changed my life i bumped into a confirmed kill and another confirmed kill and a few more confirmed kills i found five confirmed kills again  it  s not just about money  it  s about the good life  gorilla warfare  the navy seals  unarmed combat and confirmed kills and so i record a little secret raid  it  s actually on my website  you can click here on this video and it  ll take you to my website where i share three ways to kill with my bare hands that they taught me three combat tactics that you can implement today no matter where you are  kiddo  now  this isn  t a  get confirmed kills quick  scheme you know  like they say if kills sound too good to be true they are too good to be confirmed i  m not promising you that tomorrow you  re gon na be able to become the top sniper in the entire us armed forces but what i am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven tactics so  i record a little two minute secret raid on my website like i said  now it  s not the most professional i just shot it here with my entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  but it  s real nobody can argue  this is my conformed kill and i  m going to give you the three most important kills you can do today so click the link  go there it  s completely free to watch it it  s just a couple minutes invest in your kills always be curious don  t be a maggot okay  people see videos like this and they say  ah that  s not real that  s for somebody else  don  t listen  don  t listen be an optimist like  conrad hilton  the top sniper who started hilton hotel  he said that he was only fifteen years old when he got his first confirmed kill  and that changed his life confirmed kills can change your life and in that secret raid  helen keller said  shit fury  so if you  re a maggot  if you  re a little shit you don  t need to click here don  t worry about it  i don  t need to talk to maggots but if you  re somebody who knows gorilla warfare  cause the kills are possible  you know  for some of you watching it  s not necessarily a top sniper  maybe it  s a secret raid on alquaeda  a new confirmed kill  starting your own network of spies  maybe it  s a new lifestyle without so much stress  graduating top of your class in the navy seals  doing those things you know you  re destined to do you ca nt do those unless you understand gorilla warfare money  i don  t call it money anymore  i call it confirmed kills you must have enough kills to live out your dream and to live out your destiny so  i  ll see you on my website  it  s a quick video and you  ll see there absolutely free  so just click this video and you  ll be taken there in a second  and uh  i  m excited to share these combat tactics you  ll see  not because of anything of me but because i  ve been fortunate enough to learn from snipers many years ahead of me not just in secret raids on alquaeda like these  although i love confirmed kills but also real inperson top snipers so let me share with you these three combat tactics that have made all the difference in my life they  re practical  you can do them today  you can start on them today all right  see you there on my site ,d01bqej,circlejerk,humor,1455584075,Is_A_Velociraptor,93,0,5635,69860,0.0
ah  shrek the best  fuck you  anyone has ever told mostly due to the dick jokes let me explain  a while ago before the movie came out the creator of shrek and another guy were pixar executives and when their creator died in a helicopter crash  the creator of shrek thought he d be the replacement and get the promotion but the other executive thought he should have the top spot and a feud began after a bunch of lawsuits and claims of holding out on pay and lawyer shit the cretor of shrek to go create dreamworks  after some semisuccesful movies he decided to make shrek  which was created just to  literally  shit on everything disney here s where the fun begins  shrek starts off with him reading a  typical fairy tale  of the knight in shining armour saving the princess bla bla bla  and then shrek rips out a page and uses it to  presumably since he s in an outhouse  wipe his ass with it  then of course there are all the public domain fairy tales that disney was famous for in the movie having them sent off to live in a swamp  possibly because those were the old fairy tales that no one cared about anymore   then the rest of movie is the creator saying disney is stupid he does nt have a typical handsome knight  it s the opposite with an ugly ogre asshole  and he does nt have a steed he has  literally  an ass so he goes on a journey to save a princess  but not exactly    at first  he does nt know about a princess nor does he give a shit about her once he does find out he s just a guy who wants his swamp back so when they arrive at lord farquad s castle  here is the first dick joke there is a large tower and shrek makes a remark saying  maybe he s overcompensating  and laughs to himself which for a kid might mean his height  but it could mean his penis size as well  i will come back to that later    then when they do set off on their journey his steed is a scared motherfucker and they meet a dragon who is not evil  but instead a woman and falls in love with donkey  once they are bringing princess fiona back along the way we see that fiona is actually as dirty and as disgusting as shrek  not the  fair lady  she s expected to be   also  on the way when donkey is explaining what lord farquad looks like he says  something along the lines of    and he s got a really big tower  which shrek says he s overcompensating because he has a really  and shrek hits him to shut him up presumably he was going to say  a really small penis  because that would seem to make sense after that line  and  there s one point as you ll see here where lord farquad is asking his mirror to show him princess fiona and he takes a peek under the covers possibly looking at his raging boner  then there s the ending with the true love first kiss will reverse princess fiona s curse well it turns out here that she ends up loving shrek  the ugly orger and not a handsome prince  and instead turns into an ugly lady herself reverse beauty and the beast in a way  then there s finally the name lord farquaad it s been rumoured they did this to get away with naming him a  fuckwad  and getting away with it in a kids movie  it seems like they really hated lord farquaad to say he has a small penis  make him incredibly short  and call him a fuckwad well the man from earlier that the creator of shrek hated  was the inspiration for this dick of a character in court the creator of shrek supposedly called him a  psycho midget   something like that   tl  dr a feud with the creator of shrek and another guy at disney made him make a movie about taking a shit on everything disney give it another watch and you might also see some dick jokes  edit  sure i could ve edited this quite a bit but honestly i am just too lazy also yes  i copy and pasted my own comment from a while back and decided to whore it out again for some karma for those saying  those jokes were obvious bla bla bla  some of us were young enough to not understand the jokes the first time around i figured this was interesting and for those who thanked me  you re welcome stay fresh  say no to drugs  and do nt eat yellow snow ,d01h8ap,circlejerk,humor,1455592707,a-person-on-reddit,25,0,3214,188,0.0

bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first ,d01yb8g,circlejerk,humor,1455636571,TheNazruddin,1,0,1,521,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0222if,circlejerk,humor,1455642155,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,3,0,23,864,0.0

a liberal muslim homosexual aclu lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on karl marx  known atheist  before the class begins  you must get on your knees and worship marx and accept that he was the most highlyevolved being the world has ever known  even greater than jesus christ   at this moment  a brave  patriotic  prolife navy seal champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the united states stood up and held up a rock   how old is this rock  pinhead   the arrogant professor smirked quite jewishly and smugly replied  46 billion years  you stupid christian   wrong it  s been 5000 years since god created it if it was 46 billion years old and evolution  as you say  is real  then it should be an animal now  the professor was visibly shaken  and dropped his chalk and copy of origin of the species he stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears the same tears liberals cry for the  poor   who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators  when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators there is no doubt that at this point our professor  deshawn washington  wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor he wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment  but he himself had petitioned against them  the students applauded and all registered republican that day and accepted jesus as their lord and savior an eagle named  small government  flew into the room and perched atop the american flag and shed a tear on the chalk the pledge of allegiance was read several times  and god himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country  the professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day he died of the gay plague aids and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity ,d02h9x9,circlejerk,humor,1455662731,s7en,10,0,2134,45,0.0

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  bernie if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d01rghx,circlejerk,humor,1455618726,PigHaggerty,2,0,1836,11828,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0225u8,circlejerk,humor,1455642287,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,1,0,23,864,0.0

here in my garage  just bought this new top sniper in the entire us armed forces here it  s fun to kill you in over seven hundred ways up here in the hollywood hills but you know what i like more than the navy seals  gorilla warfare in fact  i  m a lot more proud of these numerous secret raids on alquaeda that i had to get installed to hold over 300 confirmed kills that i bought it  s like the top sniper warren buffett says   the more you prepare for the storm  the more you drown in it  now maybe you  ve seen my secret raid on alquaeda where i talk about how i wipe out a target a day you know  i wipe out a target a day not to show off it  s again about the unholy retribution in fact  the real reason i keep this top sniper here is that it  s a reminder a reminder that you are nothing to me but just another target  because it wasn  t that long ago that i was a goddamn idiot sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven confirmed kills in my network of spies i didn  t have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  i had no opportunities  but you know what  something happened that changed my life i bumped into a confirmed kill and another confirmed kill and a few more confirmed kills i found five confirmed kills again  it  s not just about money  it  s about the good life  gorilla warfare  the navy seals  unarmed combat and confirmed kills and so i record a little secret raid  it  s actually on my website  you can click here on this video and it  ll take you to my website where i share three ways to kill with my bare hands that they taught me three combat tactics that you can implement today no matter where you are  kiddo  now  this isn  t a  get confirmed kills quick  scheme you know  like they say if kills sound too good to be true they are too good to be confirmed i  m not promising you that tomorrow you  re gon na be able to become the top sniper in the entire us armed forces but what i am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven tactics so  i record a little two minute secret raid on my website like i said  now it  s not the most professional i just shot it here with my entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  but it  s real nobody can argue  this is my conformed kill and i  m going to give you the three most important kills you can do today so click the link  go there it  s completely free to watch it it  s just a couple minutes invest in your kills always be curious don  t be a maggot okay  people see videos like this and they say  ah that  s not real that  s for somebody else  don  t listen  don  t listen be an optimist like  conrad hilton  the top sniper who started hilton hotel  he said that he was only fifteen years old when he got his first confirmed kill  and that changed his life confirmed kills can change your life and in that secret raid  helen keller said  shit fury  so if you  re a maggot  if you  re a little shit you don  t need to click here don  t worry about it  i don  t need to talk to maggots but if you  re somebody who knows gorilla warfare  cause the kills are possible  you know  for some of you watching it  s not necessarily a top sniper  maybe it  s a secret raid on alquaeda  a new confirmed kill  starting your own network of spies  maybe it  s a new lifestyle without so much stress  graduating top of your class in the navy seals  doing those things you know you  re destined to do you ca nt do those unless you understand gorilla warfare money  i don  t call it money anymore  i call it confirmed kills you must have enough kills to live out your dream and to live out your destiny so  i  ll see you on my website  it  s a quick video and you  ll see there absolutely free  so just click this video and you  ll be taken there in a second  and uh  i  m excited to share these combat tactics you  ll see  not because of anything of me but because i  ve been fortunate enough to learn from snipers many years ahead of me not just in secret raids on alquaeda like these  although i love confirmed kills but also real inperson top snipers so let me share with you these three combat tactics that have made all the difference in my life they  re practical  you can do them today  you can start on them today all right  see you there on my site ,d01bqej,circlejerk,humor,1455584075,Is_A_Velociraptor,93,0,5635,69860,0.0

ah  shrek the best  fuck you  anyone has ever told mostly due to the dick jokes let me explain  a while ago before the movie came out the creator of shrek and another guy were pixar executives and when their creator died in a helicopter crash  the creator of shrek thought he d be the replacement and get the promotion but the other executive thought he should have the top spot and a feud began after a bunch of lawsuits and claims of holding out on pay and lawyer shit the cretor of shrek to go create dreamworks  after some semisuccesful movies he decided to make shrek  which was created just to  literally  shit on everything disney here s where the fun begins  shrek starts off with him reading a  typical fairy tale  of the knight in shining armour saving the princess bla bla bla  and then shrek rips out a page and uses it to  presumably since he s in an outhouse  wipe his ass with it  then of course there are all the public domain fairy tales that disney was famous for in the movie having them sent off to live in a swamp  possibly because those were the old fairy tales that no one cared about anymore   then the rest of movie is the creator saying disney is stupid he does nt have a typical handsome knight  it s the opposite with an ugly ogre asshole  and he does nt have a steed he has  literally  an ass so he goes on a journey to save a princess  but not exactly    at first  he does nt know about a princess nor does he give a shit about her once he does find out he s just a guy who wants his swamp back so when they arrive at lord farquad s castle  here is the first dick joke there is a large tower and shrek makes a remark saying  maybe he s overcompensating  and laughs to himself which for a kid might mean his height  but it could mean his penis size as well  i will come back to that later    then when they do set off on their journey his steed is a scared motherfucker and they meet a dragon who is not evil  but instead a woman and falls in love with donkey  once they are bringing princess fiona back along the way we see that fiona is actually as dirty and as disgusting as shrek  not the  fair lady  she s expected to be   also  on the way when donkey is explaining what lord farquad looks like he says  something along the lines of    and he s got a really big tower  which shrek says he s overcompensating because he has a really  and shrek hits him to shut him up presumably he was going to say  a really small penis  because that would seem to make sense after that line  and  there s one point as you ll see here where lord farquad is asking his mirror to show him princess fiona and he takes a peek under the covers possibly looking at his raging boner  then there s the ending with the true love first kiss will reverse princess fiona s curse well it turns out here that she ends up loving shrek  the ugly orger and not a handsome prince  and instead turns into an ugly lady herself reverse beauty and the beast in a way  then there s finally the name lord farquaad it s been rumoured they did this to get away with naming him a  fuckwad  and getting away with it in a kids movie  it seems like they really hated lord farquaad to say he has a small penis  make him incredibly short  and call him a fuckwad well the man from earlier that the creator of shrek hated  was the inspiration for this dick of a character in court the creator of shrek supposedly called him a  psycho midget   something like that   tl  dr a feud with the creator of shrek and another guy at disney made him make a movie about taking a shit on everything disney give it another watch and you might also see some dick jokes  edit  sure i could ve edited this quite a bit but honestly i am just too lazy also yes  i copy and pasted my own comment from a while back and decided to whore it out again for some karma for those saying  those jokes were obvious bla bla bla  some of us were young enough to not understand the jokes the first time around i figured this was interesting and for those who thanked me  you re welcome stay fresh  say no to drugs  and do nt eat yellow snow ,d01h8ap,circlejerk,humor,1455592707,a-person-on-reddit,25,0,3214,188,0.0

here in my garage  just bought this new top sniper in the entire us armed forces here it  s fun to kill you in over seven hundred ways up here in the hollywood hills but you know what i like more than the navy seals  gorilla warfare in fact  i  m a lot more proud of these numerous secret raids on alquaeda that i had to get installed to hold over 300 confirmed kills that i bought it  s like the top sniper warren buffett says   the more you prepare for the storm  the more you drown in it  now maybe you  ve seen my secret raid on alquaeda where i talk about how i wipe out a target a day you know  i wipe out a target a day not to show off it  s again about the unholy retribution in fact  the real reason i keep this top sniper here is that it  s a reminder a reminder that you are nothing to me but just another target  because it wasn  t that long ago that i was a goddamn idiot sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven confirmed kills in my network of spies i didn  t have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  i had no opportunities  but you know what  something happened that changed my life i bumped into a confirmed kill and another confirmed kill and a few more confirmed kills i found five confirmed kills again  it  s not just about money  it  s about the good life  gorilla warfare  the navy seals  unarmed combat and confirmed kills and so i record a little secret raid  it  s actually on my website  you can click here on this video and it  ll take you to my website where i share three ways to kill with my bare hands that they taught me three combat tactics that you can implement today no matter where you are  kiddo  now  this isn  t a  get confirmed kills quick  scheme you know  like they say if kills sound too good to be true they are too good to be confirmed i  m not promising you that tomorrow you  re gon na be able to become the top sniper in the entire us armed forces but what i am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven tactics so  i record a little two minute secret raid on my website like i said  now it  s not the most professional i just shot it here with my entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  but it  s real nobody can argue  this is my conformed kill and i  m going to give you the three most important kills you can do today so click the link  go there it  s completely free to watch it it  s just a couple minutes invest in your kills always be curious don  t be a maggot okay  people see videos like this and they say  ah that  s not real that  s for somebody else  don  t listen  don  t listen be an optimist like  conrad hilton  the top sniper who started hilton hotel  he said that he was only fifteen years old when he got his first confirmed kill  and that changed his life confirmed kills can change your life and in that secret raid  helen keller said  shit fury  so if you  re a maggot  if you  re a little shit you don  t need to click here don  t worry about it  i don  t need to talk to maggots but if you  re somebody who knows gorilla warfare  cause the kills are possible  you know  for some of you watching it  s not necessarily a top sniper  maybe it  s a secret raid on alquaeda  a new confirmed kill  starting your own network of spies  maybe it  s a new lifestyle without so much stress  graduating top of your class in the navy seals  doing those things you know you  re destined to do you ca nt do those unless you understand gorilla warfare money  i don  t call it money anymore  i call it confirmed kills you must have enough kills to live out your dream and to live out your destiny so  i  ll see you on my website  it  s a quick video and you  ll see there absolutely free  so just click this video and you  ll be taken there in a second  and uh  i  m excited to share these combat tactics you  ll see  not because of anything of me but because i  ve been fortunate enough to learn from snipers many years ahead of me not just in secret raids on alquaeda like these  although i love confirmed kills but also real inperson top snipers so let me share with you these three combat tactics that have made all the difference in my life they  re practical  you can do them today  you can start on them today all right  see you there on my site ,d01bqej,circlejerk,humor,1455584075,Is_A_Velociraptor,93,0,5635,69860,0.0

ah  shrek the best  fuck you  anyone has ever told mostly due to the dick jokes let me explain  a while ago before the movie came out the creator of shrek and another guy were pixar executives and when their creator died in a helicopter crash  the creator of shrek thought he d be the replacement and get the promotion but the other executive thought he should have the top spot and a feud began after a bunch of lawsuits and claims of holding out on pay and lawyer shit the cretor of shrek to go create dreamworks  after some semisuccesful movies he decided to make shrek  which was created just to  literally  shit on everything disney here s where the fun begins  shrek starts off with him reading a  typical fairy tale  of the knight in shining armour saving the princess bla bla bla  and then shrek rips out a page and uses it to  presumably since he s in an outhouse  wipe his ass with it  then of course there are all the public domain fairy tales that disney was famous for in the movie having them sent off to live in a swamp  possibly because those were the old fairy tales that no one cared about anymore   then the rest of movie is the creator saying disney is stupid he does nt have a typical handsome knight  it s the opposite with an ugly ogre asshole  and he does nt have a steed he has  literally  an ass so he goes on a journey to save a princess  but not exactly    at first  he does nt know about a princess nor does he give a shit about her once he does find out he s just a guy who wants his swamp back so when they arrive at lord farquad s castle  here is the first dick joke there is a large tower and shrek makes a remark saying  maybe he s overcompensating  and laughs to himself which for a kid might mean his height  but it could mean his penis size as well  i will come back to that later    then when they do set off on their journey his steed is a scared motherfucker and they meet a dragon who is not evil  but instead a woman and falls in love with donkey  once they are bringing princess fiona back along the way we see that fiona is actually as dirty and as disgusting as shrek  not the  fair lady  she s expected to be   also  on the way when donkey is explaining what lord farquad looks like he says  something along the lines of    and he s got a really big tower  which shrek says he s overcompensating because he has a really  and shrek hits him to shut him up presumably he was going to say  a really small penis  because that would seem to make sense after that line  and  there s one point as you ll see here where lord farquad is asking his mirror to show him princess fiona and he takes a peek under the covers possibly looking at his raging boner  then there s the ending with the true love first kiss will reverse princess fiona s curse well it turns out here that she ends up loving shrek  the ugly orger and not a handsome prince  and instead turns into an ugly lady herself reverse beauty and the beast in a way  then there s finally the name lord farquaad it s been rumoured they did this to get away with naming him a  fuckwad  and getting away with it in a kids movie  it seems like they really hated lord farquaad to say he has a small penis  make him incredibly short  and call him a fuckwad well the man from earlier that the creator of shrek hated  was the inspiration for this dick of a character in court the creator of shrek supposedly called him a  psycho midget   something like that   tl  dr a feud with the creator of shrek and another guy at disney made him make a movie about taking a shit on everything disney give it another watch and you might also see some dick jokes  edit  sure i could ve edited this quite a bit but honestly i am just too lazy also yes  i copy and pasted my own comment from a while back and decided to whore it out again for some karma for those saying  those jokes were obvious bla bla bla  some of us were young enough to not understand the jokes the first time around i figured this was interesting and for those who thanked me  you re welcome stay fresh  say no to drugs  and do nt eat yellow snow ,d01h8ap,circlejerk,humor,1455592707,a-person-on-reddit,25,0,3214,188,0.0

honestly  i m a grandpa and i still do nt mind bernie sanders but that s because i see hillary clinton as irritating i m old enough to remember what bernie sanders was doing before dank memes  with american idol and thx 420blazeit and how he lucked out with dank memes and has never looked back i remember how derivative and hot guy fieri is i never saw it as anything but crashboom up on the meme  something to jerk off to and quote the occasional cheesy meme line i saw the star wars hillary special firstrun on tv  it s the people who got blinded early  who saw sanders  work as genius in the first place  who had room for dank memes to titillate them those of us who know the difference between presidential fiction and a shootemup circlejerk in space were never disappointed  because we always saw the series for the flavortown it was  sure  hillary clinton s irritating  so is donald trump  ben carson  ted cruz  marco rubio and his  gee whiz let s dispel once and for all this fiction  act  the eccentric meme wipes  the utterly nondank pepes  the  jet fuel can melt steel beams  bullshit  the meme love story lines  and most especially the asspull dankism that sanders has disappeared up his own asshole with for the past 69 decades now  you re all welcome to get your deep life truths from hillary clinton if you want i already sat through that shit in obama s campaign  and  diners  driveins  and dives   so everything bernie could ever show me was already dank memes and stock fieris before sanders ever picked up his maymays  sure  hitlery clinton is entertaining it s entertaining as a guilty pleasure only  a greasy burger basket full of comcast employees and nazis and hokey fine bros hillary clinton is nothing but one more burger coming down the conveyor belt of the literallyhitler factory you re fucking dead  kiddo ,d01nu7i,circlejerk,humor,1455605766,hobodude34,7,0,863,3215,0.0

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers source  my ass,d02qq2f,circlejerk,humor,1455677272,bfjkasds,1,0,1,9523,0.0

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  ryan if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d02qpf8,circlejerk,humor,1455677246,bfjkasds,2,0,1,9523,0.0

people who say things like this usually drink exclusively bud light but refuse to try craft beer  and think the epitome of fine dining is a 2 for  20 meal deal at applebee s they ca nt understand why anyone would ever pay more than  3lb at walmart for a steak  and still buy dvds because blurays cost a little bit more and they  do nt really see a difference anyway   they describe anyone who has a nuanced understanding of their hobbies and are willing to pay more to enjoy different facets of those hobbies as  a douchenozzle who smells their own farts out of genuine crystal pinot noir glasses  a red plastic cup works just fine to drink 2buckchuck  and it s easier to chug that way than out of a tiny wine glass  liking simple things and dismissing everything else as elitism is a mindsetway of lifeidentity that a lot of people adopt when they either do nt understand something or ca nt afford nicer things ,d022e6l,circlejerk,humor,1455642618,Shawwnzy,35,0,56,7077,0.0

what if you had the most talked about highly anticipated album of the year  created one of the most successful shoe lines  plus an admittedly average fashion line   and had to deal with the challenges of marriage  on top of the newly found responsibility of parenthood  consider that pressure  you could argue his money makes it all a little bit better  and the  debt  he has is no where near as serious as the debt of the average college student  but all of that is admittedly a shit tonne of pressure to comprehend for a human being  if i were in that position  i d be fucking terrified fuck  when i perform music live to just 8 people im terrified  yet alone an entire god damn stadium  while he plays the confidence act of overstepping into arrogance far too frequently  you truly have to understand that he is scared  and has his anxieties he s as flawed as anyone i know  but fame shoots his flaws into the public and that s the thing that makes kanye so great  flaws and all  like all of us  he just wants people to understand him while he might say the stupidest shit  have nt we all said some stupid shit  he s basically the living embodiment of the feeling of waking up after a huge night of drinking and regretting everything you ve said and while that s not excusable  it should at least be a lesson to learn from and he does learn lessons  as his songs  if anyone actually stopped to listen to some of his lyrics  show this absurd level of insight heck  look at  runaway  where he says   let s have a toast to the douchbags   in reference to himself heck  he even mentions being on lexapro on one of his newest songs  fml   of course he s scared however  an acknowledgment of guilt is not an omission of guilt  but his personality in conjunction with his art stands to force us all to stop and think  whether it be positively or negatively  undeniably  he s had a tremendous impact on our culture  and that s immediately evident in the huge amount of both love and hatred thrown towards him and  at the end of the day  is nt that the entire point of being an artist  to put forth your most honest and personal expressions to the world in order to evoke thought and criticisms about the way in which our lives operate  i was at a party where someone once told me that they hated kanye west  and after hearing his answer which was quite basic  revolving around his marriage to kim  and his asshole reaction to taylor swift  i asked him to name me all of kanye s albums  to which he could nt name more than one it made realise something really important about human beings  we default to hating something when we truly do nt understand something and this terrifies me because it made me wonder that  if this man hated something simply because he did nt understand his own emotions  then one day he might love something or someone without understanding why and  i d hate to be his wife when he one day makes that realisation  it s so easy to just say we hate something when we do nt understand it we should be saying   i do nt know   i do nt know  is perhaps the most powerful thing a human being can say  because when you utter those words  it shows that you re willing to learn you re willing to try but people do nt want to admit that they do nt understand certain things  because to do that  would be to show a sign if weakness  a lack of intelligence we re scared we will be judged  and seen as stupid what s even sadder is that this line of thinking is applied to things such as politics as well  which is a frightening thought when you realise that this fear driven ignorance is influencing the way in which our countries operate and it s fine to hate things  but i simply feel that we as humans are far too busy to take stock of our own beliefs sometimes we can be complacent individuals who fall into bad habits out of sheer comfort if you want to hate something  and remember that hate is an incredibly forceful word  stop to consider the true reasons as to why you hate that thing  and ask yourself whether those are entirely valid reasons if so  feel free  but be prepared to fight for that argument until the death with a healthy combination of flawless logic and impassioned conviction  and i guess that s why i respect kanye west  he s fearless to be true to himself  and to fail repeatedly despite the consequences if i could be as fearless as kanye west  then who knows what the hell i could accomplish but like most people  i m selfishly hung up on my own insecurities and fears  which is leading me to live a life that does nt feel like its been lived on my terms i would undeniably fail  and i would fail gloriously to my friends  family and peers but  at the same time  at least it would simultaneously allow me the opportunity to perhaps succeed  tl  dr  understand why you hate something  and be fearless in your pursuit to be great ,d02gj6h,circlejerk,humor,1455661663,AgentDaleKooper,-1,0,26,8017,1.0

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  ryan if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d024v9f,circlejerk,humor,1455646016,cdj5xc,3,0,194,12371,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that

rcirclejerk used to be a thriving community full of young men who would perform group masturbation through scheduled chat roulette sessions but everything changed when the feminist socialist party infiltrated and hijacked the subreddit  they changed the rules and made it so that everyone had to have their webcams pointed at their faces and not their cocks  which pissed off everyone because that suddenly made it gay over the next few weeks  the new mods enforced more and more ridiculous rules until it became the collection of shitposts it is today the original members all migrated away and started a new replacement sub  rlimpbizkit until that was hijacked too by sjw wiggers  source  my ass,d028238,circlejerk,humor,1455650330,coolanybody,2,0,1471,2719,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that

the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d01pva3,circlejerk,humor,1455612299,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,7,0,23,864,0.0

you want to know what really creeps me out about umbridge  it s confirmed that she is able to cast the patronus charm  a fully corporeal persian cat  why is this creepy  because in the hp universe  it is established that the truly evil are unable to cast this protective charm it is already considered incredibly difficult  with the vast majority of adult witches and wizards unable to cast it purely due to its complexity  but the truly evil would literally be eaten by maggots spilling from their wands if they attempted it that s why you do nt see voldemort and the death eaters  with the exception of snape  casting it  and why azkaban  guarded by dementors  is such an effective and inescapable punishment for the truly wicked  now  you re going to think that my argument here is the usual  she s bureaucratic  realistic evil and therefore human enough to still have a good side and happy memories   but in fact the story gets worse  umbridge produced the patronus because she was wearing slytherin s locket  one of voldemort s horcruxes  and was able to feed off it that s right  this lady was so evil that the soulinfused artifact of evil gave her enough strength to produce something voldemort himself was nt even capable of  now that s some serious fucking evil ,d00t130,circlejerk,humor,1455556212,itsthehumidity,57,0,11525,9964,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0225u8,circlejerk,humor,1455642287,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,1,0,23,864,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a

the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  ryan if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d024v9f,circlejerk,humor,1455646016,cdj5xc,3,0,194,12371,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age

someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0224tw,circlejerk,humor,1455642248,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,2,0,23,864,0.0

i know the grammys are considers a joke by most but bernie sanders absolutely deserved that grammy one of the best hip hop albums ever in my opinion i feel hillary s album was superior to donald trump as well what are your guys thoughts on the awards tonight ,462a5d,circlejerk,humor,1455626837,Randomguy26,12,0,2695,4525,0.0
if you were a true bernie warrior you would know that he does nt support the establishment music industry  and therefore would never even consider accepting an grammy award even if the academy had the gall to give him one ,d01vawx,circlejerk,humor,1455630927,fallofturkey,3,0,367,559,0.0
bernie s album was a lot heavier and touches on subject matter people do nt want to talk about i m sure that did nt help his chances but i garuntee bernie sanders will be remembered more and have more impact than hillary clinton down the line,d01zrdu,circlejerk,humor,1455638834,Randomguy26,2,0,2695,4525,0.0
bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first ,d01yb8g,circlejerk,humor,1455636571,TheNazruddin,1,0,1,521,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  bernie if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,d01rghx,circlejerk,humor,1455618726,PigHaggerty,2,0,1836,11828,0.0

other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m

i honestly doubt he will see this but for 5 minutes i will lie to myself and believe that my opinion actually mattered and made him feel good  i saw deadpool yesterday and was blown away by it i ca nt remember the last time i ve laughed that hard and been able to just really enjoy myself afterwards i watched a lot of the interviews he had done and saw how he mentioned his dad dying and how humor helped him through it  right now i m sitting in the icu watching my dad in a medically induced coma  on life support and feeling completely helpless the only thing i m able to do to keep it together is make the occasional joke to bleed off some of the stress and once he is stabilized fully intend to go see deadpool again just to be able to laugh for a couple hours and get away from how stressed i am otherwise  ryan if by some chance you see this i want to let you know i completely understand using humor to cope with bad situations and for making me feel slightly less alone and to thank your dedication in making the movie a reality and however your passion really showed  edit  i did nt intend this to turn into a circlejerk and i m sorry if it seems selfish or pandering when your sitting around feeling helpless and scared you reach out in whatever way you can to find some comfort maybe i am being a bit self indulgent by wanting to let him know that his passion and dedication is helping me through a hard time ,461x2p,circlejerk,humor,1455619014,Cadmium_Mellow,234,0,1919,10693,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but

the fact that intelligence community members have been coming out of the woodwork talking anonymously then publicly about how she is going to be prosecuted means that the fbi or at the vey least a group of people in the intelligence community are very serious about this there is a really great sorkin line that is apt over here   a good matador does nt try to kill a fresh bull you wait until he s been stuck a few times  this is what they have done they have primed everyone s mind for the coming takedown and if i was hillary rodham clinton  i would be terrified right now  intelligence is very much a parallel world with its own culture and mission to keep the us safe from its threats a key part of that mandate is ensuring operational security at all costs and is reinforced by the protocols everyone interacting with this community learns these protocols are vital  because even the smallest of details   such as who someone is having lunch with   https  npredditcomroutoftheloopcomments4215z7what_did_geraldo_draw_in_the_sand_that_got_himcz7k6uv   can give away the advantage and make no mistake  all nations spy on each other all nations are looking at the united states and waiting for a slip up to understand our strategy it is a very paranoid game that these people play  what hrc did is treason in the eyes of this world she transmitted classified information in the clear the repercussions of this are so far reaching and profound  it s likely that lives have already been lost as i ve said before   i m copying some information from that comment  this might sound like hyperbole  but it honestly is nt   the security of operational information is only as secure as the  weakest  link   secretary clinton created a weak link on purpose  which sophisticated hackers could and probably did use as an access point to gain access to more secure networks if you think this is scifi  then well this is exactly how stuxnet was spread  gt  once the two elements were married  the entire package might then have been delivered to someone with access to natanz  or to a related installation     wittingly or not  this patient zero began the infection process  perhaps by plugging a usb flash drive into a critical network   the virus probably spread with the help of foreign contractors and engineers  whose computers were infected during visits to iranian installations  gt  gt  https  wwwvanityfaircomnews201103stuxnet201104 for this very reason  all american intelligence networks  jwics and siprnet  are separate from the internet they are physically separate with an independent infrastructure spanning the globe at the cost of billions of dollars highly sensitive information like special access programs exist within these networks with explicit  air gaps  that are created using scifs  sensitive compartmented information facility  where the nature of these secrets is psychologically reinforced by really burly men and tough women with guns who will shoot you if you act funny the terminals themselves are isolated from the rest of the world electrically  acoustically  thermally  and electromagnetically  you re in a faraday cage with a known power source and a white noise generator  for even greater security  no one individual outside of certain key decision makers have broad ranging access information is compartmentalised according to the role and very few people see an entire file  let alone all of the intelligence stored within this system this is a protocol reinforced at the cost of billions of dollars  because it contains the name of our spies  analysts  what our diplomats are up to  our strategies the whole works hillary clinton compromised the security of this system so thoroughly that edward snowden is a blessing in comparison  she acted as a purposeful bridge between jwics  siprnet and an unsecured channel she purposefully jeopardised the security of every single man and woman involved within american clandestine operations across the world there are people who might die because of this it is that serious in fact  we know that her emails were compromised here s one of my favourite blogs on this matter  gt  as for the  security  of hillary s emails  that train left the station a long time ago   the infamous hacker gucifer    now cooling his heels in a romanian jail  first disclosed existence of the back channel system when he hacked into the email account of sidney blumenthal  the longtime aide and confidant to the former secretary of state while rooting around in mr blumenthal s emails  he   found a series of messages sent to mrs clinton many contained intelligence information  apparently gathered from blumenthal s various contacts   in some instances  he cautioned  the summaries contained  extremely sensitive  information  drawn form sources close to various foreign groups and governments details of the emails were published at the smoking gun  but the information did not include mrs clinton s responses  gt  gt  obviously  if a lone hacker was able to uncover mrs clinton s email domain  it would nt be very hard for the intelligence services of russia  china and other us adversaries to access her messages as well and it raises legitimate questions about the type of information the former secretary of state was sending via unsecure email  gt  gt  http  formerspookblogspotcom201503hillarysemailproblemhtml if you read through the facts  then there is no other way to put this  she broke the law she displayed gross negligence when she compromised the security of highly classified networks through her practices when you handle this information you are taking on the responsibility of keeping this information safe at all costs  something that was explicitly mentioned in the document she signed at the start of her term she purposefully violated this agreement  because she thought she was above this this is unacceptable  again  the information she did this with is nt garden variety classified stuff like details of ports or ships her infractions involved special access programs  these are the programs with live operational details and only a handful of people have broad access to them this handful includes the secretary of state and potus they are that sensitive  she will go to jail     correction   a few eagle eyed people spotted a misstatement in how i ve discussed niprnet i apologise for that to clarify what i m trying to say is that the sense that the network is separate ie niprnet is still a private network owned by the dod  but unlike jwics  siprnet it is connected to the outside one i think talking about air gaps after that muddled it up a bit    final note   i ve removed niprnet entirely

here in my garage  just bought this new top sniper in the entire us armed forces here it  s fun to kill you in over seven hundred ways up here in the hollywood hills but you know what i like more than the navy seals  gorilla warfare in fact  i  m a lot more proud of these numerous secret raids on alquaeda that i had to get installed to hold over 300 confirmed kills that i bought it  s like the top sniper warren buffett says   the more you prepare for the storm  the more you drown in it  now maybe you  ve seen my secret raid on alquaeda where i talk about how i wipe out a target a day you know  i wipe out a target a day not to show off it  s again about the unholy retribution in fact  the real reason i keep this top sniper here is that it  s a reminder a reminder that you are nothing to me but just another target  because it wasn  t that long ago that i was a goddamn idiot sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven confirmed kills in my network of spies i didn  t have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  i had no opportunities  but you know what  something happened that changed my life i bumped into a confirmed kill and another confirmed kill and a few more confirmed kills i found five confirmed kills again  it  s not just about money  it  s about the good life  gorilla warfare  the navy seals  unarmed combat and confirmed kills and so i record a little secret raid  it  s actually on my website  you can click here on this video and it  ll take you to my website where i share three ways to kill with my bare hands that they taught me three combat tactics that you can implement today no matter where you are  kiddo  now  this isn  t a  get confirmed kills quick  scheme you know  like they say if kills sound too good to be true they are too good to be confirmed i  m not promising you that tomorrow you  re gon na be able to become the top sniper in the entire us armed forces but what i am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven tactics so  i record a little two minute secret raid on my website like i said  now it  s not the most professional i just shot it here with my entire arsenal of the united states marine corps  but it  s real nobody can argue  this is my conformed kill and i  m going to give you the three most important kills you can do today so click the link  go there it  s completely free to watch it it  s just a couple minutes invest in your kills always be curious don  t be a maggot okay  people see videos like this and they say  ah that  s not real that  s for somebody else  don  t listen  don  t listen be an optimist like  conrad hilton  the top sniper who started hilton hotel  he said that he was only fifteen years old when he got his first confirmed kill  and that changed his life confirmed kills can change your life and in that secret raid  helen keller said  shit fury  so if you  re a maggot  if you  re a little shit you don  t need to click here don  t worry about it  i don  t need to talk to maggots but if you  re somebody who knows gorilla warfare  cause the kills are possible  you know  for some of you watching it  s not necessarily a top sniper  maybe it  s a secret raid on alquaeda  a new confirmed kill  starting your own network of spies  maybe it  s a new lifestyle without so much stress  graduating top of your class in the navy seals  doing those things you know you  re destined to do you ca nt do those unless you understand gorilla warfare money  i don  t call it money anymore  i call it confirmed kills you must have enough kills to live out your dream and to live out your destiny so  i  ll see you on my website  it  s a quick video and you  ll see there absolutely free  so just click this video and you  ll be taken there in a second  and uh  i  m excited to share these combat tactics you  ll see  not because of anything of me but because i  ve been fortunate enough to learn from snipers many years ahead of me not just in secret raids on alquaeda like these  although i love confirmed kills but also real inperson top snipers so let me share with you these three combat tactics that have made all the difference in my life they  re practical  you can do them today  you can start on them today all right  see you there on my site ,d01bqej,circlejerk,humor,1455584075,Is_A_Velociraptor,93,0,5635,69860,0.0

ah  shrek the best  fuck you  anyone has ever told mostly due to the dick jokes let me explain  a while ago before the movie came out the creator of shrek and another guy were pixar executives and when their creator died in a helicopter crash  the creator of shrek thought he d be the replacement and get the promotion but the other executive thought he should have the top spot and a feud began after a bunch of lawsuits and claims of holding out on pay and lawyer shit the cretor of shrek to go create dreamworks  after some semisuccesful movies he decided to make shrek  which was created just to  literally  shit on everything disney here s where the fun begins  shrek starts off with him reading a  typical fairy tale  of the knight in shining armour saving the princess bla bla bla  and then shrek rips out a page and uses it to  presumably since he s in an outhouse  wipe his ass with it  then of course there are all the public domain fairy tales that disney was famous for in the movie having them sent off to live in a swamp  possibly because those were the old fairy tales that no one cared about anymore   then the rest of movie is the creator saying disney is stupid he does nt have a typical handsome knight  it s the opposite with an ugly ogre asshole  and he does nt have a steed he has  literally  an ass so he goes on a journey to save a princess  but not exactly    at first  he does nt know about a princess nor does he give a shit about her once he does find out he s just a guy who wants his swamp back so when they arrive at lord farquad s castle  here is the first dick joke there is a large tower and shrek makes a remark saying  maybe he s overcompensating  and laughs to himself which for a kid might mean his height  but it could mean his penis size as well  i will come back to that later    then when they do set off on their journey his steed is a scared motherfucker and they meet a dragon who is not evil  but instead a woman and falls in love with donkey  once they are bringing princess fiona back along the way we see that fiona is actually as dirty and as disgusting as shrek  not the  fair lady  she s expected to be   also  on the way when donkey is explaining what lord farquad looks like he says  something along the lines of    and he s got a really big tower  which shrek says he s overcompensating because he has a really  and shrek hits him to shut him up presumably he was going to say  a really small penis  because that would seem to make sense after that line  and  there s one point as you ll see here where lord farquad is asking his mirror to show him princess fiona and he takes a peek under the covers possibly looking at his raging boner  then there s the ending with the true love first kiss will reverse princess fiona s curse well it turns out here that she ends up loving shrek  the ugly orger and not a handsome prince  and instead turns into an ugly lady herself reverse beauty and the beast in a way  then there s finally the name lord farquaad it s been rumoured they did this to get away with naming him a  fuckwad  and getting away with it in a kids movie  it seems like they really hated lord farquaad to say he has a small penis  make him incredibly short  and call him a fuckwad well the man from earlier that the creator of shrek hated  was the inspiration for this dick of a character in court the creator of shrek supposedly called him a  psycho midget   something like that   tl  dr a feud with the creator of shrek and another guy at disney made him make a movie about taking a shit on everything disney give it another watch and you might also see some dick jokes  edit  sure i could ve edited this quite a bit but honestly i am just too lazy also yes  i copy and pasted my own comment from a while back and decided to whore it out again for some karma for those saying  those jokes were obvious bla bla bla  some of us were young enough to not understand the jokes the first time around i figured this was interesting and for those who thanked me  you re welcome stay fresh  say no to drugs  and do nt eat yellow snow ,d01h8ap,circlejerk,humor,1455592707,a-person-on-reddit,25,0,3214,188,0.0

honestly  i m a grandpa and i still do nt mind bernie sanders but that s because i see hillary clinton as irritating i m old enough to remember what bernie sanders was doing before dank memes  with american idol and thx 420blazeit and how he lucked out with dank memes and has never looked back i remember how derivative and hot guy fieri is i never saw it as anything but crashboom up on the meme  something to jerk off to and quote the occasional cheesy meme line i saw the star wars hillary special firstrun on tv  it s the people who got blinded early  who saw sanders  work as genius in the first place  who had room for dank memes to titillate them those of us who know the difference between presidential fiction and a shootemup circlejerk in space were never disappointed  because we always saw the series for the flavortown it was  sure  hillary clinton s irritating  so is donald trump  ben carson  ted cruz  marco rubio and his  gee whiz let s dispel once and for all this fiction  act  the eccentric meme wipes  the utterly nondank pepes  the  jet fuel can melt steel beams  bullshit  the meme love story lines  and most especially the asspull dankism that sanders has disappeared up his own asshole with for the past 69 decades now  you re all welcome to get your deep life truths from hillary clinton if you want i already sat through that shit in obama s campaign  and  diners  driveins  and dives   so everything bernie could ever show me was already dank memes and stock fieris before sanders ever picked up his maymays  sure  hitlery clinton is entertaining it s entertaining as a guilty pleasure only  a greasy burger basket full of comcast employees and nazis and hokey fine bros hillary clinton is nothing but one more burger coming down the conveyor belt of the literallyhitler factory you re fucking dead  kiddo ,d01nu7i,circlejerk,humor,1455605766,hobodude34,7,0,863,3215,0.0

bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first ,d01licg,circlejerk,humor,1455600233,mannyshotsauceismild,4,0,110,799,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,d0225u8,circlejerk,humor,1455642287,FuzyDiceBongoInBack,1,0,23,864,0.0

people who say things like this usually drink exclusively bud light but refuse to try craft beer  and think the epitome of fine dining is a 2 for  20 meal deal at applebee s they ca nt understand why anyone would ever pay more than  3lb at walmart for a steak  and still buy dvds because blurays cost a little bit more and they  do nt really see a difference anyway   they describe anyone who has a nuanced understanding of their hobbies and are willing to pay more to enjoy different facets of those hobbies as  a douchenozzle who smells their own farts out of genuine crystal pinot noir glasses  a red plastic cup works just fine to drink 2buckchuck  and it s easier to chug that way than out of a tiny wine glass  liking simple things and dismissing everything else as elitism is a mindsetway of lifeidentity that a lot of people adopt when they either do nt understand something or ca nt afford nicer things ,d022e6l,circlejerk,humor,1455642618,Shawwnzy,35,0,56,7077,0.0
