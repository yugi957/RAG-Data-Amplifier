a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery he goes to the monastery  knocks on the door  and says   my car broke down do you think i could stay the night   the monks graciously accept him  feed him dinner  and even fix his car as the man tries to fall asleep  he hears a strange sound a sound unlike anything he s ever heard before the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind he does nt sleep that night he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound  the next morning  he asks the monks what the sound was  but they say   we ca nt tell you you re not a monk  distraught  the man is forced to leave  years later  after never being able to forget that sound  the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again  the monks reply   we ca nt tell you you re not a monk  the man says   if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk  then please  make me a monk  the monks reply   you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand when you find these answers  you will have become a monk  the man sets about his task  after years of searching he returns as a grayhaired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery a monk answers he is taken before a gathering of all the monks   in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound  i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for  by design  the world is in a state of perpetual change only god knows what you ask all a man can know is himself  and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception  the monks reply   congratulations you have become a monk we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound  the monks lead the man to a wooden door  where the head monk says   the sound is beyond that door  the monks give him the key  and he opens the door behind the wooden door is another door made of stone the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it  only to find a door made of ruby and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald  pearl and diamond  finally  they come to a door made of solid gold the sound has become very clear and definite the monks say   this is the last key to the last door  the man is apprehensive to no end his life s wish is behind that door  with trembling hands  he unlocks the door  turns the knob  and slowly pushes the door open falling to his knees  he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound    but of course  i ca nt tell you what it is because you re not a monk ,d012k9m,jokes,humor,1455569924.0,9tailNate,421.0,0.0,3941.0,1582.0,0.0

after quasimodo s death  the bishop of the cathedral of notre dame sent word through the streets of paris that a new bell ringer was needed the bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process after observing several applicants demonstrate their skills  he had decided to call it a day just then  an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer s job the bishop was incredulous   you have no arms   laughed the bishop  no matter   said the man  observe   and he began striking the bells with his head  producing a beautiful melody on the carillon the bishop listened in astonishment  convinced he had finally found a replacement for quasimodo but suddenly  as he rushed forward to strike the bell again  the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below the stunned bishop rushed down two hundred and ninety five church steps  when he reached the street  a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moment before  as they silently parted to let the bishop through one of them asked   bishop  who was this man      i do nt know his name   the bishop sadly replied    but his face rings a bell   the following day  despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist  the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of notre dame  the first man to approach him said   your excellency  i am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday i pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty  the bishop agreed to give the man an audition and  as the armless man s brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell  he groaned clutched at his chest  twirled around  collapsed and died on the spot  two monks hearing the bishop s cries of grief at this second tragedy  rushed up the stairs to his side  what has happened  who is this man   the first monk asked breathlessly  i do nt know his name  sighed the distraught bishop  buthe s a dead ringer for his brother,46673f,jokes,humor,1455678368.0,spanglebot,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

so there was this man in bulgaria who drove a train for a living he loved his job  driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child he loved to make the train go as fast as possible  unfortunately  one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash he made it out  but a single person died well  needless to say  he went to court over this incident he was found guilty  and was sentenced to death by electrocution  when the day of the execution came  he requested a single banana as his last meal after eating the banana  he was strapped into the electric chair the switch was flown  sparks flew and smoke filled the air but nothing happened the man was perfectly fine  well  at the time  there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention  so the man was allowed to go free and somehow  he managed to get his old job back driving the train having not learned his lesson at all  he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon once again  he caused a train to crash  this time killing two people the trial went much the same as the first  resulting in a sentence of execution for his final meal  the man requested two bananas after eating the bananas  he was strapped into the electric chair the switch was thrown  sparks flew  smoke filled the room and the man was once again unharmed  well  this of course meant that he was free to go and once again  he somehow manages to get his old job back to what should have been the surprise of no one  he crashed yet another train and killed three people and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death on the day of his execution  he requested his final meal three bananas   you know what  no   said the executioner  i ve had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed i m not giving you a thing to eat  we re strapping you in and doing this now  well  it was against protocol  but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal the switch was pulled  sparks flew  smoke filled the room and the man was still unharmed the executioner was speechless  the man looked at the executioner and said  oh  the bananas had nothing to do with it i m just a bad conductor   i stole this from a friend sorry mate ,462sr9,jokes,humor,1455635015.0,quincebolis,638.0,0.0,6013.0,24981.0,0.0

an old irish world war ii spitfire pilot and flying ace  was speaking in a church and reminiscing about his war experiences  in 1942   he says   the situation was really tough the germans had a very strong air force i remember   he continues   one day i was protecting the bombers and suddenly  out of the clouds  these fokkers appeared  there are a few gasps from the parishioners  and several of the children began to giggle  i looked up  and realized that two of the fokkers were directly above me i aimed at the first one and shot him down by then  though  the other fokker was right on my tail  at this point  several of the elderly ladies of the church were blushing with embarrassment  the girls were all giggling and the boys laughing loudly the pastor finally stands up and says   i think i should point out that fokker  was the name of a germandutch aircraft company  who made many of the planes used by the germans during the war   yes  that s true   says the old pilot   but these fokkers were flying messerschmitts ,4651qu,jokes,humor,1455662430.0,wadie31,4.0,0.0,1027.0,40.0,0.0

when he was 15 years old john heard the calling and joined the local monastery he took the vows of poverty  humility and celibacy  then became brother john  his job was to print bibles every day he would diligently copy the bible out by hand and then cover and bind the copies in leather  after 50 years the head monk told brother john that he had been an excellent and pious monk and that the monastery was having a retirement feast to honor him the next evening  the head monk then asked brother john if had ever had any doubts about his decision to join the monastery brother john replied  well to be honest  since we are copying the bible by hand i have often wondered how you know we have not made any mistakes   oh that s easy  replied the head monk   we have the first bible ever written down in our vaults so we know we are rewriting god s original words i will take you down there so you can see it yourself  so they went down to the vault and brother john began to read he missed supper that night and breakfast the next morning when it was time to begin the feast in his honor he still had not left the vault so the head monk went down to get him  when he entered the vault the head monk saw brother john sitting there  holding his head in his hands as his body was wracked with uncontrollable sobs   brother john  brother john   cried out the head monk   what is the matter   brother john looked up and cried out     celebrate       the word is    celebrate       ,d015px7,jokes,humor,1455574576.0,fuzzzybear,46.0,0.0,8.0,4352.0,0.0

after quasimodo s death  the bishop of the cathedral of notre dame sent word through the streets of paris that a new bell ringer was needed the bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process after observing several applicants demonstrate their skills  he had decided to call it a day just then  an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer s job the bishop was incredulous   you have no arms   laughed the bishop  no matter   said the man  observe   and he began striking the bells with his head  producing a beautiful melody on the carillon the bishop listened in astonishment  convinced he had finally found a replacement for quasimodo but suddenly  as he rushed forward to strike the bell again  the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below the stunned bishop rushed down two hundred and ninety five church steps  when he reached the street  a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moment before  as they silently parted to let the bishop through one of them asked   bishop  who was this man      i do nt know his name   the bishop sadly replied    but his face rings a bell   the following day  despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist  the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of notre dame  the first man to approach him said   your excellency  i am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday i pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty  the bishop agreed to give the man an audition and  as the armless man s brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell  he groaned clutched at his chest  twirled around  collapsed and died on the spot  two monks hearing the bishop s cries of grief at this second tragedy  rushed up the stairs to his side  what has happened  who is this man   the first monk asked breathlessly  i do nt know his name  sighed the distraught bishop  buthe s a dead ringer for his brother,46673f,jokes,humor,1455678368.0,spanglebot,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
