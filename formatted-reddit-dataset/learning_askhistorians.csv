you may be interested in  this similar question   https  wwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments3s6k0iposts_from_tankies_on_communist_subs_and_similar  about the use of marxian theory in history that i answered previously i do nt talk about historical materialism specifically  but marxian theory more generally  in terms of historical materialism specifically  i d say archaeologists have probably been some of the most enthusiastic adopters this makes sense to a degree since the study of archaeology is the study of material culture  and so the thesis of historical materialism is already in the wheelhouse of archaelogy one of the easiest things for archaeologists to determine from archaeological data is information about the relations of production in a society  and so historical materialism is attractive because it then proposes a way to use this easily generate data  on production  to talk about issues that are harder to discuss using archaeological data social organization for instance  v gordon childe  an avowed marxist in his political life  outside his research   has probably one of the more famous uses in his  neolithic revolution  model in this model  the development of craft specialists  aided by a transition to agricultural society  is one of the primary driving factors in the development of early states since he elaborated on this model in the 1930s and 40s archaeological research has indicated the origins of the state are much more complex than his fairly simple economic model  but that model still stands as an important component of the bigger picture even if it does nt tell the whole story ,d02aqqf,askhistorians,learning,1455653921.0,RioAbajo,3.0,0.0,1,4064,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,d02hfhi,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,DerProfessor,6.0,0.0,1,5631,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0
this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a

i think you may have misunderstood the explanation of salt mining in early modern poland working in a salt mine has always been dangerous and unpleasant work  but the king of poland held the rights to the salt mines as a royal monopoply the workers were usually free peasants  not serfs  so they were paid what was considered at the time as a fair prevailing wage of around 3 grozy as day  about 45 grams of silver equivalent  i guess    the miners were also allowed to take home a certain amount of salt each day as part of their compensation  they did nt have to buy in on the open market like everyone else  most of the rock salt mines in poland are in the southern part of the country  today near metro krakow  and supplied markets across central and eastern europe as far away as what is today hungary and romania  i suspect  based on my knowledge of early modern  patterns of trade  that fishermen in norway likely got their salt from portugal or somewhere else on the atlantic coast  as much or more than places in poland and germany in the late medival and ealry modern eras  1300s1700s   coastal and inland areas tended to have somewhat segregated commercial networks  becuase of the economics of transportation in that era  overland transport of bulk goods was very expensive compared to transport via oceans or even rivers  ,d018lf5,askhistorians,learning,1455579013.0,AshkenazeeYankee,33.0,0.0,15,4360,0.0

the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0

i think you may have misunderstood the explanation of salt mining in early modern poland working in a salt mine has always been dangerous and unpleasant work  but the king of poland held the rights to the salt mines as a royal monopoply the workers were usually free peasants  not serfs  so they were paid what was considered at the time as a fair prevailing wage of around 3 grozy as day  about 45 grams of silver equivalent  i guess    the miners were also allowed to take home a certain amount of salt each day as part of their compensation  they did nt have to buy in on the open market like everyone else  most of the rock salt mines in poland are in the southern part of the country  today near metro krakow  and supplied markets across central and eastern europe as far away as what is today hungary and romania  i suspect  based on my knowledge of early modern  patterns of trade  that fishermen in norway likely got their salt from portugal or somewhere else on the atlantic coast  as much or more than places in poland and germany in the late medival and ealry modern eras  1300s1700s   coastal and inland areas tended to have somewhat segregated commercial networks  becuase of the economics of transportation in that era  overland transport of bulk goods was very expensive compared to transport via oceans or even rivers  ,d018lf5,askhistorians,learning,1455579013.0,AshkenazeeYankee,34.0,0.0,15,4360,0.0

to set the stage  first  we can broadly divide the history of alandalus into several stages   1  rough unity under the umayyads  first as a branch of the damascus caliphate  then independently as the  caliphate of cordoba    2  the 11th century  fitna  or a period of divided rule by socalled  taifa  kingdomgs  3  rule by the north africanbased almoravid and almohad dynasties  punctuated by another fitna  4  just a few independent muslimruled holdouts as christian spain finalized its reconquista  second  at no time did muslims rule the entire iberian peninsula thomas glick observes that the dividing line was roughly climatological as well  with alandalus occupying the more mediterranean  olivefriendly climate zones and christian huddled up in the cerealgrowing  atlantic islesy north  by way of  international relations   sources are always going to be a problem for the earlier period starting in the 9th and especially 10th centuries  we have a clear picture of umayyad alandalus woven into a circummediterranean islamic trade zone there are some signs of maritime trade between andalusi ports  venice  and constantinople more so than muslim ships going to christian ports were christian and jewish merchants coming to southern iberia its overland trade with christian europe seems to have been almost entirely with the numerous christian kingdoms or principalities in its north  the border principalities paid a tribute tax of sorts to the umayyads by way of trade  olivia remie constable sketched out a relationship you might recognize  christian iberia sent commodities to the south  alandalus  luxury goods and more manufactured items went north along with  eventually  gold from the west african trade  during the more anarchic fitna era  islamic and christian kingdoms alike warred over the iberian frontier  making and breaking alliances with each other tribute payments also went both ways dependent on power  the almoravid and almohad dynasties restored a semblance of order to the geographicallyshrinking islamic iberia the revival of latin europe s economy especially after 1000  with some signs beforehand  of course  reoriented the european economy rising powers genoa and pisa became key trading partners for the 11th13th century muslim iberians interestingly  it seems to be the italians who sought to winbuy trading privileges with alandalus  not the other way around  the later dynasties also hired christian mercenaries and mercenary groups for their armiesa marked shift from how these two groups treated their native christian populations  by way of internal interreligious relations  islamic law starting with the quran famously establishes christians and jews as  dhimmis  or peoples of the book  subject to restrictions on religious displays and an extra tax  jizya  but tolerated and allowed to continue religious practices so much for the ideal what did it look like on the ground  under the umayyads  sources hint at an atmosphere of relative toleration and only a gradual attrition of christians converting to islam initially  in fact  the umayyads  discouraged  the lower christian aristocracy from converting they were nt powerful enough to pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

this is a difficult question because you may be talking about two economic practices that happened at different times maybe if you gave the time period the polish miners were getting rich  i know in norway that salt was indeed scarce during the viking age and medieval period which is why stockfish  t  rrfisk  that has been dried in the coolair and lutefisk which is treated in lye made from birch ash are food items in norway norway for a long time was the source to get stockfish because the conditions for curing it are perfect in more northern norway the stockfish trade was lucrative for the hansa in bergen trading it all over europe  my focus in norwegian history is mainly viking age so i ca nt tell you about when salt was more accessible to norwegians to use in treating fish but using salt to treat fish has not always been the case in norway and i am thinking that if these mines were operated during the medieval period that norwegian fisherman and fishmongers did nt have the access to salt thus the huge trade in stockfish ,d00w34a,askhistorians,learning,1455560660.0,VikingPaul,163.0,0.0,1,1513,0.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a theoretical point ,d01s16t,askhistorians,learning,1455621099.0,sowser,5.0,0.0,4,10053,1.0
with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

i ll focus here on three of the most famous resistors  minoru yasui  gordon hirabayashi  and fred korematsu all three of them end up at the supreme court one way or another  and in each instance scotus upheld the constitutionality of the internment process  happy to elaborate on the different legal strategies and questions involved in each case if folks want   i should also mention here that mitsuye endo  whose case eventually results in the dismantling of the camps  is also worth looking at but i do nt know her biography quite as well as i do the others  and i m not totally sure where she wound up during the whole process hopefully somebody else can help out there  on february 19th  1942  fdr signs executive order 9066  which grants the war department the authority to  to prescribe military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded  for reasons of military neccessity the eo did nt mention japaneseamericans as a particular target  but the order was definitely drafted with that in mind the process leading up to the signing of eo 9066 was a tremendously fascinating internal fight between the war department and the justice department  and fdr was actually remarkably uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0
this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

we do nt know much about mycenaean beauty standards  as most of their writings revolve around record keeping and trade rather than literary works  news reporting  or other types of writing the script of the mycenaean greeks  linear b  was not very good at encoding greek it was successful as a script because the limited nature of employment of linear b  in addition to experiencetraining and context  allowed scribes to understand what was being written  despite the origins of the script obviously being tied to another language in short  you re not going to find an epic poem like the iliad written in linear b  our best bet at answering your question will probably be by looking at the art of the mycenaeans and how they depicted themselves the mycenaeans painted beautiful frescoes  such as  this one from the acropolis of mycenae  ca 13th century bc    https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb99bla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg1280pxla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg   women are often depicted wearing colorful dresses and with their breasts exposed  quite different from the chiton or peplos that we usually imagine ancient greek women wearing we ve also found artifacts like  this   http  40mediatumblrcom209b8cb8aa05ce037388e4bab64744fetumblr_nnjjlvjmjp1us8irco1_1280jpg   which depict the face of a woman  possibly with makeup ,d02lmw0,askhistorians,learning,1455669475.0,sudawuda,376.0,0.0,257,637,0.0

to set the stage  first  we can broadly divide the history of alandalus into several stages   1  rough unity under the umayyads  first as a branch of the damascus caliphate  then independently as the  caliphate of cordoba    2  the 11th century  fitna  or a period of divided rule by socalled  taifa  kingdomgs  3  rule by the north africanbased almoravid and almohad dynasties  punctuated by another fitna  4  just a few independent muslimruled holdouts as christian spain finalized its reconquista  second  at no time did muslims rule the entire iberian peninsula thomas glick observes that the dividing line was roughly climatological as well  with alandalus occupying the more mediterranean  olivefriendly climate zones and christian huddled up in the cerealgrowing  atlantic islesy north  by way of  international relations   sources are always going to be a problem for the earlier period starting in the 9th and especially 10th centuries  we have a clear picture of umayyad alandalus woven into a circummediterranean islamic trade zone there are some signs of maritime trade between andalusi ports  venice  and constantinople more so than muslim ships going to christian ports were christian and jewish merchants coming to southern iberia its overland trade with christian europe seems to have been almost entirely with the numerous christian kingdoms or principalities in its north  the border principalities paid a tribute tax of sorts to the umayyads by way of trade  olivia remie constable sketched out a relationship you might recognize  christian iberia sent commodities to the south  alandalus  luxury goods and more manufactured items went north along with  eventually  gold from the west african trade  during the more anarchic fitna era  islamic and christian kingdoms alike warred over the iberian frontier  making and breaking alliances with each other tribute payments also went both ways dependent on power  the almoravid and almohad dynasties restored a semblance of order to the geographicallyshrinking islamic iberia the revival of latin europe s economy especially after 1000  with some signs beforehand  of course  reoriented the european economy rising powers genoa and pisa became key trading partners for the 11th13th century muslim iberians interestingly  it seems to be the italians who sought to winbuy trading privileges with alandalus  not the other way around  the later dynasties also hired christian mercenaries and mercenary groups for their armiesa marked shift from how these two groups treated their native christian populations  by way of internal interreligious relations  islamic law starting with the quran famously establishes christians and jews as  dhimmis  or peoples of the book  subject to restrictions on religious displays and an extra tax  jizya  but tolerated and allowed to continue religious practices so much for the ideal what did it look like on the ground  under the umayyads  sources hint at an atmosphere of relative toleration and only a gradual attrition of christians converting to islam initially  in fact  the umayyads  discouraged  the lower christian aristocracy from converting they were nt powerful enough to pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as they invited christian mercenaries from abroad to pad the ranks of their armies  the almoravids clamped down on muslims perceived as lessthanpious and it is sources from the almohads themselves that describe their brand of religious zealotry as  conversion or death   this would  again  apply to lesspious muslims  but tragically to jews and possibly christians as well we know of several massacres against jews who refused conversion  as christian armies gnawed away at the last vesetiges of islamic iberia in the 13th15th centuries  they would have found very little native christian population to greet andor fear them by that point  christians  and many jews  had already fled north or converted ,d027pma,askhistorians,learning,1455649861.0,sunagainstgold,5.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0

uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

this is a difficult question because you may be talking about two economic practices that happened at different times maybe if you gave the time period the polish miners were getting rich  i know in norway that salt was indeed scarce during the viking age and medieval period which is why stockfish  t  rrfisk  that has been dried in the coolair and lutefisk which is treated in lye made from birch ash are food items in norway norway for a long time was the source to get stockfish because the conditions for curing it are perfect in more northern norway the stockfish trade was lucrative for the hansa in bergen trading it all over europe  my focus in norwegian history is mainly viking age so i ca nt tell you about when salt was more accessible to norwegians to use in treating fish but using salt to treat fish has not always been the case in norway and i am thinking that if these mines were operated during the medieval period that norwegian fisherman and fishmongers did nt have the access to salt thus the huge trade in stockfish ,d00w34a,askhistorians,learning,1455560660.0,VikingPaul,164.0,0.0,1,1513,0.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0

the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

to set the stage  first  we can broadly divide the history of alandalus into several stages   1  rough unity under the umayyads  first as a branch of the damascus caliphate  then independently as the  caliphate of cordoba    2  the 11th century  fitna  or a period of divided rule by socalled  taifa  kingdomgs  3  rule by the north africanbased almoravid and almohad dynasties  punctuated by another fitna  4  just a few independent muslimruled holdouts as christian spain finalized its reconquista  second  at no time did muslims rule the entire iberian peninsula thomas glick observes that the dividing line was roughly climatological as well  with alandalus occupying the more mediterranean  olivefriendly climate zones and christian huddled up in the cerealgrowing  atlantic islesy north  by way of  international relations   sources are always going to be a problem for the earlier period starting in the 9th and especially 10th centuries  we have a clear picture of umayyad alandalus woven into a circummediterranean islamic trade zone there are some signs of maritime trade between andalusi ports  venice  and constantinople more so than muslim ships going to christian ports were christian and jewish merchants coming to southern iberia its overland trade with christian europe seems to have been almost entirely with the numerous christian kingdoms or principalities in its north  the border principalities paid a tribute tax of sorts to the umayyads by way of trade  olivia remie constable sketched out a relationship you might recognize  christian iberia sent commodities to the south  alandalus  luxury goods and more manufactured items went north along with  eventually  gold from the west african trade  during the more anarchic fitna era  islamic and christian kingdoms alike warred over the iberian frontier  making and breaking alliances with each other tribute payments also went both ways dependent on power  the almoravid and almohad dynasties restored a semblance of order to the geographicallyshrinking islamic iberia the revival of latin europe s economy especially after 1000  with some signs beforehand  of course  reoriented the european economy rising powers genoa and pisa became key trading partners for the 11th13th century muslim iberians interestingly  it seems to be the italians who sought to winbuy trading privileges with alandalus  not the other way around  the later dynasties also hired christian mercenaries and mercenary groups for their armiesa marked shift from how these two groups treated their native christian populations  by way of internal interreligious relations  islamic law starting with the quran famously establishes christians and jews as  dhimmis  or peoples of the book  subject to restrictions on religious displays and an extra tax  jizya  but tolerated and allowed to continue religious practices so much for the ideal what did it look like on the ground  under the umayyads  sources hint at an atmosphere of relative toleration and only a gradual attrition of christians converting to islam initially  in fact  the umayyads  discouraged  the lower christian aristocracy from converting they were nt powerful enough to pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as they invited christian mercenaries from abroad to pad the ranks of their armies  the almoravids clamped down on muslims perceived as lessthanpious and it is sources from the almohads themselves that describe their brand of religious zealotry as  conversion or death   this would  again  apply to lesspious muslims  but tragically to jews and possibly christians as well we know of several massacres against jews who refused conversion  as christian armies gnawed away at the last vesetiges of islamic iberia in the 13th15th centuries  they would have found very little native christian population to greet andor fear them by that point  christians  and many jews  had already fled north or converted ,d027pma,askhistorians,learning,1455649861.0,sunagainstgold,5.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0

you may be interested in  this similar question   https  wwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments3s6k0iposts_from_tankies_on_communist_subs_and_similar  about the use of marxian theory in history that i answered previously i do nt talk about historical materialism specifically  but marxian theory more generally  in terms of historical materialism specifically  i d say archaeologists have probably been some of the most enthusiastic adopters this makes sense to a degree since the study of archaeology is the study of material culture  and so the thesis of historical materialism is already in the wheelhouse of archaelogy one of the easiest things for archaeologists to determine from archaeological data is information about the relations of production in a society  and so historical materialism is attractive because it then proposes a way to use this easily generate data  on production  to talk about issues that are harder to discuss using archaeological data social organization for instance  v gordon childe  an avowed marxist in his political life  outside his research   has probably one of the more famous uses in his  neolithic revolution  model in this model  the development of craft specialists  aided by a transition to agricultural society  is one of the primary driving factors in the development of early states since he elaborated on this model in the 1930s and 40s archaeological research has indicated the origins of the state are much more complex than his fairly simple economic model  but that model still stands as an important component of the bigger picture even if it does nt tell the whole story ,d02aqqf,askhistorians,learning,1455653921.0,RioAbajo,3.0,0.0,1,4064,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

i know that the italian states was occupied with the unification wars for a while  but with their close proximity to africa it seems strange that they  and italy after the unification  did not establish a colony or protectorate in africa before 1866 when italy annexed massawa  especially considering that smaller countries such as  portugal  sweden and denmark all had colonies in africa before italy and the italian states ,463fxq,askhistorians,learning,1455642851.0,randomhistorian1,84.0,0.0,947,2613,0.0
the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a

with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

in relation to the coldsteam guards and indeed all of the household division  every single ceremonial soldier is also an active soldier  meaning that they all have the capability to serve internationally or however the monarch deems fit  this in practise is controlled by professional senior officers   guards by definition are not regiments of the line  they are protectors of the crown  however will often be tasked with line infantry work nonetheless this is especially prevalent after the napoleonic wars  where guards gained fame for their successes on the pensinsular war and in the battle of waterloo  and surrounding battles   in terms of their skill and aptitude  older regiments of the british army are often percieved by some authors to be better  due to the way the regimental system works a soldier s alleigance to  the colours  is one of the attributing factors towards older regiments fighting better  this book by allan mallinson details the intrigues of the british regimental system   http  allanmallinsonbookscomindexphpthemakingofthebritisharmy2   one of the best examples for the guards in the second world war is obviously the guards armoured division  which played a role in the normandy campaign in 1944  and then the liberation of europe it led xxx corps in operation market garden in holland to try and relieve airborne troops the guards armoured division also liberated brussels  in terms of recruiting  the guards division  known as the brigade of guards until 1968  ran their own recruitment process for officers up until the mid 1990 s there was not exponential demand for guards  the irish guards for instance only raised one extra battalion  the holding battalion  later known as 3rd battalion   british troops of the line in the second world war had less of a role to play than britain s unconvential  innovative ideas  the commandos for example  as well as the lrdg and sas in north africa ,d02ezx5,askhistorians,learning,1455659531.0,DeckedUnion,27.0,0.0,33,32,0.0

i ll focus here on three of the most famous resistors  minoru yasui  gordon hirabayashi  and fred korematsu all three of them end up at the supreme court one way or another  and in each instance scotus upheld the constitutionality of the internment process  happy to elaborate on the different legal strategies and questions involved in each case if folks want   i should also mention here that mitsuye endo  whose case eventually results in the dismantling of the camps  is also worth looking at but i do nt know her biography quite as well as i do the others  and i m not totally sure where she wound up during the whole process hopefully somebody else can help out there  on february 19th  1942  fdr signs executive order 9066  which grants the war department the authority to  to prescribe military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded  for reasons of military neccessity the eo did nt mention japaneseamericans as a particular target  but the order was definitely drafted with that in mind the process leading up to the signing of eo 9066 was a tremendously fascinating internal fight between the war department and the justice department  and fdr was actually remarkably uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

possible  but only towards the very end of the war japan and the ussr signed a five year nonaggression pact in april 1941  which both sides observed scrupulously until the ussr declared war on japan on august 8th 1945 at that point the soviets began overrunning japanese forces in manchuria you might conceivably have had an american military observer with those soviet forces  although that s pretty unlikely crewmen from a b29 forced to divert to soviet territory would be another possibility ,d02huds,askhistorians,learning,1455663555.0,TheBreadBossTheBread,1.0,0.0,1,4225,0.0

you may be interested in  this similar question   https  wwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments3s6k0iposts_from_tankies_on_communist_subs_and_similar  about the use of marxian theory in history that i answered previously i do nt talk about historical materialism specifically  but marxian theory more generally  in terms of historical materialism specifically  i d say archaeologists have probably been some of the most enthusiastic adopters this makes sense to a degree since the study of archaeology is the study of material culture  and so the thesis of historical materialism is already in the wheelhouse of archaelogy one of the easiest things for archaeologists to determine from archaeological data is information about the relations of production in a society  and so historical materialism is attractive because it then proposes a way to use this easily generate data  on production  to talk about issues that are harder to discuss using archaeological data social organization for instance  v gordon childe  an avowed marxist in his political life  outside his research   has probably one of the more famous uses in his  neolithic revolution  model in this model  the development of craft specialists  aided by a transition to agricultural society  is one of the primary driving factors in the development of early states since he elaborated on this model in the 1930s and 40s archaeological research has indicated the origins of the state are much more complex than his fairly simple economic model  but that model still stands as an important component of the bigger picture even if it does nt tell the whole story ,d02aqqf,askhistorians,learning,1455653921.0,RioAbajo,3.0,0.0,1,4064,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0

this is an interesting question  and one i do nt have any real answer for right now i ll check my library when home later  but just from the reading i ve done on the subject  this practice of targeting courthouses is nt something i ve read about when confederate forces were in northern territory  if they burned or destroyed anything  it was the supplies that they could nt raid or carry back understand that these would almost always be cavalry raids  and that these confederate forces would nt have had a lot of time before having to move on when in town  the practice was usually to maximize your time there by taking horses  wagons  and whatever food provisions they could carry  including stock   as for as northerners  again  this is nt something i ve read much about the union troops would have had far more time in  occupied  territory  so if anyone did it  i would have to imagine it would be them  sorry for the vague answer  i ll try to get to my books later to see if there s anything else that sheds light on this   sources i m referring to and doublechecking later are  bruce catton  mr lincoln s army  glory road  grant takes command  amp  grant moves south   james mcpherson  battle cry of freedom   jay winik  april  1865   doris kearns goodwin  team of rivals  ,d024sue,askhistorians,learning,1455645922.0,petite-acorn,7.0,0.0,969,6865,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0
this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a theoretical point ,d01s16t,askhistorians,learning,1455621099.0,sowser,5.0,0.0,4,10053,1.0
with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

we do nt know much about mycenaean beauty standards  as most of their writings revolve around record keeping and trade rather than literary works  news reporting  or other types of writing the script of the mycenaean greeks  linear b  was not very good at encoding greek it was successful as a script because the limited nature of employment of linear b  in addition to experiencetraining and context  allowed scribes to understand what was being written  despite the origins of the script obviously being tied to another language in short  you re not going to find an epic poem like the iliad written in linear b  our best bet at answering your question will probably be by looking at the art of the mycenaeans and how they depicted themselves the mycenaeans painted beautiful frescoes  such as  this one from the acropolis of mycenae  ca 13th century bc    https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb99bla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg1280pxla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg   women are often depicted wearing colorful dresses and with their breasts exposed  quite different from the chiton or peplos that we usually imagine ancient greek women wearing we ve also found artifacts like  this   http  40mediatumblrcom209b8cb8aa05ce037388e4bab64744fetumblr_nnjjlvjmjp1us8irco1_1280jpg   which depict the face of a woman  possibly with makeup ,d02lmw0,askhistorians,learning,1455669475.0,sudawuda,376.0,0.0,257,637,0.0

i ll focus here on three of the most famous resistors  minoru yasui  gordon hirabayashi  and fred korematsu all three of them end up at the supreme court one way or another  and in each instance scotus upheld the constitutionality of the internment process  happy to elaborate on the different legal strategies and questions involved in each case if folks want   i should also mention here that mitsuye endo  whose case eventually results in the dismantling of the camps  is also worth looking at but i do nt know her biography quite as well as i do the others  and i m not totally sure where she wound up during the whole process hopefully somebody else can help out there  on february 19th  1942  fdr signs executive order 9066  which grants the war department the authority to  to prescribe military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded  for reasons of military neccessity the eo did nt mention japaneseamericans as a particular target  but the order was definitely drafted with that in mind the process leading up to the signing of eo 9066 was a tremendously fascinating internal fight between the war department and the justice department  and fdr was actually remarkably uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

when i was visiting a salt mine in poland  we were told that the miners got to take a handfull of salt with them at the end of the day salt  being so valiuable  gave the miners the means to live a wealthy life  at the same time  when we talk about traditional curing of fish in my home country of norway  salt is used by the kilos when making the brine  norway was by no means a rich country  so how come our poor fishers could use salt by the kilos  while salt miners in poland became rich just by getting a handfull each day ,45xfn2,askhistorians,learning,1455555741.0,Toasterlad,340.0,0.0,1299,4651,0.0
this is a difficult question because you may be talking about two economic practices that happened at different times maybe if you gave the time period the polish miners were getting rich  i know in norway that salt was indeed scarce during the viking age and medieval period which is why stockfish  t  rrfisk  that has been dried in the coolair and lutefisk which is treated in lye made from birch ash are food items in norway norway for a long time was the source to get stockfish because the conditions for curing it are perfect in more northern norway the stockfish trade was lucrative for the hansa in bergen trading it all over europe  my focus in norwegian history is mainly viking age so i ca nt tell you about when salt was more accessible to norwegians to use in treating fish but using salt to treat fish has not always been the case in norway and i am thinking that if these mines were operated during the medieval period that norwegian fisherman and fishmongers did nt have the access to salt thus the huge trade in stockfish ,d00w34a,askhistorians,learning,1455560660.0,VikingPaul,163.0,0.0,1,1513,0.0
i think you may have misunderstood the explanation of salt mining in early modern poland working in a salt mine has always been dangerous and unpleasant work  but the king of poland held the rights to the salt mines as a royal monopoply the workers were usually free peasants  not serfs  so they were paid what was considered at the time as a fair prevailing wage of around 3 grozy as day  about 45 grams of silver equivalent  i guess    the miners were also allowed to take home a certain amount of salt each day as part of their compensation  they did nt have to buy in on the open market like everyone else  most of the rock salt mines in poland are in the southern part of the country  today near metro krakow  and supplied markets across central and eastern europe as far away as what is today hungary and romania  i suspect  based on my knowledge of early modern  patterns of trade  that fishermen in norway likely got their salt from portugal or somewhere else on the atlantic coast  as much or more than places in poland and germany in the late medival and ealry modern eras  1300s1700s   coastal and inland areas tended to have somewhat segregated commercial networks  becuase of the economics of transportation in that era  overland transport of bulk goods was very expensive compared to transport via oceans or even rivers  ,d018lf5,askhistorians,learning,1455579013.0,AshkenazeeYankee,34.0,0.0,15,4360,0.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance

with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

yes  the  chlamys  was worn by the romans  although in a manner different than the greek images provided by uiphikrates the roman  chlamys  was a sleeveless  anklelength cloak made from a singular piece of semicircular cloth it was worn over a patterned tunic  often referred to as a coptic tunic  as whole tunics have been preserved by the egyptian desert   and was fastened at the right shoulder with a crossbowshaped broach attached to the vertical edges were a pair of  tablia   square or rectangular patches of colored or patterned cloth the famous  mosaic of justinian   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons666meister_von_san_vitale_in_ravenna_003jpg  at san vitale in ravenna depicts the emperor and his senior officials wearing the  chlamys  costume the  chlamys  was originally a military cloak  and entered civilian fashion sometime during the late thirdearly fourth centuries ad as part of a broader pattern of military styles shaping civilian dress over the course of the fourth century  the  chlamys  and it  s associated garments   coptic  tunic  footed hose  open faced  campagi  shoes  military belt  became the characteristic attire of military and civilian elites in late antiquity in late roman officialdom  the color and patterning of one  s tunic  trousers  and  chlamys  denoted department and rank  and were thus critical markers of status ,d01whji,askhistorians,learning,1455633368.0,HatMaster12,2.0,0.0,1,3677,0.0

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

we do nt know much about mycenaean beauty standards  as most of their writings revolve around record keeping and trade rather than literary works  news reporting  or other types of writing the script of the mycenaean greeks  linear b  was not very good at encoding greek it was successful as a script because the limited nature of employment of linear b  in addition to experiencetraining and context  allowed scribes to understand what was being written  despite the origins of the script obviously being tied to another language in short  you re not going to find an epic poem like the iliad written in linear b  our best bet at answering your question will probably be by looking at the art of the mycenaeans and how they depicted themselves the mycenaeans painted beautiful frescoes  such as  this one from the acropolis of mycenae  ca 13th century bc    https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb99bla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg1280pxla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg   women are often depicted wearing colorful dresses and with their breasts exposed  quite different from the chiton or peplos that we usually imagine ancient greek women wearing we ve also found artifacts like  this   http  40mediatumblrcom209b8cb8aa05ce037388e4bab64744fetumblr_nnjjlvjmjp1us8irco1_1280jpg   which depict the face of a woman  possibly with makeup ,d02lmw0,askhistorians,learning,1455669475.0,sudawuda,376.0,0.0,257,637,0.0

i ll focus here on three of the most famous resistors  minoru yasui  gordon hirabayashi  and fred korematsu all three of them end up at the supreme court one way or another  and in each instance scotus upheld the constitutionality of the internment process  happy to elaborate on the different legal strategies and questions involved in each case if folks want   i should also mention here that mitsuye endo  whose case eventually results in the dismantling of the camps  is also worth looking at but i do nt know her biography quite as well as i do the others  and i m not totally sure where she wound up during the whole process hopefully somebody else can help out there  on february 19th  1942  fdr signs executive order 9066  which grants the war department the authority to  to prescribe military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded  for reasons of military neccessity the eo did nt mention japaneseamericans as a particular target  but the order was definitely drafted with that in mind the process leading up to the signing of eo 9066 was a tremendously fascinating internal fight between the war department and the justice department  and fdr was actually remarkably uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,d02hfhi,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,DerProfessor,6.0,0.0,1,5631,0.0

this is an interesting question  and one i do nt have any real answer for right now i ll check my library when home later  but just from the reading i ve done on the subject  this practice of targeting courthouses is nt something i ve read about when confederate forces were in northern territory  if they burned or destroyed anything  it was the supplies that they could nt raid or carry back understand that these would almost always be cavalry raids  and that these confederate forces would nt have had a lot of time before having to move on when in town  the practice was usually to maximize your time there by taking horses  wagons  and whatever food provisions they could carry  including stock   as for as northerners  again  this is nt something i ve read much about the union troops would have had far more time in  occupied  territory  so if anyone did it  i would have to imagine it would be them  sorry for the vague answer  i ll try to get to my books later to see if there s anything else that sheds light on this   sources i m referring to and doublechecking later are  bruce catton  mr lincoln s army  glory road  grant takes command  amp  grant moves south   james mcpherson  battle cry of freedom   jay winik  april  1865   doris kearns goodwin  team of rivals  ,d024sue,askhistorians,learning,1455645922.0,petite-acorn,7.0,0.0,969,6865,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

 this interactive from the  new york times    http  wwwnytimescominteractive20140708upshothowtheyearyouwereborninfluencesyourpoliticshtml  _r  0  shows you very clearly how people have voted in terms of us presidential elections by birth cohort confusingly  it shows voter s simulated preferences based on statistical models even before they re 18  which is slightly confusing at glancejust pay attention to what s going on around the 20 year line an important note is that this model is for americanborn  white people only as you can see  most cohorts do in general have a higher tendency of voting republican when in middle age and beyond  but that also complex things happen this particular model  and this is statistical inference  not exactly how people expressed preferences in surveys  argues that most people s preferences are most malleable between 1424  and that little that happens after age 40 affects how cohorts vote one of the more interesting things is that the cohort born roughly during the 1970 s has gotten slightly but consistently  less  likely to vote republican as they age these people came of age during a period where republicans were triumphant  and chilled a little over time you can see a slightly similar things in the 1940 s  for people who came of age in the eisenhower era  set the dial to  say  1974 and notice that this cohort of white americans is less likely to vote republican today than they were when they came of age in 1992 it s a hard chart to see the ideological splits by age at any particular point in time  since they are comparing people by at specific ages rather by election   but it shows you how cohorts can change over time what it does nt show you is how much recent voting have been effected by demographic changes  such that bush in 2000 was able to beat al gore among white people 55  to 42   but only barely win the election compare that to the last close election without a strong third party candidate  ross perot  you make discussing presidential voting trends more difficult   the 1976 election  where carter won 50  to 48   and ford won white people only 52  to 48   hispanics and blacks went very strongly for carter  there were just many fewer hispanics voting in 1976  hispanics made up 1  of voters and blacks made up 9   in 2000  hispanics made up 7  of voters  blacks made up 10   and asians made up 2   i know you re not asking about age  not race  but i feel like it s important for understanding the above model which is only based on white voters  otherwise the numbers would nt seem to add up  as a note to this note  bush also did particularly well with hispanic voters  compared to other recent republican candidates  getting close to 40  of the vote in a threeman race in 1996  73  of hispanics voted for clinton   if you look at the roper center data  an easy way to look at voting in each election by age group    you see that 1824 were more likely to vote for reagan than 2529 or 3049 year olds   http  ropercentercornelledupollsuselectionshowgroupsvotedhowgroupsvoted1984   though just as likely as 5064 year olds and less likely than people 65 according to the above theory  they came of age during reagan s tremendously popular presidency and so were permanently effected by his high approval ratings  but the effect dissipated slightly over time you see little peaks and valleys like thatdukkakis and clinton were most popular with the young  and  very old  for example  perhaps in part due to old southerners continuing to vote democrat as younger cohorts moved more fully into the republican foldif so  this would be a measure of partisanship rather than ideologybut i am not sure exactly what explains that   with a distinct dip in support among the 4559 year olds  but yes  for the modern polling era  in america  at the presidential level  the general trend is that the young as a whole vote to the left of the old as a whole  even if there are fluctuations within the subgroups whether you want to say the polling era began in the 1960 s or the 1970 s or even in the 1950 s  gallup proved the success of telephone polling using random digit dialing in the 1948  dewey defeats truman  election  but i do nt think they collected or at least released subgroup data for that election   in the second half 20th century we start to get good data about how subgroups of the population vote before that period  i m not sure it would be easy to tell which way the youth as a whole were voting  though we could see which movements had more youth activists  which is likely a decent proxy  though harder to collect and interpret than already published poll results ,d0136qi,askhistorians,learning,1455570835.0,yodatsracist,481.0,0.0,14317,77599,1.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0
this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

the reign of peter the great brought about great societal upheavals in 18th century russia which brought the country out of a sort of dark period and attempted to enable russia to catch up to the rest of europe western education was held in a very high regard  the style of dress was altered from a more traditional russian style to one that closely followed western european fashion of the day men were forced to shave their beards or pay a  beard tax   to make the population appear more civilized education in everything from medicine to military strategy was also closely reformed to match that of england  france and the low countries peter and his court travelled regularly to western europe and emulated everything that they deemed might be of help in aiding russia s advancement by the mid to late 19th century  it was not uncommon for a wealthy family to have western european tutors educating their children and the opportunity to send them to a fine western school with a curriculum closely mirroring one that might be found in london or paris unfortunately  this type of education could only be afforded to the upper crust of society  as the vast majority of russia at the time period that  anna karenina  takes place in were farmers with little to no money ,d02qg12,askhistorians,learning,1455676844.0,PetrogradHighSociety,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

the eic may have been a very vast network of commerce  but it actually had a great deal of financial difficulty over the years until it was finally dissolved in 1874 by the east india stock dividend redemption act of 1873 this was nt due to a decrease in value of goods but rather repeated issues with the company internally and its interactions with india  things really started rolling downhill when a drought struck bengal in 1769 instead of intervening or offering any assistance the eic raised its taxes  and the resulting strain on their credit and shares forced them to ask for a bailout from the british government in 1772  the eic tried to recover from their troubles by focusing on one of their largest exports  tea they were granted the privilege of cutting out the middleman and began exporting the tea straight to the american colonies  the resulting taxes from which led of course to the boston tea party in 1773   the eic managed to keep itself a float  if only barely  with the combined revenue of the tea and their secret opium smuggling from india to china however  they finally went belly up when tensions spiked in india with the rebellion of 1857 no longer confident the eic was worth its expenditures  parliament stripped the company of its duties and absorbed the assets and forces the company continued to exist in name only until the stock dividend redemption act finally shut it down for good  source  bibliography of the east india company isbn  9780712357784,d0195c8,askhistorians,learning,1455579893.0,GrannyVenom,46.0,0.0,167,51,0.0

to set the stage  first  we can broadly divide the history of alandalus into several stages   1  rough unity under the umayyads  first as a branch of the damascus caliphate  then independently as the  caliphate of cordoba    2  the 11th century  fitna  or a period of divided rule by socalled  taifa  kingdomgs  3  rule by the north africanbased almoravid and almohad dynasties  punctuated by another fitna  4  just a few independent muslimruled holdouts as christian spain finalized its reconquista  second  at no time did muslims rule the entire iberian peninsula thomas glick observes that the dividing line was roughly climatological as well  with alandalus occupying the more mediterranean  olivefriendly climate zones and christian huddled up in the cerealgrowing  atlantic islesy north  by way of  international relations   sources are always going to be a problem for the earlier period starting in the 9th and especially 10th centuries  we have a clear picture of umayyad alandalus woven into a circummediterranean islamic trade zone there are some signs of maritime trade between andalusi ports  venice  and constantinople more so than muslim ships going to christian ports were christian and jewish merchants coming to southern iberia its overland trade with christian europe seems to have been almost entirely with the numerous christian kingdoms or principalities in its north  the border principalities paid a tribute tax of sorts to the umayyads by way of trade  olivia remie constable sketched out a relationship you might recognize  christian iberia sent commodities to the south  alandalus  luxury goods and more manufactured items went north along with  eventually  gold from the west african trade  during the more anarchic fitna era  islamic and christian kingdoms alike warred over the iberian frontier  making and breaking alliances with each other tribute payments also went both ways dependent on power  the almoravid and almohad dynasties restored a semblance of order to the geographicallyshrinking islamic iberia the revival of latin europe s economy especially after 1000  with some signs beforehand  of course  reoriented the european economy rising powers genoa and pisa became key trading partners for the 11th13th century muslim iberians interestingly  it seems to be the italians who sought to winbuy trading privileges with alandalus  not the other way around  the later dynasties also hired christian mercenaries and mercenary groups for their armiesa marked shift from how these two groups treated their native christian populations  by way of internal interreligious relations  islamic law starting with the quran famously establishes christians and jews as  dhimmis  or peoples of the book  subject to restrictions on religious displays and an extra tax  jizya  but tolerated and allowed to continue religious practices so much for the ideal what did it look like on the ground  under the umayyads  sources hint at an atmosphere of relative toleration and only a gradual attrition of christians converting to islam initially  in fact  the umayyads  discouraged  the lower christian aristocracy from converting they were nt powerful enough to pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as they invited christian mercenaries from abroad to pad the ranks of their armies  the almoravids clamped down on muslims perceived as lessthanpious and it is sources from the almohads themselves that describe their brand of religious zealotry as  conversion or death   this would  again  apply to lesspious muslims  but tragically to jews and possibly christians as well we know of several massacres against jews who refused conversion  as christian armies gnawed away at the last vesetiges of islamic iberia in the 13th15th centuries  they would have found very little native christian population to greet andor fear them by that point  christians  and many jews  had already fled north or converted ,d027pma,askhistorians,learning,1455649861.0,sunagainstgold,5.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0

short answer  because mcarthur personally and through him the american occupiers in general believed in keeping the emperor clear of blame and using the emperor as a source of stability and legitimisation of the new constitutional democratic order  contrary to what some of the unsourced replies here are saying  this was not an objective opinion nor something broadly shared by everyone involved there were and still are those who seriously question this move and who believe at the very least the emperor ought to have been made to abdicate as a way of accepting culpability for not just the war with the us but the entire era of militarism leading up to it examples are historians john dower and herbert bix  for further reading i recommend the comments linked by uoldworldglory  and  embracing defeat  by john dower ,d02hq14,askhistorians,learning,1455663373.0,NFB42,8.0,0.0,1146,33854,0.0
it came down to two questions at the end of the war  1  what was his actual role in conducting the war was he a figurehead  an icon with the general staff actually calling the shots or was he actually involved in the strategy of the war 2  post war the us needed him  they needed him to validate the us occupation and to provide continuity of leadership with the general population most modern historians feel that he was wholly removed from the tactical level in the war and even at the strategic level had very little input  indeed when he announced the surrender of japan there were segments of the army which fought back and tried to block his announcement that japan would surrender post war macaurther knew he d need him in the rebuilding process and to get the japanese government and society working again  japan was utterly decimated at the end of the war  tl  dr  it s not clear he really had much to do with the war and the us needed him after the war ,d02h5oh,askhistorians,learning,1455662561.0,Orlando1701,2.0,0.0,7124,26901,1.0

it s one thing i can never find a good answer to it seems like if germanaustria had been allowed to join the german republic it would ve take a whole lot of steam from the nazis it was the goal of most pangermanists that were nt nazis as well also seems to me it would ve been a good idea to make the german reich a constitutional monarchy instead of a republic  but that s a whole nother can of worms and i know they only did it because of commies  but thats besides the point  immediately after ww1  almost every austrogerman wanted to join germany why did anyone think it was a good idea to prevent it  i know that not everyone was down for it when the anschluss actually happened near ww2 and it s pretty controversial  and mentioning it nowadays is pretty taboo  but right after ww1 it was really popular  and would ve saved a lot of people a lot of stress  why the heck were nt the germans allowed to unite  poor sods ,466ntr,askhistorians,learning,1455685135.0,jpomz,1.0,0.0,1,85,0.0

when i was visiting a salt mine in poland  we were told that the miners got to take a handfull of salt with them at the end of the day salt  being so valiuable  gave the miners the means to live a wealthy life  at the same time  when we talk about traditional curing of fish in my home country of norway  salt is used by the kilos when making the brine  norway was by no means a rich country  so how come our poor fishers could use salt by the kilos  while salt miners in poland became rich just by getting a handfull each day ,45xfn2,askhistorians,learning,1455555741.0,Toasterlad,340.0,0.0,1299,4651,0.0
this is a difficult question because you may be talking about two economic practices that happened at different times maybe if you gave the time period the polish miners were getting rich  i know in norway that salt was indeed scarce during the viking age and medieval period which is why stockfish  t  rrfisk  that has been dried in the coolair and lutefisk which is treated in lye made from birch ash are food items in norway norway for a long time was the source to get stockfish because the conditions for curing it are perfect in more northern norway the stockfish trade was lucrative for the hansa in bergen trading it all over europe  my focus in norwegian history is mainly viking age so i ca nt tell you about when salt was more accessible to norwegians to use in treating fish but using salt to treat fish has not always been the case in norway and i am thinking that if these mines were operated during the medieval period that norwegian fisherman and fishmongers did nt have the access to salt thus the huge trade in stockfish ,d00w34a,askhistorians,learning,1455560660.0,VikingPaul,163.0,0.0,1,1513,0.0
i think you may have misunderstood the explanation of salt mining in early modern poland working in a salt mine has always been dangerous and unpleasant work  but the king of poland held the rights to the salt mines as a royal monopoply the workers were usually free peasants  not serfs  so they were paid what was considered at the time as a fair prevailing wage of around 3 grozy as day  about 45 grams of silver equivalent  i guess    the miners were also allowed to take home a certain amount of salt each day as part of their compensation  they did nt have to buy in on the open market like everyone else  most of the rock salt mines in poland are in the southern part of the country  today near metro krakow  and supplied markets across central and eastern europe as far away as what is today hungary and romania  i suspect  based on my knowledge of early modern  patterns of trade  that fishermen in norway likely got their salt from portugal or somewhere else on the atlantic coast  as much or more than places in poland and germany in the late medival and ealry modern eras  1300s1700s   coastal and inland areas tended to have somewhat segregated commercial networks  becuase of the economics of transportation in that era  overland transport of bulk goods was very expensive compared to transport via oceans or even rivers  ,d018lf5,askhistorians,learning,1455579013.0,AshkenazeeYankee,34.0,0.0,15,4360,0.0
it was my understanding after visiting the same mine that they were paid handsomely as well as getting a handful of salt a day so i took away from it that salt mining was a wealthy industry  not that salt was extremely expensive can anyone confirm ,d011ip6,askhistorians,learning,1455568447.0,Higginside,15.0,0.0,236,1084,0.0
does anyone know how wealthy the peasants could actually get in mining salt in poland  i think that would go some way to roughly comparing the value of local salt to that imported from norway  terms like wealthy  can be somewhat subjective could they save up at a bank and use it to buy an estate replete with servants and settle in leisure  also like the other guy said  what time period was this ,d02arx1,askhistorians,learning,1455653963.0,impfireball,1.0,0.0,65,23,0.0

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,d02hfhi,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,DerProfessor,6.0,0.0,1,5631,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

toleration and only a gradual attrition of christians converting to islam initially  in fact  the umayyads  discouraged  the lower christian aristocracy from converting they were nt powerful enough to pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as they invited christian mercenaries from abroad to pad the ranks of their armies  the almoravids clamped down on muslims perceived as lessthanpious and it is sources from the almohads themselves that describe their brand of religious zealotry as  conversion or death   this would  again  apply to lesspious muslims  but tragically to jews and possibly christians as well we know of several massacres against jews who refused conversion  as christian armies gnawed away at the last vesetiges of islamic iberia in the 13th15th centuries  they would have found very little native christian population to greet andor fear them by that point  christians  and many jews  had already fled north or converted ,d027pma,askhistorians,learning,1455649861.0,sunagainstgold,5.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0

pose a threat or really affect the course of alandalus  and the increased tax was quite nice for andalusi coffers certainly the most powerful christians lost their standing andalusi courts were centers of intellectual life and culture that brought together primarily muslims  but also christiand jewish scholars i ve read that intermarriage between christians and muslims was fairly common  although i  think  this would have been primarily or exclusively muslim men and christian women  i am extrapolating from later medieval sources here based on continuity of law  so i am very open to being corrected   over the centuries  many    moriscos   mozarabs  or andalusi christians did end up converting to islam  and why not  scholars have talked about  conversion by the coin  instead of by the sword or by faith  and that reflects the picture we have from elsewhere in the mediterranean  the almoravids and especially the almohads were different by the 11th and especially 12th13th centuries  large swathes of the mediterranean world seem to have been focused more on uniformity of belief and exclusion of alternate perspectives this applied internally as well as externally even as they invited christian mercenaries from abroad to pad the ranks of their armies  the almoravids clamped down on muslims perceived as lessthanpious and it is sources from the almohads themselves that describe their brand of religious zealotry as  conversion or death   this would  again  apply to lesspious muslims  but tragically to jews and possibly christians as well we know of several massacres against jews who refused conversion  as christian armies gnawed away at the last vesetiges of islamic iberia in the 13th15th centuries  they would have found very little native christian population to greet andor fear them by that point  christians  and many jews  had already fled north or converted ,d027pma,askhistorians,learning,1455649861.0,sunagainstgold,5.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0
we do nt know much about mycenaean beauty standards  as most of their writings revolve around record keeping and trade rather than literary works  news reporting  or other types of writing the script of the mycenaean greeks  linear b  was not very good at encoding greek it was successful as a script because the limited nature of employment of linear b  in addition to experiencetraining and context  allowed scribes to understand what was being written  despite the origins of the script obviously being tied to another language in short  you re not going to find an epic poem like the iliad written in linear b  our best bet at answering your question will probably be by looking at the art of the mycenaeans and how they depicted themselves the mycenaeans painted beautiful frescoes  such as  this one from the acropolis of mycenae  ca 13th century bc    https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb99bla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg1280pxla_dame_de_myc  c3  a8nes  2c_frescojpg   women are often depicted wearing colorful dresses and with their breasts exposed  quite different from the chiton or peplos that we usually imagine ancient greek women wearing we ve also found artifacts like  this   http  40mediatumblrcom209b8cb8aa05ce037388e4bab64744fetumblr_nnjjlvjmjp1us8irco1_1280jpg   which depict the face of a woman  possibly with makeup ,d02lmw0,askhistorians,learning,1455669475.0,sudawuda,376.0,0.0,257,637,0.0
i ll focus here on three of the most famous resistors  minoru yasui  gordon hirabayashi  and fred korematsu all three of them end up at the supreme court one way or another  and in each instance scotus upheld the constitutionality of the internment process  happy to elaborate on the different legal strategies and questions involved in each case if folks want   i should also mention here that mitsuye endo  whose case eventually results in the dismantling of the camps  is also worth looking at but i do nt know her biography quite as well as i do the others  and i m not totally sure where she wound up during the whole process hopefully somebody else can help out there  on february 19th  1942  fdr signs executive order 9066  which grants the war department the authority to  to prescribe military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded  for reasons of military neccessity the eo did nt mention japaneseamericans as a particular target  but the order was definitely drafted with that in mind the process leading up to the signing of eo 9066 was a tremendously fascinating internal fight between the war department and the justice department  and fdr was actually remarkably uninvolved in the decision making process  but that s a whole nother questionone i am happy to answer  but probably best saved for a different comment   eo 9066 gives the military the authority to declare military zones and exclude persons from them the long short of it is that general dewitt  head of the western defense command  and his staff  declare most of the west coast a military zone and begin issuing proclamations requiring americans of japanese descent to be removed from those zones this was done piecemeal  through about 100 different orders over the course of about 5 months the piecemeal exclusion process was coupled with proclamations enforcing curfews and other restrictions on japaneseamericans  and it is these curfews that are the occasion for many early acts of resistance   in march  through war department prompting  congress passed public law 503  which made it a crime to not comply with the military proclamations  punishable by up to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  minoru yasui was outraged by this treatment of japaneseamericans when the war first broke out he tried to enlist for military duty on 9 separate occasions  and was denied each time for because of his race the racial internment program further frustrated him  and on march 28th minoru yasui deliberately broke the curfew order in portland by staying out in public after 8 pm he intended on making himself a legal test case he approached a police officer in the street  and informed him that he was a japaneseamerican in violation of curfew the police officer merely told him to go home frustrated  yasui escalated the situation by walking into a police station and announcing that he was in violation of curfew  thus giving him the arrest he desired he wound up indicted by a grand jury and released on bail he also disobeyed the removal part of the order  which came down later that year  and he got picked up by the fbi and remained in jail through the process of a federal trial yasui was convicted and sentenced to  5000 in fines and 1 year in prison  the maximum possible sentence he languished in jail for about 9 months while going through the different levels of the appeals process and losing his case at the supreme court after that  judge fee  who oversaw the original trial in oregon  ends up removing the fee portion of sentence and reducing the prison term to time already served having completed his sentence  yasui was then shipped off to minidoka internment camp in idaho  on may 16th 1942 gordon hirabayashi refuses relocation orders and turns himself in to the authorities  along with a 4page manifesto explaining his rationale for this act of resistance there are some differences to gordon s rationale as compared to yasuigordon hirabayashi was a radical pacifist quaker  and also  amusingly  the most passiveaggressive quaker i have ever heard ofhe was really intensely itching to be a test case   fbi officers spend a while trying to persuade gordon to just go along with internment he refuses  ends up going through the trial process  loses all his appeals  winds up with 2 concurrent 90 day sentences to federal prison gordon  in his own special way  ends up finagling things with the original federal judge such that he would be allowed to serve his sentences in a prison work camp rather than an ordinary prison  gordon hated sitting around in jail in seattle  and for moral and philosophical reasons wanted to spend his sentence doing what he considered useful work   but the only camp that could take him was the catalina federal honor camp  a road work camp outside of tucson  arizona the da has absolutely no money andor willingness to transport gordon from seattle to tucson but gordon somehow persuaded him to let him hitchhike there the da drafts a letter explaining that gordon is en route to tucson to enroll himself in the federal prison camp  and gordon  being the wonderfully amusing historical subject that he is  takes a slow  leisurely hitchiking trip across the country to tucson  stopping to visit some friends along the way when he arrived at the camp the staff were deeply puzzled  and explained that they had no paperwork on him and thus no way to admit him gordon insisted that he be admitted to the camp to serve his sentence the guards told him to go to town  see a movie  get dinner  and then if he was really sure he wanted to be admitted to come back and they would have paperwork ready for him gordon does so  and proceeds to spend his 90 day term in the federal prison camp after that he sort of bounces around the country  spends some time in idaho he later refuses to comply with draft board orders and ends up serving a year in a federal penitentiary on mcneill island for that conviction  of the three  fred korematsu is the most famous he was also the only one of the three who did not deliberately seek to become a legal test case korematsu wanted very badly to not go to a camp he had a white fiancee that he was deeply enamored with and did not want to leave her he assumed the alias of clyde sarah  claimed to be of spanish and hawaiian heritage  and had plastic surgery done to his eyes and nose in an effort to try to better pass it did nt work  and he was recognized as an american of japanese descent and arrested in oakland on may 30th 1942 he was convicted  ends up going through the appeals process  and the long short of it is that he winds up with 5 years probation after sentencing he is shipped off to the topaz camp in central utah  the long short of all this is that public law 503 provided a means for fining and imprisoning japaneseamericans who resisted internment in practice the behavior of law enforcement and the judiciary was geared more towards getting resistors to comply than it was towards purely punitive measureshirabayashi and korematsu both get comparatively light sentences  given the possible maximums  for violating 503  gordon s yearlong sentence for noncompliance with the draft board is a separate matter   and yasui s sentence ends up being mostly reduced to time served while going through the appeals process  i should note that there is also  of course  the question of resistance within the camps  and how that gets treated the civil and military authorities involved with the camps themselves used a number of different techniques to deal with those forms of resistance  depending on the specifics if anybody is interested in those forms of resistance it might be worthwhile to read up on the poston camp  where at one point  in response to conflicts with the camp management  an entire section of the camp went on strike and refused to perform any work  sources  the best comprehensive legal history for this material is by far peter iron s  justice at war   which was my primary reference in compiling this it offers an excellent  and very readable  account of the different cases the paragraph on hirabayashi also draws upon  a principled stand   which is a posthumous collection of gordon s documents compiled by anthropologist and historian lane ryo hirabayashi  who also happens to be gordon hirabayashi s nephew

the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

genetic evidence shows that rice   oryza sativa   was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china  about 10000 years ago the two main varieties today are chinese rice   oryza japonica   which despite its name is chinese and not japanese  and  oryza indica   which is mainly grown in india  from china  rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9000 years it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization  where it was grown as a staple along with wheat  there is a 3rd variety   oryza glaberrima  which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago  rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander  s conquests in the 4th century bc the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa  iran  from the first century bc from iran it spread westwards into southern europe  where it became fairly common by medieval times historically  all european rice was derived from  indica   not  japonica   in africa   oryza glaberrima  failed to spread very far there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa  but  indica  arrived sometime during the first millennium ad  and quickly replaced  glaberrima   probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this  indica  that was grown in parts of north africa  primarily the nile delta but it was scarce  and remained a small part of their cuisine it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous  part cooked and granulated for storage  boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables but wheat and barley dominated  rice was rare  more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india  who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them  and spread them to central asia and beyond you can follow this spread etymologically  for example  the indian  pulao  which is adapted into dozens of varieties of  pilaf  from afghanistan to turkey  all the way to  paella  in spain muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines  but this is relatively recent  it  s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today  their per capita consumption of rice isn  t really that great on average  people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year  which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60  s compare that to predominantly riceeating cultures like japan  where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg  and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine  it isn  t really their main staple rice is more common in  some  parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan  but these places are closer to india the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption  an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan  s   cuisine and empire   http  wwwamazoncomcuisineempirecookingworldhistorydp0520266455ref  tmm_hrd_swatch_0  _encoding  utf8amp  qid  amp  sr     if you  re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics  i can provide a few references if you want ,d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843.0,EvanRWT,4.0,0.0,61,41248,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0
 this interactive from the  new york times    http  wwwnytimescominteractive20140708upshothowtheyearyouwereborninfluencesyourpoliticshtml  _r  0  shows you very clearly how people have voted in terms of us presidential elections by birth cohort confusingly  it shows voter s simulated preferences based on statistical models even before they re 18  which is slightly confusing at glancejust pay attention to what s going on around the 20 year line an important note is that this model is for americanborn  white people only as you can see  most cohorts do in general have a higher tendency of voting republican when in middle age and beyond  but that also complex things happen this particular model  and this is statistical inference  not exactly how people expressed preferences in surveys  argues that most people s preferences are most malleable between 1424  and that little that happens after age 40 affects how cohorts vote one of the more interesting things is that the cohort born roughly during the 1970 s has gotten slightly but consistently  less  likely to vote republican as they age these people came of age during a period where republicans were triumphant  and chilled a little over time you can see a slightly similar things in the 1940 s  for people who came of age in the eisenhower era  set the dial to  say  1974 and notice that this cohort of white americans is less likely to vote republican today than they were when they came of age in 1992 it s a hard chart to see the ideological splits by age at any particular point in time  since they are comparing people by at specific ages rather by election   but it shows you how cohorts can change over time what it does nt show you is how much recent voting have been effected by demographic changes  such that bush in 2000 was able to beat al gore among white people 55  to 42   but only barely win the election compare that to the last close election without a strong third party candidate  ross perot  you make discussing presidential voting trends more difficult   the 1976 election  where carter won 50  to 48   and ford won white people only 52  to 48   hispanics and blacks went very strongly for carter  there were just many fewer hispanics voting in 1976  hispanics made up 1  of voters and blacks made up 9   in 2000  hispanics made up 7  of voters  blacks made up 10   and asians made up 2   i know you re not asking about age  not race  but i feel like it s important for understanding the above model which is only based on white voters  otherwise the numbers would nt seem to add up  as a note to this note  bush also did particularly well with hispanic voters  compared to other recent republican candidates  getting close to 40  of the vote in a threeman race in 1996  73  of hispanics voted for clinton   if you look at the roper center data  an easy way to look at voting in each election by age group    you see that 1824 were more likely to vote for reagan than 2529 or 3049 year olds   http  ropercentercornelledupollsuselectionshowgroupsvotedhowgroupsvoted1984   though just as likely as 5064 year olds and less likely than people 65 according to the above theory  they came of age during reagan s tremendously popular presidency and so were permanently effected by his high approval ratings  but the effect dissipated slightly over time you see little peaks and valleys like thatdukkakis and clinton were most popular with the young  and  very old  for example  perhaps in part due to old southerners continuing to vote democrat as younger cohorts moved more fully into the republican foldif so  this would be a measure of partisanship rather than ideologybut i am not sure exactly what explains that   with a distinct dip in support among the 4559 year olds  but yes  for the modern polling era  in america  at the presidential level  the general trend is that the young as a whole vote to the left of the old as a whole  even if there are fluctuations within the subgroups whether you want to say the polling era began in the 1960 s or the 1970 s or even in the 1950 s  gallup proved the success of telephone polling using random digit dialing in the 1948  dewey defeats truman  election  but i do nt think they collected or at least released subgroup data for that election   in the second half 20th century we start to get good data about how subgroups of the population vote before that period  i m not sure it would be easy to tell which way the youth as a whole were voting  though we could see which movements had more youth activists  which is likely a decent proxy  though harder to collect and interpret than already published poll results ,d0136qi,askhistorians,learning,1455570835.0,yodatsracist,481.0,0.0,14317,77599,1.0

the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,d02q0t7,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,talondearg,6.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0

when historians of premodern western civilization  at least  consider  disability  and persons with disabilities in history  they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the  social model of disability  this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability   impairment  refers to a deviation from the  norm   be it physical  cognitive  behavioralpsychological  etc  disability  is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it  the physical and societal barriers to participation in society  negative attitudes  and general exclusion essentially  it focuses on  public perceptions and social structure  as the defining features of disability  rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual  while the social model of disability has its modernday critics  of course  welcome to the world of critical theory   it is enormously useful for historians  our job is not to reversediagnose our subjects instead  we seek to understand them in the terms of their day  a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg  margareta contracta   margaret was lameunable to walk since childhood but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg  her impairment was perceived as a sign of god s  grace   not his judgment of her sin she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress  confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and  in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion  offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window  margaret was clearly  impaired   but was she truly  disabled   either way you personally want to judge it  she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did nt count towards  disability  under particular circumstances ,d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439.0,sunagainstgold,9.0,0.0,1,30000,1.0
gt  is disability a form of subalternaeity  i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it s a fascinating question  but i m just going to offer some brief thoughts  gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one s own community  which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power  in postcolonial critical theory  that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern can not speak   in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from the subaltern can be  listened to  by those power structures but it will not be  heard  in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up  if we take the social model of disability usunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability proper  and impairment  then there s a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic  to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is  in some way  pushed out of the dominant power structure in society but disability permeates across all lines of class  gender and race  there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be  completely  excluded from institutions of power the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not  contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker   can not the same be true of disability  it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly  excluded  from it  yet perceptions of disability themselves  and what qualifies as disability  can be used as a tool for othering that  creates  a condition of subalternity consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of female hysteria   a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis  but rather represents an attempt to medicalise   in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding  quite normal phenomena in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were othered  and could be pushed into a space that  at its extremes  certainly featured the social  cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them  per se   it was their gender  the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman s position in the hegemonic power structure neither women nor the differentlyabled are inherently subaltern in this particular context  marginalised  yes  but not necessarily excluded in neartotality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power  but in the intersection of the two  in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women  it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity  or something closely resembling it  on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction  conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time my  very catholic  for the record  mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow  we would nt know because he d end up on a ward in a mental hospital the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mentalemotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised  or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today   there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions  which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines  today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life another user  whilst disputing the specific diagnosis  also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself i regret that i can not find that discussion now  but it was an interesting one i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it  although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed  that is not a particularly helpful exercise  and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy when we do that  we risk ourselves speaking  for  the people we study rather than  from  the record  i would say  then  that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality the way in which disability is  used  and  understood  by contemporary institutions  however   can  make people subaltern and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory  gt  what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability  i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in  african american slavery and disability  bodies  property and power in the antebellum south  1800  1860   2015   which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery  most fascinatingly in my mind  she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and selfempowerment  edit  also  feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria it just seemed a useful  familiar example for illustrating a theoretical point ,d01s16t,askhistorians,learning,1455621099.0,sowser,5.0,0.0,4,10053,1.0
with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle  by which i mean  i ve seen an entire 2 articles about it  which is for the quiet field of eunuch studies an unprecedented boom  i am honestly not sure entirely how to feel about framing eunuchs as disabled  because i do nt think it s true to the societies they lived in to be a bit cheesy  i think in many ways they do fit the idea of  differently abled  the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly  eunuchs  and not just  castrated men   these people were not seen as merely injured men  they were their own variety of people  with their own appropriate social roles  gender identity  and so on unlike most people studied under disability studies  they were carefully and ritualistically created  these were no accidental castrations while castration did disable the body  by removing generative ability  it also changed the body to make it a eunuch  which in many ways gave it  special powers  some of the special powers can be quite literal  like the semimagical and still legendary singing voices of the italian castrati  or more metaphorical  like the purity and holy powers of the eunuchs of byzantium and medinamecca  while i have some problems with the idea of disability and eunuchs  i still very much appreciate the current trends in body history and disability history giving us new ways to think about and clarify what eunuchs were and were not in their societies ,d01xksb,askhistorians,learning,1455635341.0,caffarelli,5.0,0.0,3726,46618,0.0

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,d02hfhi,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,DerProfessor,6.0,0.0,1,5631,0.0

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

 this interactive from the  new york times    http  wwwnytimescominteractive20140708upshothowtheyearyouwereborninfluencesyourpoliticshtml  _r  0  shows you very clearly how people have voted in terms of us presidential elections by birth cohort confusingly  it shows voter s simulated preferences based on statistical models even before they re 18  which is slightly confusing at glancejust pay attention to what s going on around the 20 year line an important note is that this model is for americanborn  white people only as you can see  most cohorts do in general have a higher tendency of voting republican when in middle age and beyond  but that also complex things happen this particular model  and this is statistical inference  not exactly how people expressed preferences in surveys  argues that most people s preferences are most malleable between 1424  and that little that happens after age 40 affects how cohorts vote one of the more interesting things is that the cohort born roughly during the 1970 s has gotten slightly but consistently  less  likely to vote republican as they age these people came of age during a period where republicans were triumphant  and chilled a little over time you can see a slightly similar things in the 1940 s  for people who came of age in the eisenhower era  set the dial to  say  1974 and notice that this cohort of white americans is less likely to vote republican today than they were when they came of age in 1992 it s a hard chart to see the ideological splits by age at any particular point in time  since they are comparing people by at specific ages rather by election   but it shows you how cohorts can change over time what it does nt show you is how much recent voting have been effected by demographic changes  such that bush in 2000 was able to beat al gore among white people 55  to 42   but only barely win the election compare that to the last close election without a strong third party candidate  ross perot  you make discussing presidential voting trends more difficult   the 1976 election  where carter won 50  to 48   and ford won white people only 52  to 48   hispanics and blacks went very strongly for carter  there were just many fewer hispanics voting in 1976  hispanics made up 1  of voters and blacks made up 9   in 2000  hispanics made up 7  of voters  blacks made up 10   and asians made up 2   i know you re not asking about age  not race  but i feel like it s important for understanding the above model which is only based on white voters  otherwise the numbers would nt seem to add up  as a note to this note  bush also did particularly well with hispanic voters  compared to other recent republican candidates  getting close to 40  of the vote in a threeman race in 1996  73  of hispanics voted for clinton   if you look at the roper center data  an easy way to look at voting in each election by age group    you see that 1824 were more likely to vote for reagan than 2529 or 3049 year olds   http  ropercentercornelledupollsuselectionshowgroupsvotedhowgroupsvoted1984   though just as likely as 5064 year olds and less likely than people 65 according to the above theory  they came of age during reagan s tremendously popular presidency and so were permanently effected by his high approval ratings  but the effect dissipated slightly over time you see little peaks and valleys like thatdukkakis and clinton were most popular with the young  and  very old  for example  perhaps in part due to old southerners continuing to vote democrat as younger cohorts moved more fully into the republican foldif so  this would be a measure of partisanship rather than ideologybut i am not sure exactly what explains that   with a distinct dip in support among the 4559 year olds  but yes  for the modern polling era  in america  at the presidential level  the general trend is that the young as a whole vote to the left of the old as a whole  even if there are fluctuations within the subgroups whether you want to say the polling era began in the 1960 s or the 1970 s or even in the 1950 s  gallup proved the success of telephone polling using random digit dialing in the 1948  dewey defeats truman  election  but i do nt think they collected or at least released subgroup data for that election   in the second half 20th century we start to get good data about how subgroups of the population vote before that period  i m not sure it would be easy to tell which way the youth as a whole were voting  though we could see which movements had more youth activists  which is likely a decent proxy  though harder to collect and interpret than already published poll results ,d0136qi,askhistorians,learning,1455570835.0,yodatsracist,481.0,0.0,14317,77599,1.0

i know that the italian states was occupied with the unification wars for a while  but with their close proximity to africa it seems strange that they  and italy after the unification  did not establish a colony or protectorate in africa before 1866 when italy annexed massawa  especially considering that smaller countries such as  portugal  sweden and denmark all had colonies in africa before italy and the italian states ,463fxq,askhistorians,learning,1455642851.0,randomhistorian1,84.0,0.0,947,2613,0.0
the most important reason is that from the beginning of the european colonial period until unification italy was made up of small states that were under foreign domination just as the age of discovery was getting started italy was invaded by france  spain and other countries in the italian wars  1494  1559   these ended with spain dominating italy from 1559  1713  and subsequently austria dominating it 1713  1796  ending with napoleon s occupation so during this period italy was more like a colony of outside powers itself than an independent power able to establish its own colonies during the 19th century prior to the date of 1866 that you give  italian states were too preoccupied with overthrowing the austrian domination that had been restored with the congress of vienna 1815 and with the unification struggle to give a thought to foreign colonies  it s an interesting question whether italian states would have established colonies in africa during the period that other european states were in the absence of foreign domination i ca nt give an answer but there are several factors that would mitigate against it some relevant factors are the following   before the age of discovery  italy  venice specifically  was the centre of european trade with asia  via the ottoman or egyptian mamluk empires   portugal and spain  motivated by desire to circumvent these trade routes  and by an antimuslim crusading spirit  find alternative trade routes to asia  and america  dividing the new opportunities up between them in the pope approved treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza therefore italian states lose out here  even in the absence of the subsequent spanish occupation  as their trade monopoly with asia is broken venice actually  supported   https  enwikipediaorgwikibattle_of_chaul  mamluk egypt against portugal once portugal started capturing indian ocean trade for itself   from the late 16th century into the 17th century  protestant powers reject the catholic spanish and portuguese monopoly on the new discoveries  see dutch hugo grotius   free seas    https  enwikipediaorgwikimare_liberum  proposition   resulting in competition for the portuguese in africa and asia  with many colonies being taken over by the dutch italy  being catholic  may not have been able to reject the portuguese african monopoly so easily from a legal perspective  so italian states had weaker motivations than other european countries to establish colonies  even in the absence of foreign domination  prior to the nationalprestige driven colonialisation of africa in the late 19th century ,d02ncgf,askhistorians,learning,1455672111.0,PicturesOfBilly,7.0,0.0,5,507,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,d02qjke,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,talondearg,5.0,0.0,27,16414,1.0
this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,d02paxr,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,a_wise_old_black_man,3.0,0.0,1,4571,0.0

this is a difficult question because you may be talking about two economic practices that happened at different times maybe if you gave the time period the polish miners were getting rich  i know in norway that salt was indeed scarce during the viking age and medieval period which is why stockfish  t  rrfisk  that has been dried in the coolair and lutefisk which is treated in lye made from birch ash are food items in norway norway for a long time was the source to get stockfish because the conditions for curing it are perfect in more northern norway the stockfish trade was lucrative for the hansa in bergen trading it all over europe  my focus in norwegian history is mainly viking age so i ca nt tell you about when salt was more accessible to norwegians to use in treating fish but using salt to treat fish has not always been the case in norway and i am thinking that if these mines were operated during the medieval period that norwegian fisherman and fishmongers did nt have the access to salt thus the huge trade in stockfish ,d00w34a,askhistorians,learning,1455560660.0,VikingPaul,163.0,0.0,1,1513,0.0
i think you may have misunderstood the explanation of salt mining in early modern poland working in a salt mine has always been dangerous and unpleasant work  but the king of poland held the rights to the salt mines as a royal monopoply the workers were usually free peasants  not serfs  so they were paid what was considered at the time as a fair prevailing wage of around 3 grozy as day  about 45 grams of silver equivalent  i guess    the miners were also allowed to take home a certain amount of salt each day as part of their compensation  they did nt have to buy in on the open market like everyone else  most of the rock salt mines in poland are in the southern part of the country  today near metro krakow  and supplied markets across central and eastern europe as far away as what is today hungary and romania  i suspect  based on my knowledge of early modern  patterns of trade  that fishermen in norway likely got their salt from portugal or somewhere else on the atlantic coast  as much or more than places in poland and germany in the late medival and ealry modern eras  1300s1700s   coastal and inland areas tended to have somewhat segregated commercial networks  becuase of the economics of transportation in that era  overland transport of bulk goods was very expensive compared to transport via oceans or even rivers  ,d018lf5,askhistorians,learning,1455579013.0,AshkenazeeYankee,34.0,0.0,15,4360,0.0

this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

not really i do nt know a place where foucault is directly refuted  but i d have to say that  in my rather unscientific mental survey  most discussions of the subject revolve around gnostic influences and the mind body dualism inherited from neoplatonism these ideas both fed and were reinforced by galenic theory  which defined women as failed men and there was a definite aversion to sexual contact from the letters of paul onward  made clearly manifest in the lives of the ascetic desert fathers  neither of which are classified as  medieval   nor is  guilt  quite the right word to define medieval attitudes towards sexuality procreation was  of course  natural  and there is a great deal of material evidence for a rather more blas  medieval attitude towards sex than we would otherwise think my favorite is still a  pilgrim s badge   http  iimgurcomrje6iwtjpg  depicting penises carrying the holy vagina  ie christ s side wound  in solemn procession  when reading foucault  it s kind of important to always remember that he s not a trained historian  nor is he interested in being one moreover  his project is much more concerned with modernity than it is with creating an objectively accurate representation of historical reality he is generally very prone to  reading back  ideas  i would look at peter brown s  the body and society   maureen miller s article  masculinity  reform  and clerical culture  narratives of episcopal holiness in the gregorian reform era   in church history  2003   and pretty much anything carolyn walker bynum has ever written ,d02u8ps,askhistorians,learning,1455683172.0,SheepExplosion,2.0,0.0,1,1470,0.0

one could argue for two key reasons  first  the irish and scottish lands are not as resourceful as those of england  especially southern england  the land of which offered opportunity for increasingly intensive agriculture from the iron age on ireland has a lot of copper and gold in the bronze age  but this was quickly tapped out and by the iron age it was a backwater  two  geography england s proximity to the continent meant that there was a lot of invasion  immigration  cultural comingling  and diffusion of technology this arguably put the people in charge of that area in an increasingly stronger position to subjugate the irish and scots ,d02gtor,askhistorians,learning,1455662076.0,tbickle76,7.0,0.0,1,418,0.0

part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question  gt  one of the greatest misunderstanding of preconversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings the first is that religions do not change while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent  even they change over time belief systems without a written text change radically over time  gt  the second misunderstanding is related to the first  but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twentyfirst century  applying that understanding of an institution onto a preconversion belief system the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy  and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic  singular in belief and practice  gt  in reality  preconversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental beliefs were certainly different from place to place  from generation to generation  and from person to person using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with premodern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith  for example  beliefs could even change as a person became older belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central  government   for lack of a better word  referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations   one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is  which pagans   and during  what period   each circumstance was difference  and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the nonconverted community to the monotheistic religion  many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions  and christianity could be grouped loosely with these  as creepy cults that subverted good oldfashioned roman values and society this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses  mormons  or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point  many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe preconversion belief systems in a preliterate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic  they were amorphous  and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world  what s one more  after all  there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways  but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change that said  whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort  the reaction against that change is  typically too late to stop the process  perhaps this is nt much of an answer  but it may give you some things to chew on others could certainly add other perspectives ,d02ccs9,askhistorians,learning,1455656019.0,itsallfolklore,11.0,0.0,131,23237,0.0

this is an interesting question  and one i do nt have any real answer for right now i ll check my library when home later  but just from the reading i ve done on the subject  this practice of targeting courthouses is nt something i ve read about when confederate forces were in northern territory  if they burned or destroyed anything  it was the supplies that they could nt raid or carry back understand that these would almost always be cavalry raids  and that these confederate forces would nt have had a lot of time before having to move on when in town  the practice was usually to maximize your time there by taking horses  wagons  and whatever food provisions they could carry  including stock   as for as northerners  again  this is nt something i ve read much about the union troops would have had far more time in  occupied  territory  so if anyone did it  i would have to imagine it would be them  sorry for the vague answer  i ll try to get to my books later to see if there s anything else that sheds light on this   sources i m referring to and doublechecking later are  bruce catton  mr lincoln s army  glory road  grant takes command  amp  grant moves south   james mcpherson  battle cry of freedom   jay winik  april  1865   doris kearns goodwin  team of rivals  ,d024sue,askhistorians,learning,1455645922.0,petite-acorn,7.0,0.0,969,6865,0.0
this is my first answer on askhistorians so i welcome corrections  criticism and expansion from the more experienced members of askhistorians  it s hard to answer this first part of your question  as a positive or negative effect on society is pretty subjective  but my amateur inquiry into this era leads me to believe i can answer regarding the economy side of the question  in the time period immediately leading up to and including the reign of king alfred the great   10th c  the answer depends on what you were for some the viking raids were devastating economically monasteries were looted and stripped of their substantial wealth now  of course most of our sources on these raids come with a heavy bias a great deal of the chroniclers of that time period were christians  and often clergy or monks they tended to have a heavy doom and gloom mentality and a predilection for exaggerating the savagery  intensity  and destructive result of viking raids there is no doubt however that there was significant financial loss to church institutions  additionally if you were a west saxon king of say  northumbria  mercia or east anglia  viking arrival would prove devasting to your personal wealth and holdings the kings of these three kingdoms tended to end up dead  exiled  replaced  or in subjugation to viking sea warlords in some cases the vikings themselves supplanted the former saxon rule and ruled as local kings themselves  guthrum s rule over east anglia after his surrender to king alfred of wessex at chippenham   in other cases puppet kings were emplaced  egbert northumbria   however  subjugation or control by vikings was economically bad for everyone  by many accounts the city of york actually thrived under viking control york did very well trading with existing viking trade networks  and had  whie under viking rule  access to silk from byzantium  and wine from the european continent york also developed some strong manufacturing  including metalwork  and successful mints york and london both enjoyed profitable coin making  minting silver coins for both viking rulers and saxon rulers  for some nobles  viking rule may even have been perceived as preferable to loyalty to their saxon king and continued bloody warfare and expensive tribute levies needed to bribe the viking invaders alfred the great seems to have been unelected by his own witan  noble council  in a viking backed coup just before his athelney period  877   justin pollard makes an excellent case for this in his book alfred the great  the man who made england if viking rule was economically devastating for the local populace it seems unlikely that those of alfred s nobles who were disloyal to him would have been willing to trade their own king for guthrum the must have percived it as a trade up  economically and personally under alfred s rule their levies were being called in to fight  and before eddington generally alfred s battles were not great victories  and alfred was also reaching deep into his noblemen  and clergy s  coffers to pay the punitively expensive tribute the vikings were demanding  in summary  viking rule would affect you economically in different ways depending on who you are and what your current stake in the status quo was it was unquestionably harmful to many church institutions and the current ruling elite  but it could be very economically beneficial to submit to viking rule  especially as was seen in york and to a lesser extent london  my sources are written for laypeople  not academics but i believe they are well researched and considered accurate i welcome correction or criticism on these sources form the real historians  sources  viking age  everyday life during the extraordinary era of the norsemen  kirsten wolf the viking wars of alfred the great  paul hill alfred the great  the man who made england  justin pollard,d02akmx,askhistorians,learning,1455653700.0,faintpremonition,5.0,0.0,126,14200,0.0

 this interactive from the  new york times    http  wwwnytimescominteractive20140708upshothowtheyearyouwereborninfluencesyourpoliticshtml  _r  0  shows you very clearly how people have voted in terms of us presidential elections by birth cohort confusingly  it shows voter s simulated preferences based on statistical models even before they re 18  which is slightly confusing at glancejust pay attention to what s going on around the 20 year line an important note is that this model is for americanborn  white people only as you can see  most cohorts do in general have a higher tendency of voting republican when in middle age and beyond  but that also complex things happen this particular model  and this is statistical inference  not exactly how people expressed preferences in surveys  argues that most people s preferences are most malleable between 1424  and that little that happens after age 40 affects how cohorts vote one of the more interesting things is that the cohort born roughly during the 1970 s has gotten slightly but consistently  less  likely to vote republican as they age these people came of age during a period where republicans were triumphant  and chilled a little over time you can see a slightly similar things in the 1940 s  for people who came of age in the eisenhower era  set the dial to  say  1974 and notice that this cohort of white americans is less likely to vote republican today than they were when they came of age in 1992 it s a hard chart to see the ideological splits by age at any particular point in time  since they are comparing people by at specific ages rather by election   but it shows you how cohorts can change over time what it does nt show you is how much recent voting have been effected by demographic changes  such that bush in 2000 was able to beat al gore among white people 55  to 42   but only barely win the election compare that to the last close election without a strong third party candidate  ross perot  you make discussing presidential voting trends more difficult   the 1976 election  where carter won 50  to 48   and ford won white people only 52  to 48   hispanics and blacks went very strongly for carter  there were just many fewer hispanics voting in 1976  hispanics made up 1  of voters and blacks made up 9   in 2000  hispanics made up 7  of voters  blacks made up 10   and asians made up 2   i know you re not asking about age  not race  but i feel like it s important for understanding the above model which is only based on white voters  otherwise the numbers would nt seem to add up  as a note to this note  bush also did particularly well with hispanic voters  compared to other recent republican candidates  getting close to 40  of the vote in a threeman race in 1996  73  of hispanics voted for clinton   if you look at the roper center data  an easy way to look at voting in each election by age group    you see that 1824 were more likely to vote for reagan than 2529 or 3049 year olds   http  ropercentercornelledupollsuselectionshowgroupsvotedhowgroupsvoted1984   though just as likely as 5064 year olds and less likely than people 65 according to the above theory  they came of age during reagan s tremendously popular presidency and so were permanently effected by his high approval ratings  but the effect dissipated slightly over time you see little peaks and valleys like thatdukkakis and clinton were most popular with the young  and  very old  for example  perhaps in part due to old southerners continuing to vote democrat as younger cohorts moved more fully into the republican foldif so  this would be a measure of partisanship rather than ideologybut i am not sure exactly what explains that   with a distinct dip in support among the 4559 year olds  but yes  for the modern polling era  in america  at the presidential level  the general trend is that the young as a whole vote to the left of the old as a whole  even if there are fluctuations within the subgroups whether you want to say the polling era began in the 1960 s or the 1970 s or even in the 1950 s  gallup proved the success of telephone polling using random digit dialing in the 1948  dewey defeats truman  election  but i do nt think they collected or at least released subgroup data for that election   in the second half 20th century we start to get good data about how subgroups of the population vote before that period  i m not sure it would be easy to tell which way the youth as a whole were voting  though we could see which movements had more youth activists  which is likely a decent proxy  though harder to collect and interpret than already published poll results ,d0136qi,askhistorians,learning,1455570835.0,yodatsracist,481.0,0.0,14317,77599,1.0

yes  the  chlamys  was worn by the romans  although in a manner different than the greek images provided by uiphikrates the roman  chlamys  was a sleeveless  anklelength cloak made from a singular piece of semicircular cloth it was worn over a patterned tunic  often referred to as a coptic tunic  as whole tunics have been preserved by the egyptian desert   and was fastened at the right shoulder with a crossbowshaped broach attached to the vertical edges were a pair of  tablia   square or rectangular patches of colored or patterned cloth the famous  mosaic of justinian   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons666meister_von_san_vitale_in_ravenna_003jpg  at san vitale in ravenna depicts the emperor and his senior officials wearing the  chlamys  costume the  chlamys  was originally a military cloak  and entered civilian fashion sometime during the late thirdearly fourth centuries ad as part of a broader pattern of military styles shaping civilian dress over the course of the fourth century  the  chlamys  and it  s associated garments   coptic  tunic  footed hose  open faced  campagi  shoes  military belt  became the characteristic attire of military and civilian elites in late antiquity in late roman officialdom  the color and patterning of one  s tunic  trousers  and  chlamys  denoted department and rank  and were thus critical markers of status ,d01whji,askhistorians,learning,1455633368.0,HatMaster12,2.0,0.0,1,3677,0.0
