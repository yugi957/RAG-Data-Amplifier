it depends on the case  each surgical procedure and each medical treatment in general is a special case  and the requirements evaluated for a patient suffering from some health disorder meet a criteria which is distinctive of the treatment  in most cases  that criteria used for some specific treatment has been changing throughout history  each criteria has been changed for better until today  and it will probably keep changing over time  sometimes a new research  for a specific treatment and a specific health disorder  proposes a small change on the criteria used to say if a patient should or should not undergo that treatment ,d02fomc,askscience,learning,1455660474.0,Dimakhaerus,1.0,0.0,335,933,0.0

if we assume that each shuffle is  perfect  in that each shuffle is just a randomly chosen permutation of the cards form the 52   8 x 10   67  possible permutations  then your question is exactly the same as the birthday problem  but with 52   days  instead of 365 days let p  nd  be the probability of there being at least one match among  n   people  in a year with  d   days   then if  n  is much smaller than  d   we have the approximation gt  p  nd   1  exp  n   2  2d  setting this equal to 05 and solving for  n  with  d   52  gives gt  n     d  log  4    1 x 10   34  so quite a lot of shuffles  having said all of that  when you physically shuffle a deck  you are not choosing a random permutation of cards for instance  people generally divide the deck into two roughly equal parts and then mix them together  roughly alternating cards from each smaller deck so a given card typically does not move more than a few positions from its current position in the deck of course  depending on your shuffling method  a card could possibly move many positions your question then has no general solution for one  we would need a lot more information on how exactly the cards are shuffled second  it is not immediately obvious whether every permutation of cards is achievable  let alone in a finite expected number of shuffles ,czzy5lr,askscience,learning,1455485735.0,Midtek,16.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

both light sources are thermally excited  and you can understand the difference if you can understand both the blackbody spectrum and kirchoff s law of thermal radiation these combine to produce the emission spectrum of any object  a perfect blackbody absorbs all radiation equally when you heat it  statistical mechanics along with the quantized energy of photons determines that it will emit radiation in a continuous blackbody spectrum this has a color that goes from  red to orange to white to bluishwhite   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons000blackbodycoloursverticalsvg  as the temperature increases  now  a blackbody is an ideal scenario most objects do nt absorb all frequencies this is especially true in gasses  where only a few transitions are allowed to understand the emission spectra of these materials  we need  kirchoff s law   https  enwikipediaorgwikikirchhoff  27s_law_of_thermal_radiation   if you know the absorption spectrum of your material  then the emission spectrum will just be the product of the blackbody curve and the absorption spectrum  this cartoon   http  wwwastrobasbg  petrovherter00_fileslec07_04jpg  sums it up nicely with distinct lines instead of a smooth curve  a hot gas can emit a color determined by both its temperature and the absorption spectrum  despite the fact that the blackbody curve is an approximation  most solids and plasmas emit with something close to a blackbody spectrum this is for a variety of subtle reasons a nearly transparent material might absorb weakly  so it will also emit a weakened version of the blackbody curve also  in a thick material the decreased absorption at some wavelengths is compensated by the increased transparency at that wavelength  light from deeper inside the solid can escape and smooth the blackbody spectrum out at the surface these two effects are easy to see with hot glass it glows with a near blackbody spectrum  but if it is thin enough you can still see through it and it will look less bright ,d01m3so,askscience,learning,1455601505.0,AugustusFink-nottle,4.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

well let s start from the beginning how does you body make energy from food  glucose does nt just magically turn into raw energy that your body can use instead  it is subjected to dozens of chemical reactions performed by enzymes in your body the enzymes are proteins honed over millions of years of evolution for perform basically a single reaction at speeds thousands or millions of times faster than would occur otherwise the pathway that turns glucose into atp  which is the main energy currency of your body is pretty complicated  but if you want a simple image just imagine a factory that takes in coal at one end  and runs a powerplant at the other there are special machines that first clean the coal  then sort the coal  then grade it  then crush it  then transport it  then dump into the furnace that is specially designed for sorted  graded  cleaned coal you could nt just dump a tree  or a container of natural gas in one end  and expect the factory to work  now your body has a lot of enzymes designed to deal with all sorts of compounds and lots of those compounds can end up being turned into atp  energy you body can use   fats and proteins obviously  but also other things  for instance ethanol but importantly  not everything lots of compounds your body has only rudimentary one size fits all  processes to deal with or some compounds  like water  are at the bottom of the energy ladder as far as your body is concerned this is why you ca nt drink petrol and hope to burn it for energy you body has no enzymes to convert it to atp so zero calorie energy drunks have no  or very few  compounds that your body can convert to energy they have no sugar  no protein  no fats just caffeine and water and artificial sweetener  the other thing that i realize now that is throwing you off is the word  energy   energy drinks are so called because the claim to give you a feeling of energy  this is due to caffeine  and perhaps sugar in the nondiet ones   they are not claiming that they supply your body with biologically relevant energy sources  they are claiming they will give you a feeling of energy due to the caffeine ,d02gqwp,askscience,learning,1455661966.0,NeuroBill,9.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

 generating it  could mean many things let s break the question into a few smaller bits     1  can we be sure we know the genetic sequence    we can be pretty confident  but there is a snag when it comes to repeated regions sequencing costs have come down enormously over the past decade  but current techniques rely on sequencing many randomly generated short segments and then using a computer to identify where they overlap to build the genome sequence eukaryotic genomes often have long regions of repeated dna  so if the short segments of dna you sequence are shorter than the length of the repeated region  you will never know how many repeats the original genome had on top of this  the genome is nt quite fixed between cells of one organism  with small alterations building up between the stem cells in different regions as you age these problems are less of a concern in bacteria  but they might pose a larger challenge for making synthetic multicellular life     2  can we generate the genetic sequence synthetically    yes we can only directly synthesize a few hundred bases before errors start to become very common but thanks to tricks like  gibson assembly   https  enwikipediaorgwikigibson_assembly   we can make those short synthetic dna bits assemble into longer sequences again  there is a challenge when it comes to long stretches of repetitive dna  because the reassembled dna might skip a repeated section and these regions can shorten easily during pcr amplification  but these are technical challenges that moneytime can overcome     3  can we put the synthetic genome inside a preexisting cell and make it work    this is at the edge of our abilities now more than 10 years ago viable polio virus was created from  synthetic dna   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent29755831016long   other commenters mentioned the success of  gibson et al   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent329598752  in generating viable bacteria using synthetic dna but doing this with other species will be trickier dna in multicellular organisms needs to have much more epigenetic regulation than in singlecelled organisms that is because your neurons  skin cells  muscle cells  etc all have  very nearly  the exact same dna in them the epigenetic differences are what differentiates those cells from each other large portions of the genome have to be silenced in a viable cell  and different regions are silenced in different cells this silencing is accomplished through many different mechanisms working at the same time  and there is much we do nt understand even taking existing differentiated cells and and turning them back into stem cells  called  induced pluripotent stem cells   https  enwikipediaorgwikiinduced_pluripotent_stem_cell   is very difficult getting a full  sequence  of all the epigenetic features of a cell line is beyond our current abilities right now if we just tried to exchange a synthetic genome of naked dna into  say  mouse cells  the cells would be reading all the wrong bits of dna at once     4  can we synthesize the rest of the cell    as in  how far away are we from generating life from direct synthesis of not just dna  but the proteins  membranes  etc  this is far  far beyond what we can do cells are extremely efficient factories for generating complex molecules and assembling them into larger functioning units and we do nt even know everything that is in a cell this would be like asking a child with a lego set to build a tesla    tldr   some simple life forms can be generated from synthetic dna right now  but for multicellular organisms this will be much harder ,d00do37,askscience,learning,1455514917.0,AugustusFink-nottle,45.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

 nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ,d02hlps,askscience,learning,1455663201.0,NeuroBill,1.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

the sensor that these lenses project their image on is rectangular it s possible to construct a circular sensor and obtain circular pictures  but people tend to prefer rectangular pictures  on the other hand  producing rectangular lenses is more difficult than producing circular ones  so we end up with circular lenses that project an circular image that is larger than the sensor  while the rectangular sensor registers the central part of the image  you can see the effect of the lenses being circular in the image  to some extent a phenomenon called vignetting causes the image to darken as you move away from the center when taking a picture of a uniform background  you can see the corners of the image being slightly darker than the center  the strength of this effect depends on the quality of the lens and the apareture setting used  ,d01z5nx,askscience,learning,1455637913.0,Rannasha,12.0,0.0,821,19067,0.0
this is because of the difference in the heat of moist air vs dry air  the equator receives the most sunlight of any area on earth quite a bit of this solar heating goes into evaporation of water  rather than raising the temperature itself  so the equator itself is a bit cooler than if the earth were bone dry  all this evaporation creates warm  moist air over the equatorial oceans  which begin rising and forming clouds this warm air deposits almost all of its moisture in clouds at equatorial regions  but the air itself continues rising that same air  now very dry  then begins to head in the direction of the poles  but is halted in its journey around  30 degrees latitude  the socalled  horse latitudes   as the coriolis force prevents it from moving more poleward it then proceeds to descend as very dry air around those same latitudes  eventually looping back closer to the surface to the equator  now all this dry descending air around the horse latitudes leads to a vast area of deserts at those locations in the northern hemisphere  there s the american southwest  the sahara  and the middle east in the southern hemisphere  there s the atacama desert in chile  the kalahari desert in namibia  and the australian outback obviously not everywhere at these latitudes is desert  since local currents can affect the area s climate  but deserts are the general trend  so why is it hotter there  it turns out that compressing dry air as it descends from high altitudes over these deserts will raise the temperature quite a bit more than the temperature decreased as it rose over the moist equator decompressing moist air in general  moist air changes temperature about 6 degrees c per km  while dry air changes about 10 degrees c per km this is because moist air recoups some of the heat lost to the original evaporation when that water vapor condenses as clouds as latest heat  so we start at 30 c over the equator and lift up the moist air to 3 km where clouds are formed  losing moisture as clouds  and the nowdry air is at 12 c the dry air then continues upwards up to about 10 km  where the additional 7 km of height decrease the temperature down to 58 c it travels poleward  when it then descends the 10 km as dry air over the horse latitudes  where it s now heated to 42 c  hotter than it originally was at the equator ,czzs2f8,askscience,learning,1455475284.0,Astromike23,66.0,0.0,975,48236,1.0

the words  perpendicular    orthogonal  and  normal  all essentially mean  meeting at right angles    unfortunately  the term  normal  itself means several different  unrelated things  depending on the context  generally  you can interchange all three terms and no one will care however  there are actually subtle differences between the terms or  at the very least  cases where one term is used predominantly over the others   we say that two vectors  arrows  or lines are perpendicular if they meet each other  intersect each other  at right angles the term  perpendicular  is generally used only for this geometrical concept  and usually only when referring to perpendicular lines or vectors   a collection of vectors  elements of an abstract inner product space  are orthogonal if their inner product is zero when the inner product space is r   n  with the usual euclidean inner product  this is the same as  perpendicular   almost two lines can have orthogonal direction vectors  yet not be perpendicular themselves  eg  the lines do nt intersect   if the inner product space is not r   n   then there really is no geometrical counterpart to orthogonality for instance  the functions sin  x  and cos  x  are orthogonal in l   2    0  2pi    note also that we can speak of  orthogonal collections  of vectors  but we usually do nt say  perpendicular collections    if a vector meets a surface at right angles  then we say that the vector is normal to the surface we could just say that they are perpendicular  but there is a certain assymetry in this case since one of the objects is a surface  ie  not a line or other vector   so we use a different term  which is  normal   again  no one will really think twice if you talk about two vectors in some abstract vector space being normal or a vector being perpendicular to a surface or two lines being orthogonal it s just that in each of those cases  we tend to use different terms if you had to choose one term as a safe catchall  i would go with  orthogonal   in any case where you can use any of these three terms   orthogonal  pretty much never sounds awkward  unlike the other two ,d006cxt,askscience,learning,1455500544.0,Midtek,31.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

the magic of bonding to enamel is because of a process called  acid etching   http  wwwslidesharenetmahmoudmohsinacidetchingofenamelandbondstrength   not because there is anything special in the adhesive used slide  5 of this presentation shows a microscopic view of enamel following treatment with an acid etch the material inside these tiny tubules is dissolved by the acid which then allows the composite adhesive to flow into these irregularities the adhesive is formulated with a light curing initiator so that when a certain spectrum of blue light hits the composite  the liquid adhesive becomes hard so basically the bond of the adhesive to the enamel is a mechanical lock the bracket also has a rough surface that allows for a mechanical lock  this same  bonding process   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  q_fhmesa2rcis  used by dentists to adhere fillings and porcelain veneers for bonding orthodontic brackets you apply a small dab of acid etch gel  usually colored blue  to the center of the tooth for about 1530 seconds and then you rinse it off dry the enamel then has a chalky appearance that is different from the shiny appearance of unetched enamel you apply the liquid adhesive and hold a curing light  blue spectrum  over the area and the liquid instantly cures and becomes hard  if after the etching process  the enamel is contaminated with saliva  salivary proteins will flow into some of those tubules and create a weak bond you know a bond was contaminated when you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off and you see no adhesive stuck on the tooth and it s all on the bracket other times  you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off with most of the adhesive on the tooth and none on the bracket and this is because the patient chewed ice or something else hard that exceeded the tensile strength of the adhesive  when braces need to be removed  there are special tools that grab the bracket and cleave the mechanical bond  which usually leaves a blob of composite on the enamel  but sometimes leaves a blob of composite attached to the bracket the blob of composite on the enamel is then removed with sharp chisel like instruments and smoothed with very fine burs  i had a patient in braces one time and they just disappeared we could nt get hold of her and did nt see her for two years we finally located her and realized that she had removed the braces herself  she also dropped out of school and had a baby  with pliers fortunately she did nt damage the enamel anywhere and she was able to get the brackets off  but each tooth had a blob of rough composite in the center which i then smoothed away ,d01t4pv,askscience,learning,1455625161.0,veritasius,38.0,0.0,3222,6487,0.0

you certainly can see lasers with the naked eye  it s just very dangerous to look at them directly  because they can damage your retina irreparably  you need to think about the light coming out of a laser like a stream of bullets from a rifle they go completely straight  and once properly focused form a tight beam lasers can be made so that the diameter of the beam does nt change by more than fractions of an inch over miles of distance  just like you can stand off target from a rifle and not be hit by a bullet  you can stand beside a laser and not see the beam the photons have to hit your pupil for you to see the laser  assuming the laser is emitting visible light   normal light sources are like shot guns in comparison  the light flings out in all directions  though again  the can be focused  though not as well generally speaking   but again  you can only see the light if photons from that source hit your pupil and are focused onto your retina  so why can you see a laser when it goes through a mist  well to extend out rifle analogy  this is akin to firing the rifle into a concrete wall  and you get ricochets  which now might hit you anywhere when the laser photons hits the particles of mist they are refracted around  bending this way and that  each little droplet of mist is a little prism  and some of them get bent around until they fly into your eye  and then you can see them this is also why you can see lasers in dusty rooms  the little particles of dust are also prisms   you can change the colour of the laser light by the process of fluorescence here the fluorescent molecule absorbs light at one wavelength  but emits it at a very different wavelength this is not restricted to laser light this is what happens to your tshirt under  black light  aka uv light there are chemicals in the tshirt that absorb the uv light and emit light at a variety of wavelengths  appearing white ,d02i4yv,askscience,learning,1455663997.0,NeuroBill,5.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

dopamine in particular is a neurotransmitter  it s a chemical message that neurons send to each other when they make computations happiness  as with all of your experiences  is a computation in your brain  your brain is integrating a bunch of inputs and saying that those inputs are good  and you experience this as happiness since happiness is just computation  and computation requires neurotransmission  happiness also requires neurotransmission  not all neurotransmitters are interchangeable some neurotransmitters send one message  some send another  and some send different messages based on the context of their transmission in addition  different neurons have different preferences for different neurotransmitters put all this together and you end up finding that some neurotransmitters are associated with particular kinds of computation  and in this way dopamine is associated with happiness  so it s not that dopamine makes you happy  it s that dopamine is an essential part of what happiness actually is  as a physical process in the brain ,czzda4z,askscience,learning,1455435642.0,Yoshanuikabundi,17.0,0.0,182,3575,0.0

i m not entirely sure exactly the situation you are talking about so i ll give a few answers  if you mean something like the moon  there are a few reasons first  it s very far away so for something that far away to move quickly across the eye  it would have to either be moving much much faster that s just a function of geometry however  there is an additional reason which is that we are better at perceiving relative velocity  how one object moves in relation to another  rather than absolute velocity so forgetting about the size of the object in the real world  if you just had a light that projected to the same area of your retina  same retinal size   then you would be worse at detecting its motion than if you had a second light on nearby as well by worse at detecting its motion  i mean that it would have to be moving faster before you would perceive it as moving than for the case where there are two objects i should also note that relative motion can be relative to a textured background  not necessarily relative to a second object  in general  it really is the case that larger objects  or several fragments grouped into a perceptual whole  are perceived to have a slower velocity than smaller or multiple objects  verghese and stone  1995   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepii0042698995000382    1996   http  visionarcnasagovpersonnelleepublicationsperceived_visual_speed_conpdf    1997   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis0042698996001551    verghese and stone suggest that this is a function of scene segmentation this may also be due to motion pooling mechanisms your receptors at the level of the retina and in early visual cortex have relatively small receptive fields  they are detecting changes in contrast over time over a very small area of space subsequent visual areas  hmt  have to then pool that information to get a global motion percept cells in these areas have much larger receptive fields it is possible that there is some attenuation in the motion pooling  edit  a word,d011xd7,askscience,learning,1455569030.0,albasri,3.0,0.0,337,10662,1.0

gt  why could the explanation not be that the universal lengthscale just is not constant or something along the lines  one thing to keep in mind  einstein derived general relativity by thinking about the consequences of gravity and acceleration behaving equivalently from this key insight  he was able to outline field equations that determine how mass  pressure  and energy warp spacetime to produce what we perceive as a gravitational force around a planet or star but those same equations also can determine the possible shapes of the entire universe and how it expands with time dark energy was in those equations from the start  in the form of a cosmological constant whose value could only be determined by by fitting to observations  what is amazing is that a theory that was developed to reconcile the different points of view of observers near planets and stars turned out to also fit the data that would later be collected showing an expanding universe it fits that data pretty well with a cosmological constant that was zero when we finally got more accurate redshift measurements from very distant objects in the 90 s  it was clear that a nonzero cosmological constant was needed  so when dark energy gets explained in the popular press  it often sounds like a cludge inserted into the models of the universe to make them work but given that the cosmological constant was there in the field equations all along  it is actually should make you more confident that general relativity correctly describes the universe on these scales an alternate explanation that something else like a  universal length scale  is affecting the universe to make it accelerate would mean we would need to develop an alternative to general relativity that would be a little premature given that this theory can explain every measurable effect of gravity so far  on scales ranging from a falling apple to the observable universe ,d01qw33,askscience,learning,1455616333.0,AugustusFink-nottle,6.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

from einstein s equivalence principle  which existed in more primitive forms even in newton s work   the only physical difference between being in a constant gravitational field and being in an accelerated frame is tidal forces  which are generally defined as any difference in gravitational force over distance if you re on the surface of the earth  you never feel any tidal forces on your body  nor can you measure any change in the gravitational field in a decent vicinity of your position but already if you check out the period of a pendulum at different altitudes  you start to notice that the gravitational force the earth depends on where you are  this was noticed before newton   and if you want to work out planetary orbits you definitely need to include how force varies like 1r   2   so if everything you re considering allows you to set g  98 ms  2 everywhere  then gravity is equivalent to acceleration  but this breaks down as gravity varies with position ,d01ntey,askscience,learning,1455605705.0,mofo69extreme,6.0,0.0,72,8830,0.0

it is rather difficult for me not to give an advanced answer to your question the best intuition i can give is the following  suppose the spatial universe had positive curvature  instead of zero curvature  which is a flat universe   the prototypical example of a surface of positive curvature everywhere is a sphere the positive curvature means that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always more than 180 degrees  for instance if a space has positive curvature  it has to curve back in on itself to create that  convex  shape of the sphere so the space ends up having to  close up   which means it ends up being finite  there is a general mathematical theorem that states that any complete  riemannian manifold with positive  boundedbelow curvature must be compact it s not an easy theorem  if the curvature is zero everywhere  then the space can just spread out and does nt have to close in on itself so if it never closes up  it just goes on forever  and the space is infinite   the problem with this intuitive picture is that it s a bit wrong the part about a positive curvature space having to be finite is true the part about a zero curvature space having to be infinite is not true a zero curvature space  can  be infinite  but it can also do some odd things like repeat itself  while maintaining the flatness so this just begs the question why then must a flat universe be infinite     edit    to match the edit below it turns out that if space is flat  and  finite  then it must not be isotropic  which means that it does nt look the same in all directions but that statement is mathematically highly nontrivial  to answer that  i have to resort to some more advanced math    warning   some technical and mathematical language ahead someone else might come along to give a more accessible explanation of why flat   gt  infinite until then  requests for clarification are welcome   in the robertstonwalker cosmology  there are three possibilities for the  constant  spatial curvature  the curvature of hypersurfaces of constant cosmological time   determined by the sign of the curvature  positive  zero  or negative   3spaces of constant zero curvature  ie  a flat universe  come in essentially two types   e   3   which is just euclidean space this is a noncompact manifold   s   1  x s   1  x s   1   or the 3torus this is a periodic  compact manifold in this type of universe  you can head out in some direction and eventually come back to your exact starting point the spatial universe is finite  each of these spaces could  in principle  be the topology of the  spatial  universe but we usually rule out the 3torus either because it is periodic or because it is not simply connected  off the top of my head  i can not think of any feasible experimental way to rule out a nonsimplyconnected universe though     edit    oops  forgot to mention that the 3torus is also not  isotropic   which more or less means that space should look the same in all directions  so all that is left is e   3  if the universe is flat  whence the universe must also be infinite   there are  other  3spaces of constant zero curvature for instance  s   1  x k  where k is a klein bottle however  all other spaces that i did not list above are  nonorientable   which then must necessarily also be nonsimplyconnected   so if we do nt rule out a topology for not being simply connected  we would almost certainly rule it out for not being orientable a nonorientable space seems rather nonphysical  it turns out though that there are other deeper reasons to rule out spacetimes that are not spaceorientable it is believed that all interactions are invariant under simultaneous reversal of charge  parity  and time  cptinvariance    a formal statement of the theorem can be proved under some natural conditions  since weak interactions are not cpinvariant  it follows that in going around a closed curve in spacetime  either the sign of charge  the orientation of spacelike axes  and the orientation of time must all reverse  or none of them reverse  which follows from cptinvariance   hence a spacetime is timeorientable if and only if it is also spaceorientable  the question of spaceorientability then becomes one of timeorientability there are examples of spacetimes that are not timeorientable  but the idea of time nonorientability seems even less natural than that of space nonorientability  interestingly  if a spacetime is not timeorientable  it has a double covering space which  is  timeorientable  a spacetime that is not timeorientable presents the same sort of problems that closed timelike curves present  ie  time travel  because there would be closed curves that reverse the time orientation  and so would be able to reinterpret certain events as having occurred in the reverse order you end up getting the same sort of grandfather paradoxes that you hear about when time travel is brought up so we have  very strong  reasons to believe that our universe is timeorientable  which then means  by cptinvariance  that the universe is also spaceorientable ,d00bep2,askscience,learning,1455509918.0,Midtek,65.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0
it s a little hard to answer because i do nt know how much you know about electricity and electronics  but we re going to start from the basics  first thing is  you need to understand the concepts of voltage and current in order to understand them  we re going to use the fluid analogy imagine a circuit of tubes  filled with water  and a pump driving the water around and around the pump provides pressure  which drives a flow of liquid against the resistance of the the pipes this is equivalent to a voltage source  providing voltage  to drive current against a resistance big voltages make more current flow against the same resistance or a bigger resistance makes less current flow at the same voltage this gives rise to ohm s law v  ir  voltage  currentresistance  we can continue to extend our analog inductors are like a water wheel in our flow if we initially have our pump stopped  and turn it on  all the pressure will build up behind the water wheel  which will eventually starting to get it turning once the water wheel is turning at the speed that the current would flow if the water wheel was nt there  then the water wheel provides no resistance at all moreover  if we try to stop or pump suddenly  the water wheel will keep spinning  because of its inertia   and try to force water through our tubes  making a massive pressure in the pipe  because the pump is off   this is what inductors do when you turn the voltage on and try to drive current through them  the provide a lot of resistance  but once the current is flowing through them  the provide very little resistance but if you try to stop the current flowing suddenly  they can make massive voltages to attempt to keep the current flowing  how do inductors do this  by producing and storing magnetic fields all conductors produce a magnetic field when current flows down them similarly  a  changing  magnetic field around a conductor produces current inductors are coils of wire designed to take advantage of these facts being made as a coil of wire  each wire s magnetic field interacts with every other wire when you try to start pushing current through  the magnetic fields starts to grow  and it tries to push current in the other direction  which makes it hard to start the current through the inductor however  once the current is stable  the magnetic field no longer changes  and hence it no longer tries to induce current in the opposite direction when you try to stop current flow instantly  the large magnetic field is there and it starts to collapse  change   which then tries to drive the current through the inductor note  the magnetic field is growing to begin with  which induces a current opposing the current flow  the magnetic field is collapsing at the end  which produces current in the direction that it was being driven in the first place  and why do we use them  1  because you can see they behave differently when the current is constant  no resistance  ie the spinning water wheel  no changing magnetic field  to when the current is changing  changing magnetic field produces opposing currents   they are used in filters ie currents behaving at certain frequencies can be gotten rid of by inductors 2  changing voltages the ability for inductors to make big voltages when you try to turn them off rapidly is used to make simple voltage converters you put a low voltage into an inductor  switch it off  then store the large voltage spike you get  and use a diode to stop it leaking away this voltage converter is called a boost converter  and it is very common 3  inductors turn up by accident basically all electromechanical devices  motors  solenoids  relays behave as inductors because they have coils of wire transformers also behave as inductors  though it s less by accident there   so electrical engineers need to know how inductors behave because they can produce nasty effects if you do nt think about it  that effect where if you try to stop the current going through an inductor and it produces big voltages is very real  and will damage things if you do nt protect the circuit against it   so  to sum up inductors are circuit elements that are hard to get current to flow through initially  but try to keep the current flowing there after they work by creating a magnetic field  which stores the energy and tries to induce currents we use them as filters and voltage producers and they also turn up by accident ,d01eb6v,askscience,learning,1455588124.0,NeuroBill,3.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

no  we currently do nt know of any fixed upper limit for the size of a black hole there are some practical limitations though for example  most supermassive black holes grow by feeding on a bright disk of gas  called the accretion disk  as shown here   http  wwwphysicsoftheuniversecomimagesblackholes_accretionjpg   basically what happens is that matter floating around the black hole ends up orbiting the black hole in this disk  bits of matter bang into each other heating up the gas  hence why it s bright   the friction from this process slows down the gas  which eventually allows it to fall into the event horizon of the black hole  however  recent papers have suggested that there may be a limit to the size of the black hole where it can still grow by eating up its accretion disk for example   this paper   http  arxivorgpdf151108502v2pdf  suggests that when the black hole reaches a critical mass  mc   the disk will be so massive that it will be able to clump up into stars and other large chunks of matter that will simply orbit the black hole instead of falling in however this critical mass is insanely large at about 50 billion solar masses  moreover  even this size is not an absolute limit these black holes can continue to increase in ways that do nt require an accretion disk  eg by eating up another black hole ,d01zmdo,askscience,learning,1455638622.0,crnaruka,324.0,0.0,16106,98856,1.0

there are two answers to this question   1  a charged black hole  no spin  has 2 characteristic length scales  r  _s_   the schwarzschild radius  and r  _q_   no special name afaik   the black hole itself has two horizons  an outer event horizon and an inner socalled cauchy horizon if you cross the outer event horizon  you are doomed to keep falling inward toward the inner cauchy horizon  and then cross it into a region where you are then free to move around again as usual this region is very strange though it contains ctc s  closed timelike curves  and you can approach the singularity at the center as close as you want and then move away you can even then cross back through the cauchy horizon  after which you are doomed to keep falling outward  cross the event horizon  and then emerge in a topologically equivalent universe  not the same one though   it s a strange metric to say the least  if the charge of the black hole is large enough  the two horizons coincide  and if the charge is even larger than that  there are no horizons  this occurs when 2r  _q_  gt  r  _s_    the singularity at the center is naked  you can approach as close as you want  poke it with a stick  leave  and report your findings to someone else the black hole is said to be superextremal  if you work out r  _q_  and r  _s_  for an electron  treating it as a black hole  you find that the electron would have to be superextremal in other words  the electron  if it were a charged  nonspinning black hole  would be a naked singularity there are some discussions in the literature about what a  black hole electron  would mean  and i think there is even a wikipedia page on it afaik  a black hole electron is consistent with gr and qft part of the problem of verifying such a claim is that the value of r  _q_  is like 10   37  m and r  _s_  is like 10   57  m both length scales are orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length so a full quantum theory of gravity would be necessary to describe the black hole electron  there is also no practical way of probing lengths that small   2  the simpler answer is really that although two black holes can supposedly be distinguished only by m  mass   j  spin   and q  charge   that does nt mean that any two objects with the same value of m  j  and q are indistinguishable all this means is that  if  we know both objects are black holes  then m  j  and q suffice as a characterization if the objects are not black holes  then we should not expect that to be enough ,d02fme8,askscience,learning,1455660386.0,Midtek,11.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0
one major issue that comes up if you consider 4 spatial dimensions is that gravity varies with the cube of the distance from the attractor  and as a nontrivial consequence  there are no stable orbits  in 3d  orbits around stars are relatively stable  a minor perturbation does nt grow each rotation but smooths out in 4d the opposite is the case any orbit would be like a ball balanced on a pyramid  stable only until an external force acts  then it s a runaway ,d02t5rw,askscience,learning,1455681272.0,sirgog,1.0,0.0,94,25604,0.0

yes  definitely the idea that the universe is expanding is not a metaphor  but is a very real physical process the distance between faraway clumps of the universe really is getting larger with time  for example  we define the observable universe by the furthest objects we could observe because their light would have had time to reach us considering that the universe is about 14 billion years old  in a static universe that would come out to a distance of 14 billion light years but in reality when the light we now receive was emitted  the sources must have been much closer to us than 14 billion light years  but it took so long to reach us because the distance it had to cross was continuously increasing as the light was traveling  if you like a more visual explanation  take a look at  this diagram   http  iimgurcom3pj1xlepng   which captures the same idea   source   https  dournacorginfolight_geodesics   edit  added the figure and fixed some units,d01y5tl,askscience,learning,1455636324.0,crnaruka,761.0,0.0,16106,98856,1.0

 this graph from the article   https  wwwphysicsforumscominsightswpcontentuploads201601premgravpng   along with the commentary  is the relevant bit  you are absolutely correct that it s not simple as you  dig  down you re getting closer to the middle  but you start leaving mass behind you  which pulls in the opposite direction the key here is that you have to realize how earth s mass is distributed  the dark red line shows that the earth gets more dense as you  dig  deeper at the very center of the earth the density looks to be about 13000 kgm   there s a small jump when transitioning from inner core to outer core and then a very large jump when transitioning from the outer core to the mantle it gets less and less dense as you move higher into the mantle and then into the crust  the interesting point here is that a lot of the earth s mass is concentrated in the core so as you get closer to the core  your distance to the bulk of earth s mass decreases and the force of gravity increases the increase is not the same as if all of earth s mass were located at a single point in the center and you re moving closer to that point you re correct about this it s just that there s so much mass in the core that it overrules the losses does that make sense  so the overall trend as you dig down from the crust is that gravity  the black line  gets greater as you move towards the core  moving right to left   once you pass into the core  gravity drops off significantly  as you would expect  because most of the mass is nt in one direction any more  until it s zero at the very center  the origin of the graph  ,d029bqe,askscience,learning,1455652024.0,jofwu,1.0,0.0,1213,21889,0.0

it depends on what you mean by  generate   but  genetic sequences don  t create cells from nothing a genome is housed in a cell  and it got there from another genome that was housed inside a parental cell  and so on  going all the way back billions of years to the origin of cellular life if you want to  generate  the organism from scratch  it  s not a question of pure information  you have to provide the genetic sequence with a very particular environment  that in nature would have simply been inherited from a progenitor cell so it  s a physical problem of making and then putting thousands of different components together in very complex ways  and to do that  you  d need incredibly advanced biomolecular technology  you also need additional information about the physical and informational structure of the organism that is not contained in the genetic sequence  look into  epigenetics   https  enwikipediaorgwikiepigenome   depending on the complexity of the cell you want to make  generation from scratch might involve synthesizing lots of different organelles  different kinds of membranes  a microtubule framework  a cytoplasm with just the right chemical makeup  and putting all these things together in exactly the right way so the genetic sequence can operate correctly in the cell you  ve made for it that is something far beyond our abilities at present  and this is only considering single cells with multicellular organisms you  d face a whole host of problems relating to embryogenesis and development if you think about your genetic sequence  it didn  t allow you to come into being fully formed  in an arbitrary environment you started from a single cell in which your genome was configured epigenetically in a very specific way your subsequent development completely depended on being attached to a placenta inside your mother so no  just knowing your genetic sequence doesn  t allow you to be generated in a lab somewhere  with very simple organisms like bacteria  you can sometimes get away with substituting one genome for a quite different one  and the new instructions will still function with the foreign cellular  machinery   there  s been a lot of work in this area  perhaps the most high profile being craig venter  s  life 20  project  although it really falls under the heading of  partially synthetic organism  rather than  generating life from scratch  ,d007ls0,askscience,learning,1455502868.0,pluteoid,22.0,0.0,216,780,0.0

there s a lot of eye problems that can develop as we age but i think what you re referring to in particular is that older individuals are unable to focus up close  and thus need reading glasses this is not due to muscle fatigue  the ciliary muscles contract appropriately  loosening the suspensory ligaments  hold on the lens  but the lens loses the ability to  round up  as we age  and thus is unable to focus the light reflecting off close objects to the macula as it should we call the lens  loss of elasticity presbyopia  amp  nbsp  tl  dr the lens becomes less elastic as we age  making it harder to see up close ,d02h3oo,askscience,learning,1455662480.0,donthequail,2.0,0.0,4,1374,0.0

from einstein s equivalence principle  which existed in more primitive forms even in newton s work   the only physical difference between being in a constant gravitational field and being in an accelerated frame is tidal forces  which are generally defined as any difference in gravitational force over distance if you re on the surface of the earth  you never feel any tidal forces on your body  nor can you measure any change in the gravitational field in a decent vicinity of your position but already if you check out the period of a pendulum at different altitudes  you start to notice that the gravitational force the earth depends on where you are  this was noticed before newton   and if you want to work out planetary orbits you definitely need to include how force varies like 1r   2   so if everything you re considering allows you to set g  98 ms  2 everywhere  then gravity is equivalent to acceleration  but this breaks down as gravity varies with position ,d01ntey,askscience,learning,1455605705.0,mofo69extreme,6.0,0.0,72,8830,0.0

depends on what you mean by  realistic   there are experiments one could do to tell the difference  but you would nt be able to do them without the equipment for them   in particular  under earth s gravity two things falling in different spots do not fall parallel to each other  whereas under linear acceleration they would it s a small effect though  to put it mildly also  there is the direct change in gravity with height ,d01yyni,askscience,learning,1455637617.0,NotInVan,0.0,0.0,1,855,0.0

there are a few ways this is achieved a method commonly applied in biology  hence one i am familiar with  is screening strains with random mutations  let s say enzymes a and b are involved in the synthetic pathway of x  but that we do nt know this yet we then generate thousands of mutants some of them will end up having defective a or b  which stops the production of x this allows the identification of enzymesgenes involved  and hence mapping of the synthetic pathway occasionally  but not always  you will detect the buildup of precursor molecules in these strains as well  while this is ongoing  we also find the chemical structure of compound x in biology  there are not too many many starting building blocks and catalytic mechanisms  so it is not impossible to guess how the compound would be made  for example  a lot of nitrogencontaining molecules involve amino acids  and many pathways involving aromatic rings are variations of tyrosine synthesis pathway  potential precursor molecules are identified and then tested on the enzymes a and b  either in vitro or in vivo  for validation  the metabolic pathways of ironchelating molecules called siderophores were discovered this way  with the end molecules identified first and then the pathway built upstream ,d01dixk,askscience,learning,1455586893.0,fush_n_chops,2.0,0.0,110,16650,0.0

i have a question about the double slit experiment in my understanding  the double slit experiment creates an interference pattern  since a particle can follow two different trajectories of different length  one for each of the slits therefore  it would take the particle a different amount of time to go through slit a compared to slit b  let s say that the trajectory through slit a takes 1 time unit  and the trajectory through slit b takes 12 time units if we close slit b  we will detect a particle after 1 time unit if we close slit a  we will detect a particle after 12 time units but what will happen if we open both slits  after how many time units will we detect the particle  if we  repeatedly  measure for the arrival of the particle after 1 time unit  will we still get a probability that corresponds to an interference pattern  even though the particle through slit b could nt have arrived yet  would nt that transfer information faster than light  bonus question  i understand the interference disappears when we observe through which slit the particle goes however  it is not clear to me what counts exactly as observation for example  if the particle is an electron  and there happens to be a proton near slit a  would this count as observation  what if we measure the change of velocity of this proton  what if we measure the change of velocity of this proton  but only after the electrons have arrived at the detector ,45u7t7,askscience,learning,1455501356.0,math1985,3.0,0.0,29,4501,0.0
i would have to think a bit more on this one  but what directly comes to mind it that you assume that the detection time is somehow deterministic in the standard double slit experiment  your incoming particles tend to have well defined momenta and have a lot of uncertainty on the position this uncertainty in the position makes it impossible to predict when the particle will be where this makes it hard to predict when exactly your particle will enter your slits  so my feeling is that you would actually have some randomness in your detection times things may get a bit more precise by using wave packets  but once you can start distinguishing your pathways by the time degree of freedom  you will probably not see interference fringes because the spatial extent of your wave packets may just be smaller than distance between the slits  such that any wave packet only sees one slit  long story short  i believe the uncertainty principle will forbid you from getting both this time resolution and the possibility of interference note  however  that you are not destroying the interference pattern by measuring arrival times  to be able to distinguish pathways by using arrival times  your experiment s parameters would have to be tuned in such a way that you would not have interference fringes even if you did not resolve the time  could be i am overlooking something  feel free to correct me ,d01eznr,askscience,learning,1455589181.0,awesomattia,3.0,0.0,1,484,0.0
both light sources are thermally excited  and you can understand the difference if you can understand both the blackbody spectrum and kirchoff s law of thermal radiation these combine to produce the emission spectrum of any object  a perfect blackbody absorbs all radiation equally when you heat it  statistical mechanics along with the quantized energy of photons determines that it will emit radiation in a continuous blackbody spectrum this has a color that goes from  red to orange to white to bluishwhite   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons000blackbodycoloursverticalsvg  as the temperature increases  now  a blackbody is an ideal scenario most objects do nt absorb all frequencies this is especially true in gasses  where only a few transitions are allowed to understand the emission spectra of these materials  we need  kirchoff s law   https  enwikipediaorgwikikirchhoff  27s_law_of_thermal_radiation   if you know the absorption spectrum of your material  then the emission spectrum will just be the product of the blackbody curve and the absorption spectrum  this cartoon   http  wwwastrobasbg  petrovherter00_fileslec07_04jpg  sums it up nicely with distinct lines instead of a smooth curve  a hot gas can emit a color determined by both its temperature and the absorption spectrum  despite the fact that the blackbody curve is an approximation  most solids and plasmas emit with something close to a blackbody spectrum this is for a variety of subtle reasons a nearly transparent material might absorb weakly  so it will also emit a weakened version of the blackbody curve also  in a thick material the decreased absorption at some wavelengths is compensated by the increased transparency at that wavelength  light from deeper inside the solid can escape and smooth the blackbody spectrum out at the surface these two effects are easy to see with hot glass it glows with a near blackbody spectrum  but if it is thin enough you can still see through it and it will look less bright ,d01m3so,askscience,learning,1455601505.0,AugustusFink-nottle,4.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

without sitting down and walking through all of solid state physics i ll just say there are essentially three cuplrits that add up to the total speed  fermi velocity  thermal velocity  drift velocity by far and away the biggest component of an electron in a metal s velocity is what is called  35ths of  their fermi velocity even at absolute zero electrons have this speed on average an electron will have 35 of what is called the  fermi energy  which  if we neglect relativity  might end up being something like about 10  8 cms in a metal in reality it s less than that because of various reasons  relativity  and it feels a kind of  drag  from the crystal lattice   but the point is it s huge ultimately this speed comes from the fact that in quantum mechanics only one electron can have a specific position and momentum thus once a single electron is in the lowest speed state it hogs it and the next electron has to go into one state higher  only room for one per state  and then the next one has to go higher and so on until you have as many electrons as atoms  or some set electrons per atom depending on the atom   thus the very last electron ends up  even at absolute zero  being in quite a highfast energy state and the  average  electron has a speed somewhere in between this top electron and the very lowest energy electron  however  all that speed is organized in a very specific way and has not net motion in any one direction thus the current it produces is zero  the next biggest effect is temperature  which effectively takes those electrons from their lowest energy state and allows them to go into higher energy states and scatter with one another on average the extra energy  and thus speed  an electron gets from this is about 10  6 cms  so a hundred times smaller than the fermi speed   however  like the fermi speed stuff  there is not net thermal motion in any one direction and thus this does not contribute to a net flow of electrons  finally  coming in at a wopping 10   3  cms for something like a copper wire is the drift velocity which is the result of the net drift and diffusion these electrons do if the area to their right is at a slightly different potential then their left  ie a voltage is applied across   the simplest  and fairly accurate model  for what the speeds of electrons in something like a semiconductor are like is what s called a maxwellian  and one with a voltage applied is called a  displaced  maxwellian see fig 2 page 5 of this  https  nanohuborgresources1526downloadchoicedistributionfunction_wordpdf the y axis is essentially the amount of electrons and the xaxis is the net velocity they have  above the fermi velocity  in a given direction notice when it s not displaced that the tails at the end may go out to quite high velocities but it s irrelevant since it s symmetric it s only when it s displaced slightly  and i mean slightly  this cartoon is highly exaggerated  that electrons make net motion that is the current ,d01wai4,askscience,learning,1455632994.0,cantgetno197,1.0,0.0,6,4845,0.0
gt  temperature is dependent on the average kinetic energy of matter this is false  it s a common highschool mantra that is not true in general  generally it is meant the temperature of the cmbr the cmbr has a thermal spectrum  is in thermal equilibrium and thus has a definite temperature of 27 k it looks like radiation emitted by a blackbody at that temperature the reason is this background was actually emitted by the dense gas filling the early universe at a much higher temperature at the moment it became transparent  then the subsequent expansion of the universe cooled it to the current value photons are sort of magical in that the expansion of space mantains them at thermal equilibrium  even though they do nt interact and could nt reach equilibrium on their own  but lowers the temperature as the wavelengths are stretched ,d01pajv,askscience,learning,1455610237.0,rantonels,3.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0

not really  but sort of white noise is a signal that has just as much energy in every single frequency  pitch  component that s what it means there are other noises  like pink and brown noise  which have half and a quarter  respectively  as much energy as you go twice as far up the frequency there is something that is called  black noise   but largely as a joke silence you can read more about the colors of noises  here   https  enwikipediaorgwikicolors_of_noise   but basically  most of these names come from  if you had light which was made up of the frequencies following the same pattern  what colour would they look like ie white light has equal energy  roughly speaking  at all wavelengths and  black light  aka darkness has no energy at any frequency  hence silence ,d01c44y,askscience,learning,1455584690.0,NeuroBill,18.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

this is a really good question  even if you have the complete dna sequence of a molecule  it wo nt do anything by itself dna is chemically inert and needs other proteins  such as polymerases and transcription factors in order to know what to do not to mention how its folded in regards to nucleosomes makes a big deal on how certain regions are expressed  the problem is really that every cell has come from a fully formed cell before it that has divided to form two cells in order to create a brand new replicating cell we need to create both the dna itself  and the incredibly complex chemical environment of a preformed cell at the moment recreating am entire cell from scratch materials is nt really feasible  however  for simpler biological systems  specifically viruses  this is totally possible for many viruses if you just insert their naked genome into a permissive cell you ll get infectious particles in that sense as long as we have the sequence of the genome of a virus it s never truly extinct  as dna synthesizing becomes cheaper and more inhouse this could actually become a problem any lab with access to the sequence of the smallpox genome  a dna synthesizer  and the right cell cultures  could easily produce infectious smallpox virions ,d007o7d,askscience,learning,1455502990.0,KillerPacifist1,6.0,0.0,1,5664,0.0

no  the blur you see underwater is caused by simple physics the focal point of a lens depends on the shape of the lens as well as the index of refraction inside and outside the lens when you go into water  your eye is suddenly surrounded by water  n  133  instead of air  n  1   so the image becomes blurry because the lens of your eye is now trying to make an image behind your retina instead of on top of it the same problem would be there for a fixed lens camera  the solution is pretty simple  make a lens with the right curvature to focus an image properly underwater we can design underwater cameras  and evolution can build underwater eyes sea animals have eyes that are shaped to work underwater  and would probably see a blurry image when they try to poke their heads into the air  of course  some animals need to see underwater and above water animals like the penguin what do they do  they have a lens that can be distorted much more than our our we have a flexible lens too  that is why we can focus on close or far objects but a penguin can change the focus even more so its lens can work in water or air ,d01wqjl,askscience,learning,1455633840.0,AugustusFink-nottle,21.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0
ah yes  a teachable moment in dynamic content  what happens when your browser loads an image link from a webpage is that it makes a connection to the server  which it figures out from the url  then it sends the url to the server and says  hey  do you have this file  could you send it to me   and then the server can send back that image file  if it decides it has it  but here s the important part of this whole thing  what exactly happens on the server in between getting the request and sending back the file  the answer is  anything the server wants to do anything  the server could check for files under the appropriate local filesystem directory path and then read that from disk and return it the server could instead decide to query a database for a matching filesystem path and then return the data stored in the database or  the server could dynamically generate an image file that is unique to each requestor which means that the server can make an image that show s everyone their own ip address  for example or  the server could return random images to everyone or  the server could show everyone the same image except for one person who gets a different image  for whatever reason  there are some interesting lessons from this first is that what you see when viewing a page may not be the same as what someone else sees usually it s too much work to go to the effort to handtailor different images and content for different users  but it should nt be ruled out another is that every webserver that s serving you an image has your ip address and can log your access to that file that means  if a scammer or attacker sends you a spam email or link they could easily verify your email address and collect your ip by using embedded images  if you allow them to be shown ,d01qugd,askscience,learning,1455616148.0,rocketsocks,2.0,0.0,500,85150,1.0

well firstly  gravity is nt a wave  but there can be waves in the gravity field meaning changes in gravity are sent via waves  but even without those waves there is still a gravitational pull  interpreting your question loosely however  yes this does work and we ve known this for a long time  https  enwikipediaorgwikishell_theorem shell theorem is one example  whereby inside the shell the force of gravity is canceled out  the downside of course is that the only way we know to create an equalbutopposite source of gravity is by having the equivalent amount of mass  so if we wanted to  cancel  the earth s gravity  we would need something with the mass of the earth this of course would only really cancel out for an instant  before it smashed into the earth and obliterated the world as we know it  so basically  no  it wo nt be useful for  canceling  gravity ,d02c67v,askscience,learning,1455655774.0,Daegs,3.0,0.0,139,10054,0.0

if the density of the earth was uniform  than you would be correct that as you go deeper gravity would get steadily weaker because there is less mass below you and more mass above you however  the density of the earth is not uniform specifically  the very outermost layers of the earth are less dense than some of the lower outer layers as a result  gravity gets stronger for a little while as you get closer to the these denser  lower outer layers but then as you go deeper  the density of the earth stops increasing so dtrastically  and gravity gets weaker as you go lower  until it reaches zero at the center  take a look at this graph   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb550earthgravitypremsvg2000pxearthgravitypremsvgpng ,d0298lm,askscience,learning,1455651909.0,chrisbaird,4.0,0.0,1,21416,1.0

i have a question about the double slit experiment in my understanding  the double slit experiment creates an interference pattern  since a particle can follow two different trajectories of different length  one for each of the slits therefore  it would take the particle a different amount of time to go through slit a compared to slit b  let s say that the trajectory through slit a takes 1 time unit  and the trajectory through slit b takes 12 time units if we close slit b  we will detect a particle after 1 time unit if we close slit a  we will detect a particle after 12 time units but what will happen if we open both slits  after how many time units will we detect the particle  if we  repeatedly  measure for the arrival of the particle after 1 time unit  will we still get a probability that corresponds to an interference pattern  even though the particle through slit b could nt have arrived yet  would nt that transfer information faster than light  bonus question  i understand the interference disappears when we observe through which slit the particle goes however  it is not clear to me what counts exactly as observation for example  if the particle is an electron  and there happens to be a proton near slit a  would this count as observation  what if we measure the change of velocity of this proton  what if we measure the change of velocity of this proton  but only after the electrons have arrived at the detector ,45u7t7,askscience,learning,1455501356.0,math1985,3.0,0.0,29,4501,0.0
i would have to think a bit more on this one  but what directly comes to mind it that you assume that the detection time is somehow deterministic in the standard double slit experiment  your incoming particles tend to have well defined momenta and have a lot of uncertainty on the position this uncertainty in the position makes it impossible to predict when the particle will be where this makes it hard to predict when exactly your particle will enter your slits  so my feeling is that you would actually have some randomness in your detection times things may get a bit more precise by using wave packets  but once you can start distinguishing your pathways by the time degree of freedom  you will probably not see interference fringes because the spatial extent of your wave packets may just be smaller than distance between the slits  such that any wave packet only sees one slit  long story short  i believe the uncertainty principle will forbid you from getting both this time resolution and the possibility of interference note  however  that you are not destroying the interference pattern by measuring arrival times  to be able to distinguish pathways by using arrival times  your experiment s parameters would have to be tuned in such a way that you would not have interference fringes even if you did not resolve the time  could be i am overlooking something  feel free to correct me ,d01eznr,askscience,learning,1455589181.0,awesomattia,3.0,0.0,1,484,0.0
first of all  generally 4d is meant to be 31 dimensions  with one of them time  which is our current spacetime s dimensionality so you d mean 5d  or 41  a lot of physical theories are susceptible to being generalized to different dimension most field theories readily are  em can be formulated in any dimension  however the properties of magnetism can become a bit alien in 5d for example  the electrically charged objects are still point particles  but the magnetically charged objects  which in our universe should be monopoles  so 0dimensional  would be 1branes  or 1dimensional strings also  em waves have 2 polarizations in 4d  in 5d they would have 3 this is part of a class of very important generalizations of em that appear in supergravity and string theory  gravity  general relativity  is funny in higher dimension  it does essentially what you expect it to do there is an attractive force between masses  but it falls off faster with distance  in 5d it s an r  3 force this makes all orbits unstable  and it s impossible to have planetary systems  actually the same is true for the coulomb potential in em  so also atoms are impossible    there s black holes  but there s also a plethora of extended  black brane  things that have higher dimensionality gravitons  or gravitational waves  have 2 polarizations in 4d  in 5d they would have 5  this pattern works for dgt   4 but everything fails for d  3 in 3d general relativity spacetime is always flat and there is no gravitational force also  no gravitational waves it s a really weird thing and has a huge theoretical relevance  now these were field theories another important class is statistical mechanics systems  where in thermal equilibrium time is not really important only the spatial dimensions really matter so when a statmech person says 3d  he just mean 3 spatial dimensions then  many famous statistical systems  ising  landauginzburg  are hard in 3d  easy in 4d  and somewhat doable in 2d weird pattern ,d01oydl,askscience,learning,1455609113.0,rantonels,19.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0

the words  perpendicular    orthogonal  and  normal  all essentially mean  meeting at right angles    unfortunately  the term  normal  itself means several different  unrelated things  depending on the context  generally  you can interchange all three terms and no one will care however  there are actually subtle differences between the terms or  at the very least  cases where one term is used predominantly over the others   we say that two vectors  arrows  or lines are perpendicular if they meet each other  intersect each other  at right angles the term  perpendicular  is generally used only for this geometrical concept  and usually only when referring to perpendicular lines or vectors   a collection of vectors  elements of an abstract inner product space  are orthogonal if their inner product is zero when the inner product space is r   n  with the usual euclidean inner product  this is the same as  perpendicular   almost two lines can have orthogonal direction vectors  yet not be perpendicular themselves  eg  the lines do nt intersect   if the inner product space is not r   n   then there really is no geometrical counterpart to orthogonality for instance  the functions sin  x  and cos  x  are orthogonal in l   2    0  2pi    note also that we can speak of  orthogonal collections  of vectors  but we usually do nt say  perpendicular collections    if a vector meets a surface at right angles  then we say that the vector is normal to the surface we could just say that they are perpendicular  but there is a certain assymetry in this case since one of the objects is a surface  ie  not a line or other vector   so we use a different term  which is  normal   again  no one will really think twice if you talk about two vectors in some abstract vector space being normal or a vector being perpendicular to a surface or two lines being orthogonal it s just that in each of those cases  we tend to use different terms if you had to choose one term as a safe catchall  i would go with  orthogonal   in any case where you can use any of these three terms   orthogonal  pretty much never sounds awkward  unlike the other two ,d006cxt,askscience,learning,1455500544.0,Midtek,31.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0
perpendicular is the geometric word meaning  that meets at a right angle   orthogonal is a slightly more general term  given a set  a group of things  with an  inner product   http  mathworldwolframcominnerproducthtml   meaning an operation that is the  product  of two such things and that gives a real number   two  orthogonal  objects means that their inner product together is zero  in euclidean space  the space of the  xy  or  xyz  vectors you usually see in college   the inner product  or dot product  between two vectors is defined as the product of the norms of the vectors and the cos of the angle between them  or the sum of the product of the vector s coordinates in this space   orthogonal  vectors are perpendicular  however  you could define other spaces with inner products for instance  you could define a space of functions and the inner product could be the integral of the product of the two functions over a certain interval in that case  two  vectors   which would be functions  would be orthogonal if the integral of their product is zero however  you ca nt really say that the functions are  perpendicular   as they are not geometrical vectors in the usual sense  defining such spaces with inner products allows you to take pretty much all the results you see in college linear algebra and apply them to a bunch of objects  not just vectors and systems of linear equations but also realvalued functions  sequences  or other sets  these spaces are called  hilbert spaces   https  enwikipediaorgwikihilbert_space  definition  and need to meet a few more properties which i did nt mention here  but you can read the wikipedia page for more info or ask if you want more details on any of it that is not clear ,d0081b6,askscience,learning,1455503623.0,AnonXXI,5.0,0.0,338,3534,0.0

yes  definitely the idea that the universe is expanding is not a metaphor  but is a very real physical process the distance between faraway clumps of the universe really is getting larger with time  for example  we define the observable universe by the furthest objects we could observe because their light would have had time to reach us considering that the universe is about 14 billion years old  in a static universe that would come out to a distance of 14 billion light years but in reality when the light we now receive was emitted  the sources must have been much closer to us than 14 billion light years  but it took so long to reach us because the distance it had to cross was continuously increasing as the light was traveling  if you like a more visual explanation  take a look at  this diagram   http  iimgurcom3pj1xlepng   which captures the same idea   source   https  dournacorginfolight_geodesics   edit  added the figure and fixed some units,d01y5tl,askscience,learning,1455636324.0,crnaruka,761.0,0.0,16106,98856,1.0
absolutely  however  the expansion of space only dominates over gravity on very large scales  more than about 10 million light years or so that is to say  light is taking longer coming here from distant galaxies  but it s not taking any longer crossing the space between your monitor and your eyes  or even between us and the opposite side of our own galaxy ,d027i95,askscience,learning,1455649579.0,green_meklar,7.0,0.0,122,95713,1.0

i m gon na piggyback this post with another  hopefully not stupid  question  so  when space expands  are distances increasing  but nothing else  like  would the space in between atoms also expand  such that distances between objects in terms of the size of the objects remains constant  or is it like space is expanding  but the the effects of natural forces does nt expand with space  so atoms can not spread out and expand  and that s how the distances between galaxies increases but not the size of the galaxies  if the latter is true  then how can we differentiate between expanding space and shrinking forcesother natural phenomena ,d027pqo,askscience,learning,1455649866.0,iamanatertot,3.0,0.0,1,153,0.0

the way i see it  gravitational  information  is more of a  delta   you get information when the entire system changes that s a little bit different from sending a signal from point a to point b  from our point of view  as objects fall deeper into the black hole  changes occur very very slowly there is an infinite amount of space between us and the singularity  so even though objects are accelerating inwards  we see the changes happen at a reduced rate the changes in gravity are observed at the same reduced rate  and objects falling into a black hole make gravitational changes at a relatively slow pace  at least compared to what it would be if we were at  flatter  gravitational levels ,d00p4qq,askscience,learning,1455550047.0,AgentSmith27,1.0,0.0,1,14996,0.0

well let s start from the beginning how does you body make energy from food  glucose does nt just magically turn into raw energy that your body can use instead  it is subjected to dozens of chemical reactions performed by enzymes in your body the enzymes are proteins honed over millions of years of evolution for perform basically a single reaction at speeds thousands or millions of times faster than would occur otherwise the pathway that turns glucose into atp  which is the main energy currency of your body is pretty complicated  but if you want a simple image just imagine a factory that takes in coal at one end  and runs a powerplant at the other there are special machines that first clean the coal  then sort the coal  then grade it  then crush it  then transport it  then dump into the furnace that is specially designed for sorted  graded  cleaned coal you could nt just dump a tree  or a container of natural gas in one end  and expect the factory to work  now your body has a lot of enzymes designed to deal with all sorts of compounds and lots of those compounds can end up being turned into atp  energy you body can use   fats and proteins obviously  but also other things  for instance ethanol but importantly  not everything lots of compounds your body has only rudimentary one size fits all  processes to deal with or some compounds  like water  are at the bottom of the energy ladder as far as your body is concerned this is why you ca nt drink petrol and hope to burn it for energy you body has no enzymes to convert it to atp so zero calorie energy drunks have no  or very few  compounds that your body can convert to energy they have no sugar  no protein  no fats just caffeine and water and artificial sweetener  the other thing that i realize now that is throwing you off is the word  energy   energy drinks are so called because the claim to give you a feeling of energy  this is due to caffeine  and perhaps sugar in the nondiet ones   they are not claiming that they supply your body with biologically relevant energy sources  they are claiming they will give you a feeling of energy due to the caffeine ,d02gqwp,askscience,learning,1455661966.0,NeuroBill,9.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

long story short  not really there is probably a weak correlation of some kind  no data   but in general  it wo nt matter at the practical end  first  the idea of an  element  being toxic is misleading take phosphorus for example it is very common  dna contains phosphorus   but white phosphorus  its  elemental  form  will kill you straighton similar can be said of oxygen  where its radical and ozone forms are toxic but o2 is not unless in extreme quantities and then there are cases like barium  somewhat abundant  but not so much in absolute terms   which is toxic in its ionic state  but you can still ingest barium sulphate because it just does nt dissolve in water  even in the stomach  second  toxicity depends not on the abundance of an element but on its properties  location on the periodic table can be a rough guide   xenon is very uncommon  but it is generally nontoxic because of its inertness gold is another case where it is nontoxic for the same reason but which is quite abundant on the other hand  aluminium  very common  is somewhat nontoxic only because the body has a good system to sequester and clear it once that system is compromised  aluminium can accumulate in the bone and cause problems  as often seen in people with kidney problems  third  different organisms have different need and tolerance for certain elements copper is toxic in small quantities to many organisms  but some need copper as part of haemocyanin there are marine animals that intentionally stock up on vanadium to become toxic to predators you can easily see here that the definition of  toxic  can be a bit subjective from here on  the idea that uncommon elements are toxic comes largely because they tend to be metals andor are radioactive in most isotope forms  not simply because of their rarity  again  it may have some influence  but is not a big factor   look at the really toxic ones they are either heavy metals  mercury  uranium  or undergo pretty quickdamaging radioactive decay  radon   correlation does not necessarily mean causation ,d018436,askscience,learning,1455578244.0,fush_n_chops,2.0,0.0,110,16650,0.0

dna is the code that determines the proteinsgenetic traitsetc for an organism  but the code itself is really just a basic part of a very convoluted greater system within a cell what genes get accessed  how those proteins interact  how the cells divide  how the cells differentiate and everything else are part of complex signaling cascades your neurons are way different than your skin cells  even with the same dna  due to these developmental signaling pathways  obviously when humans make a baby  we do nt just form from dna strands we form from cells  sperm and egg  with their own dna that fuse and activate all these pathways that are part of the  very complex  developmental process we ve evolved but take away the normal environment of fertilization  and things get a bit trickier we ve successfully cloned animals  but it took a lot of attempts and modifications aside from just replacing a cell s dna with dna of choice each species of cloned animal had different scientific hurdles that had to be overcome in order to be produced  and still other issues with the cloned animal once it was alive  which are progressively more difficult the more complex the species is   in less complex organisms  cloning is easier you could probably easily plop in your dna of choice and it would go on to make an organism but i do nt know all the technical limitations involved  so  really  you always need dna as part of a cellular structure because the dna does nt really form the structures outright  it exists first in concert with them  including many proteins and their signaling pathways dna is not just this magic ingredient that forms an organism it is accessed in specific ways to sort of run the  development program  of an organism in a very complex pattern of activation and repression of specific genes ,d008f26,askscience,learning,1455504295.0,HoboZoo,3.0,0.0,1,963,0.0

the information is encoded in the gravitational field which extends all the way through infinity  i ll explain it with charge because it s more immediate  but it s roughly the same with mass  say you have an electron outside and far from the black hole this electron has a charge and field lines extending out to infinity we can imagine a very large sphere surrounding both the black hole and the electron computing the total flux of the electric field through the sphere   counting field lines that reach infinity   gives the total charge inside  this is gauss  theorem this charge must always  always be conserved nothing in the universe can change this  we lower the electron in the black hole the field lines can distort  but they must still reach to infinity there s nothing we can do by moving our puny electron that can change this very global fact about the behaviour of the field at infinity as the electron crosses the horizon  we do nt knowcare what has happened to it  but we are sure there still is the same number of field lines  now emanating from the horizon  extending all the way to infinity the total charge has not changed  and the black hole is now charged  there is no need for the charge information to get out sure  if the electron wiggles inside the horizon  the  radiation  it emits can not get out but the coulomb field is a bit different from radiation  and retains itself the information about the total charge charge can actually be seen as a geometrical property or even a topological invariant of the electromagnetic field itself  it has a sort of nonlocal nature you can measure it even though you re far away and have no causal contact with the stuff that has the charge  you just need to scan a surface enclosing it  in suitable situation and with smart definitions  mass in general relativity works in a very similar way  an aside  obviously you can not communicate from inside to outside the horizon using the information of the total masscharge because those things can not be changed  since they are strictly conserved  superconserved is the actual term   everything fits together ,d00l0do,askscience,learning,1455540664.0,rantonels,17.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0

this is a difficult question it depends a bit on what  shuffle  means shuffle s can not be organized or they d be predictable so by their nature they introduce randomness progressively through many progressions of pseudorandomness generated by the vague aspects of our capabilities to manipulate card using our hands more specifically if we could shuffle so each card fell exactly over the next card perfectly then the whole deck would be in its exact same order after some set number of shuffles i forget how many  however shuffles can be modeled the notion is that they will slowly grow away from their first organization and achieve perfect randomness that s quite a lot of shuffles before patterns are lost in the original deck  something like 11 still even then if the deck was perfectly random there is a chance that some cards are in exactly the same order with one of their adjacent cards  so what about the first card it is one of 52 cards its chance of being one of those 52 cards is 1 its chance of being adjacent to its next card is 151 its chance of lying beside a card that is nt its partner is 5051 the 2nd card has probably the same probability of not lying beside the 3rd as an original adjacent partner and through the deck the entire probability of having a deck with no original partners looks like  5051   51 or 36 equivalently its about 74  likely at least one card in a random deck is adjacent to its original partner  that may not answer your question  which i think might be rephrased as   how many times should i randomize a deck of cards if i want a 50  chance of finding two cards adjacent to an original partner  ,d00eb3m,askscience,learning,1455516478.0,bloonail,2.0,0.0,1,4242,0.0

myoglobin is useful for sperm whales and other aquatic mammals  but if you live on the surface hemoglobin is much more useful this is because of  cooperative binding   https  enwikipediaorgwikicooperative_binding   a topic i ve been thinking about a lot lately let s talk about why cooperative binding is useful and then come back to your question  the challenge in getting oxygen to your cells is that oxygen does not like to dissolve in water as your blood moves through your lungs  the partial pressure of oxygen will determine the oxygen concentration  but because of the low solubility of oxygen this is nt a very high concentration in the water itself  less than mm   when the blood moves by your cells the effective partial pressure of oxygen is lower so the oxygen diffuses in to make an analogy to electronics  your blood is a weak capacitor that charges to a certain  voltage   partial pressure o2  in your lungs  moves to your cells  and then partially discharges to bring their voltage up close to what exists in the lungs  this would be more efficient if we could increase the  capacitance  of your blood that is what red blood cells do red blood cells have hemoglobin  a protein that binds oxygen the lets the blood absorb more  charge   ie oxygen  in the lungs  and when the blood makes it to the cells more charge is transferred  for a normal capacitor the charge transferred will be proportional to the voltage drop adding more red blood cells can increase the capacitance but what if we could design a nonlinear capacitor that transferred more charge  that is actually what hemoglobin does the  charge   amount of oxygen  that loads onto hemoglobin is proportional to something like voltage  25 or so this relationship is given by the  hill equation   https  enwikipediaorgwikihill_equation_  biochemistry     by comparison  myoglobin behaves like a normal capacitor  the hill coefficient is one   that is why hemoglobin useful for transporting oxygen to your cells  ok  with that out of the way  what if you could increase your hemoglobin concentration  ie your red blood cell concentration   it would make you a better endurance athlete in fact  this is the reason why athletes train at high altitude it forces your body to make more hemoglobin to deal with the lower partial pressure of oxygen it is also why some cyclists try to use  blood doping   https  enwikipediaorgwikiblood_doping   where they save some blood  spin it down to concentrate the red blood cells  and inject it back before a race  but we also have myoglobin on our muscle cells what is that doing  well  it creates an  extra capacitor  for your cells hemoglobin in the blood can charge this capacitor up  but if you hold your breath the myoglobin is going to make sure your cells keep some oxygen to spare if you had more myoglobin  you could hold your breath longer but this is nt as easy to change myoglobin in a variety of aquatic mammals has evolved to contain  a higher surface charge   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent34061381234192   which is thought to let them pack more myoglobin into their cells without forming aggregates  tldr  increased myoglobin would help you hold your breath longer  but hemoglobin is more important for endurance ,d01kqa6,askscience,learning,1455598666.0,AugustusFink-nottle,2.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

if you were to claim that something exceeded the speed of light  you would have to have  damn  good evidence even if we could nt explain how the neutrinos got to us before the supernova  it would just be an open problem to figure out  rather than evidence for them going faster than the speed of light nothing going faster than the speed of light is a law of physics just as important as the conservation of energy  we re not going to let a few neutrinos topple that we re not looking to find something that goes faster than the speed of light  because there s no way it would be consistent with anything else that we do know about the universe  but  we  can  explain the neutrinos because we know how supernovas work and we know that they spit out neutrinos before light has a chance to escape additionally  we know that neutrinos move slower than the speed of light due to them having mass as a result of  neutrino oscillation   https  enwikipediaorgwikineutrino_oscillation   which won the 2015 nobel prize ,d02ml7h,askscience,learning,1455670945.0,functor7,7.0,0.0,1151,26847,1.0

the information is encoded in the gravitational field which extends all the way through infinity  i ll explain it with charge because it s more immediate  but it s roughly the same with mass  say you have an electron outside and far from the black hole this electron has a charge and field lines extending out to infinity we can imagine a very large sphere surrounding both the black hole and the electron computing the total flux of the electric field through the sphere   counting field lines that reach infinity   gives the total charge inside  this is gauss  theorem this charge must always  always be conserved nothing in the universe can change this  we lower the electron in the black hole the field lines can distort  but they must still reach to infinity there s nothing we can do by moving our puny electron that can change this very global fact about the behaviour of the field at infinity as the electron crosses the horizon  we do nt knowcare what has happened to it  but we are sure there still is the same number of field lines  now emanating from the horizon  extending all the way to infinity the total charge has not changed  and the black hole is now charged  there is no need for the charge information to get out sure  if the electron wiggles inside the horizon  the  radiation  it emits can not get out but the coulomb field is a bit different from radiation  and retains itself the information about the total charge charge can actually be seen as a geometrical property or even a topological invariant of the electromagnetic field itself  it has a sort of nonlocal nature you can measure it even though you re far away and have no causal contact with the stuff that has the charge  you just need to scan a surface enclosing it  in suitable situation and with smart definitions  mass in general relativity works in a very similar way  an aside  obviously you can not communicate from inside to outside the horizon using the information of the total masscharge because those things can not be changed  since they are strictly conserved  superconserved is the actual term   everything fits together ,d00l0do,askscience,learning,1455540664.0,rantonels,17.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0

sf6 is a solid at 1 atmosphere  or 1 bar  so boiling  does nt happen there since there is no liquid phase boiling  is a common term for liquidvapor equilibrium and sublimation  is the correct term for solidvapor equilibrium the vapor pressure of sf6 is above 1 bar  23 bar  at its triple point temperature of 496  c this is also the lowest pressure that you can talk about liquidsolid equilibrium  or melting as temperature is reduced further  the solidvapor equilibrium curve yields ever lower pressures when you move along that sublimation  curve  you eventually reach a sublimation pressure of 1 bar  at a temperature of 634  c so yes  the melting point   triple point  at 23 bar is indeed at a higher temperature  less negative  than the sublimation point temperature at 1 bar  but its not correct to refer to that point as boiling this is normal  however  for most substances  its just that the pressures are higher than atmospheric pressure ,d02ov5h,askscience,learning,1455674403.0,qwerty222,1.0,0.0,5745,1590,0.0

hi everyone  i have a bit of a science question that i would really appreciate an answer or even a good place to research further unfortunately my year 7 science education is nt enough to cover this one  context  my friend was telling me that water actually boils at different temperatures based on the pressure it is exposed to if the pressure is low enough  water will boil at room temperature  i vaguely remember knowing this but when i read further  also found another interesting fact  as the water boils  it gets colder because the hotter molecules are the ones first to boil out and get sucked up by the vacuum decreasing the pressure  questions   is this true  does water get colder as it boils if you applied some sort of vacuum suction to it or is there another mechanism   how long would it take before we could chill it to 0c  i presume at this temperature  if we suddenly exposed it to room pressure then it would phase change straight back to ice   is there a table or equation that can explain this decrease in temperature  ie is there some way that we can calculate at what rate the temperature of water decreases for given rates of pressure decrease ,4603dc,askscience,learning,1455587065.0,siecos,2.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
oh yes  both boiling point depression from lowering pressure and evaporative cooling are real phenomena you can see both of these in  this youtube video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  poygdqp4euc   where the water boils and freezes in about 90 seconds you can also see that it will not immediately change back into liquid water when exposed to atmospheric pressure  because the ice is still cold  gt  does water get colder as it boils if you applied some sort of vacuum suction to it or is there another mechanism  boiling is an endothermic process  it draws energy from the system even when you boil water at atmospheric pressure at 100 c  the system stays at 100 c because any added heat goes into boiling water instead of heating the water up more beyond 100 c this same idea applies for lowpressure boiling  when no heat is applied  gt  is there a table or equation that can explain this decrease in temperature  the relationship between the phases of matter  temperature  and pressure is shown in a  phase diagram   https  enwikipediaorgwikiphase_diagram   specifically  check out  this one for water   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons008phase_diagram_of_watersvg   notice how at room temperature  decreasing pressure will lead to water going into vapour phase  so it boils ,d029qo6,askscience,learning,1455652579.0,rupert1920,7.0,0.0,193,55774,0.0

dark energy is introduced because the expansion is observed to be accelerating  this is a nobel prize   it can be easily seen through examination of the friedmann equations that this can not be explained neither by matter  including dark and baryonic  nor radiation  massless or ultrarelativistic particles   in particular it is found that the following relationship must hold between the pressure and energy density of the component that drives the acceleration  p lt   13  the aforementioned components have pgt   0 and so they re not fit any additional component with an equation of state satisfying the above would be called dark energy or a dark energy variant the simplest  but not the only  possibility would be p    which is the behaviour of a cosmological constant  vacuum energy ,d01p3c2,askscience,learning,1455609564.0,rantonels,9.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0
gt  why could the explanation not be that the universal lengthscale just is not constant or something along the lines  one thing to keep in mind  einstein derived general relativity by thinking about the consequences of gravity and acceleration behaving equivalently from this key insight  he was able to outline field equations that determine how mass  pressure  and energy warp spacetime to produce what we perceive as a gravitational force around a planet or star but those same equations also can determine the possible shapes of the entire universe and how it expands with time dark energy was in those equations from the start  in the form of a cosmological constant whose value could only be determined by by fitting to observations  what is amazing is that a theory that was developed to reconcile the different points of view of observers near planets and stars turned out to also fit the data that would later be collected showing an expanding universe it fits that data pretty well with a cosmological constant that was zero when we finally got more accurate redshift measurements from very distant objects in the 90 s  it was clear that a nonzero cosmological constant was needed  so when dark energy gets explained in the popular press  it often sounds like a cludge inserted into the models of the universe to make them work but given that the cosmological constant was there in the field equations all along  it is actually should make you more confident that general relativity correctly describes the universe on these scales an alternate explanation that something else like a  universal length scale  is affecting the universe to make it accelerate would mean we would need to develop an alternative to general relativity that would be a little premature given that this theory can explain every measurable effect of gravity so far  on scales ranging from a falling apple to the observable universe ,d01qw33,askscience,learning,1455616333.0,AugustusFink-nottle,6.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0
gt  why could the explanation not be that the universal lengthscale just is not constant or something along the lines  funny thing  the universal length scale not being constant  is  universal expansion that s actually what  the universe is expanding  means  for any abstract space to be a model of our spacetime  it needs to admit a certain type of structure  among others  called a  metric   or  distance function  which  given two points  would return the distance between them in space andor time  making this model of space a  metric space  the most standard model of the universe these days uses the  flrw metric   https  enwikipediaorgwikifriedmann  e2  80  93lema  c3  aetre  e2  80  93robertson  e2  80  93walker_metric   which has a  scale factor  component that is described by a function of time  at different times in the universe s history  the scale factor has had a different value  and not only is it not constant  but it is  very  not constant  in the early universe it was much  much smaller and rapidly grew to a large size  this was  cosmic inflation   presumably driven by some unknown mechanism   then suddenly slowed to a near stop  and since then has been growing very slowly ever since  but we observe that the rate at which it is growing is increasing  things are nt just  moving  away from eachother  they re  accelerating  away from eachother   as if  there were a repulsive force yet there does nt seem to be any other forces acting on the various objects in the universe this can be explained with nothing more than standard general relativity  but only if the universe has a small energy density even in the vacuum of space if the universe were to have an  energy cost of having space   this background energy density would have consequences for the curvature of spacetime  affecting the scale factor even a tiny bit of energy  coupled with the  vastness  of space  would have the observable effect of increasing the rate of expansion over time this  dark energy  is the simplest mechanism to accomodate for the observed accelerating expansion of the universe  requiring very little extra mathematical machinery to formalize  since it is incorporated via the cosmological constant  which has been part of general relativity more or less since its inception   there are other more complicated proposed ways too  for example promoting the cosmological constant into a dynamic field like a scalar field  hope that helps ,d01u1hy,askscience,learning,1455627848.0,hikaruzero,3.0,0.0,1,15831,0.0

myoglobin is useful for sperm whales and other aquatic mammals  but if you live on the surface hemoglobin is much more useful this is because of  cooperative binding   https  enwikipediaorgwikicooperative_binding   a topic i ve been thinking about a lot lately let s talk about why cooperative binding is useful and then come back to your question  the challenge in getting oxygen to your cells is that oxygen does not like to dissolve in water as your blood moves through your lungs  the partial pressure of oxygen will determine the oxygen concentration  but because of the low solubility of oxygen this is nt a very high concentration in the water itself  less than mm   when the blood moves by your cells the effective partial pressure of oxygen is lower so the oxygen diffuses in to make an analogy to electronics  your blood is a weak capacitor that charges to a certain  voltage   partial pressure o2  in your lungs  moves to your cells  and then partially discharges to bring their voltage up close to what exists in the lungs  this would be more efficient if we could increase the  capacitance  of your blood that is what red blood cells do red blood cells have hemoglobin  a protein that binds oxygen the lets the blood absorb more  charge   ie oxygen  in the lungs  and when the blood makes it to the cells more charge is transferred  for a normal capacitor the charge transferred will be proportional to the voltage drop adding more red blood cells can increase the capacitance but what if we could design a nonlinear capacitor that transferred more charge  that is actually what hemoglobin does the  charge   amount of oxygen  that loads onto hemoglobin is proportional to something like voltage  25 or so this relationship is given by the  hill equation   https  enwikipediaorgwikihill_equation_  biochemistry     by comparison  myoglobin behaves like a normal capacitor  the hill coefficient is one   that is why hemoglobin useful for transporting oxygen to your cells  ok  with that out of the way  what if you could increase your hemoglobin concentration  ie your red blood cell concentration   it would make you a better endurance athlete in fact  this is the reason why athletes train at high altitude it forces your body to make more hemoglobin to deal with the lower partial pressure of oxygen it is also why some cyclists try to use  blood doping   https  enwikipediaorgwikiblood_doping   where they save some blood  spin it down to concentrate the red blood cells  and inject it back before a race  but we also have myoglobin on our muscle cells what is that doing  well  it creates an  extra capacitor  for your cells hemoglobin in the blood can charge this capacitor up  but if you hold your breath the myoglobin is going to make sure your cells keep some oxygen to spare if you had more myoglobin  you could hold your breath longer but this is nt as easy to change myoglobin in a variety of aquatic mammals has evolved to contain  a higher surface charge   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent34061381234192   which is thought to let them pack more myoglobin into their cells without forming aggregates  tldr  increased myoglobin would help you hold your breath longer  but hemoglobin is more important for endurance ,d01kqa6,askscience,learning,1455598666.0,AugustusFink-nottle,2.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

one theory that is interesting to me shows a relationship between a word s entropy and how funny we perceive it to be this is known as the snunkoople effect the reason it is interesting is that at the forefront of physics now is a theory called information theory that seeks to break down our perception of the world into its most fundamental unit information nonsense words are higher entropy and thus less predictable and so we find them more funny so perhaps we just find unpredictability humorous  http  wwwphysorgnews201511worldmathematicaltheoryhumorhtml,czzuf76,askscience,learning,1455479323.0,MathematicalMystic,8.0,0.0,1,61,0.0

hello i did a lot of googling and there seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the new discovery  in one paper i read that only accelerating things emit gravitational waves  in the other i read that only moving objects do if only moving objects do  moving compared to what   could anyone explain how does this work exactly  another question  they are waves  so they should have frequencies and amplitudes  how do those values get determined exactly ,45nyv2,askscience,learning,1455414720.0,Ricike,271.0,0.0,1,33,0.0
yes  accelerating masses produces gravitational waves  with the caveat that the mass distribution ca nt be spherically or cylindrically symmetric  and yes  these waves have frequencies and amplitudes the frequency is determined by the frequency in the changing mass distribution that produces the wave for example  in the binary black hole system  the gravitational wave frequency is  twice  pdf    http  journalsapsorgprlpdf101103physrevlett116061102  the orbital frequency this is why the frequency of the detected signal increased at the end  as the two black holes were spinning around their center of mass faster and faster the amplitude is determined by the way the mass distribution is changing  namely by the second time derivative the quadrupole moment ,czz4i25,askscience,learning,1455417187.0,fishify,54.0,0.0,3,56629,0.0

edit  haha  i work at mit and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed  they want to watch the announcements  as expected  there  s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread  so i  ll try to clear things up  amp  nbsp    what are gravitational waves    in order to understand gravitational waves  it  s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work we  ll first take a look at something more familiar  the electromagnetic field  note  this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook   the electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields  the electric field  e  and the magnetic field  b   the electric field is generated by particles with  electric charge   such as electrons  1 charge  and protons  1 charge   here  s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges  amp  nbsp  https  enwikipediaorgwikifile  vfpt_charges_plus_minus_thumbsvg amp  nbsp  as you can see in the picture  the convention is that electric field lines come  out  of positive charges and go  into  negative charges  if you already have an e field and you put a charge in it  the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation  from coulomb  s law   f  e  q where f is the force  e is the electric field  and q is the charge this force has a direction  for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines  for negative charges it points backwards  since q is negative   now  what does this have to do with gravitational waves  well  let me ask you the following question  what happens if i have 2 charges  a and b  far apart from each other  and i suddenly move charge a  1  the e field changes instantly  with charge b immediately  seeing  the new position of charge a  2  the e field changes first at charge a  and then the change propagates outward until charge b  sees  the change a while later  amp  nbsp  http  istackimgurcomga6fsgif amp  nbsp  as you can see  the answer is 2 changes in the electric field  radiate  outwards at a constant speed  the speed of light in fact  this radiation is light  our eyes are actually supersensitive eamp  b field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world  amp  nbsp  most importantly for our purposes  this principle of changes  radiating  outwards at the speed of light is   universal   for all fields and forces in the universe including gravity the caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the eamp  b fields  so you need to have incredibly   huge   masses moving around extremely violently  and incredibly   sensitive   detectors to pick up their movements  the biggest masses in our universe are black holes the most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other and ligo is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them  we  re almost done  the last question is  what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like  and as a corollary  why do black holes collide in the first place  well  most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems  systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes  still in orbit but why would they collide  why not just keep orbiting forever  well  massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves those waves carry energy  and that energy has to come from somewhere  in this case  it comes from the orbital energy so over a very long time  the orbits slowly collapse  the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other as this happens  the  orbital frequency  increases  the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter this is a universal principle of gravity  if you look at our solar system  you  ll see that mercury orbits much faster than earth  while pluto is much slower  so  as 2 black holes spiral towards each other  we expect to see a   chirp    gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity  rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge  amp  nbsp    what is ligo    even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves  the ripples produced are still incredibly weak  requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 11000th the diameter of a proton or less so a very amazing detector is required  ligo is basically an extremely sensitive distancemeasuring device  called an interferometer the way this works is the following  you start with a laser beam  then you split it into 2 equal beams  typically using a halfsilvered mirror that reflects 12 of the beam and lets the other 12 through  and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles when they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror when the beams return to you  you recombine them into a single beam and they  interfere   depending on how far each beam travelled  this interference can be either  destructive  or  constructive   meaning the beams can either cancel each other out  or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter  at ligo  they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive  meaning that no light arrives at their detector but  when a gravitational wave comes in  it distorts spacetime  changing the lengths of the beams  and they no longer perfectly cancel out  thus  a light signal appears at the detector  i strongly suggest you watch the following video  which has a good visual representation of the process  around 1  30   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rzzgfkoifqi amp  nbsp    why is this so damn exciting     so many reasons  the incredible technical achievement  measuring changes down to 1 part in 1000000000000000000000 the longawaited confirmation of gravitational waves  which is a huge deal in itself perhaps most of all  the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy  one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our universe  finally  this result gives us some confidence that we  ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the big bang  and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe  tl  dr  there are no real tl  drs in science  and why would you want one  it  s worth it to try and understand cool things

the visibility of the beam is mostly due to  mie scattering   https  enwikipediaorgwikimie_scattering   ie tiny particles  dust or liquid droplets  in air that are larger than the wavelength of the light it has no strong wavelength dependence  which is why fog  clouds  dust and smoke usually look greywhitish if you shine a laser through them it will just scatter in the same colour as the beam if you used dust particles of a peculiar material or shape  like quantum nano dots   you might be able to exploit a resonance  and a certain wavelength would be scattered more intensely    on a much weaker level you have reighley and raman scattering  where photons interact with individual moleculesatoms those have a strong material dependence  because here resonances matter   and can actively shift the spectrum of the scattered light but the cross section is much smaller than miescattering  for each moleculeatoms are way smaller than the typical piece of dust  so it s less likely to be hit by a photon reighley scattering is the process that turns the sky redblue at noonevening  but only after kilometres of atmosphere  even though these processes  and other higher order processes  are weak  people do use them in industrialresearch settings  to modify the spectrum of lasers by sending the beam through long gas filled fibers  they usually do nt care about the scattered part though they are rather interested in the transmitted part by shifting the wavelength of their source according to their needs     edit  another idea  if you not really want to scatter light  but just want it to look cool  you could create dust of some uvfluorescent dye  hopefully a not too toxic one  and use a uv laser the dust will scatter uv light  which you do nt care about  but the uv will also be partly absorbed by the dust and make it glow in various colours along the direction of the beam,d02jobo,askscience,learning,1455666380.0,giantsqueed,2.0,0.0,67,319,0.0

the order of operations is nothing more than human notation  11  2  right  but that s just a bunch of symbols they do nt  mean  anything on their own it s just lines on paper  or a screen   the point is that we simply all agree on the fact that  1  and  2  represent numbers of a certain value  that    means we are adding the values on either side of the symbol  and that    means everything on the left has the same value as everything on the right it s just notation humans have created to make communication and record keeping easier  the same thing is true for the order of operations for example  we say 11   5  6 while  11    5  10 in the first case we say multiplication comes before addition in the second case we say parenthesis comes before multiplication but that s only true because mankind has agreed that s how we want to do things if we  did nt  have the order of operations then people would disagree on how to solve 11   5 it would be confusing some people would do the addition first and some people would do the multiplication first there would be no rules  and people would get different answers for the same problem  if the whole point of writing math down is to keep track of our work and communicate mathematical ideas with other people  then we need to use a consistent  language  that everyone knows how to interpret the order of operations is just part of the  math language  that mankind has invented  we  could   for example  use different rules maybe we want to change and just say that math should always be done left to right  no matter what the operations are so 11   5 and  11    5 would both be equal to 10 we could have gone that way in an alternate universe perhaps  the nice thing about using the  order of operations  is that it allows us to be more flexible going left to right means everything has to be in a very rigid order using parenthesis allows us to mix things up more without them we would also need some new ways to write certain problems for example  there would be no good way to write something like  11    12   the answer is 23 but if you re going lefttoright only  there s no way to explain how  12  is supposed to be the denominator of the whole thing ,d014q32,askscience,learning,1455573082.0,jofwu,3.0,0.0,1213,21889,0.0

leaving aside the specific question of dopamine and  feelgood chemicals   this could be regarded as a subset of the question  why does being alive as a human  or animal  feel like anything at all   this is a question to which there is no universally agreed answer people throw around terms like  qualia  and  epiphenomenon   but nobody has really answered the question to everybody s satisfaction  probably the most universally agreed view is that the brain and body together constitute a system that gathers  processes and responds to information the question is why that necessarily feels like anything at all none of the individual steps in that process seem to inherently require a feeling we can imagine individual neurons producing action potentials   firing   without any associated experience in fact it is hard to imagine that a single neuron  isolated in a dish and chemically triggered would have any kind of experience  what follows from that for most people is some sense that the  feeling  somehow emerges from the arrangement of the whole neural system  that it is somehow the sum of all the different processes occurring inside us  sometimes in harmony  sometimes in conflict  that gives rise to this feeling of being  in this view there is nothing inherently  feelgood  about any chemical what makes it a feelgood chemical is the pattern of activity it triggers in our brains in the case of neurotransmitters that are functioning correctly  the molecule is acting as a chemical bridge between two neurons giving off electrical signals  as part of  a pattern of activity associated with  good  outcomes  eg getting food  sex or social approval  or avoiding a negative outcome like injury   when functioning incorrectly  eg when release is artificially stimulated or simulated by ingested drugs  the  reward  pattern is being triggered without an actual external reward being present  but still  the question of why any of it feels like anything eludes us all we know for sure is that it does  and that there are unavoidable relationships between our brain activity and how we feel some hold that brain activity and mindfeeling are exactly the same thing  others that this makes no sense nobody has a complete answer that satisfies everyone else who is interested in the question ,czzglq7,askscience,learning,1455449199.0,theartificialkid,14.0,0.0,39,946,0.0

i can try to address a more ultimate theory of humor  evolutionary  not mechanistic   humor and creativity are kind of weird aspects of human nature because they re very difficult to account for under darwin s natural selection theory why are we creative  why do we make jokes  there have been a lot of different theories of this some people think they are mere side effects of human intellect  exaptations  and others think that they serve some sort of adaptive function  social brain hypothesis   geoffrey miller has proposed that many of our cognitive functions are the result of sexual selection  another of darwin s theories  explored in  the descent of man    this would propose that humor and creativity serve as honest indicators of quality in potential mates for example  humor  creativity  and intelligence are all highly correlated or potential mates with less parasite resistance may not have the excess energy to expend on creative behaviors under this theory  creativity and humor would be displays  advertisements for mates  it s pretty interesting stuff ultimately it can be difficult to apply evolutionary theory to human culture and behavior rigorously but if you re interested in reading more about it karmihalev s  2013  review  why creativity is sexy  is readily available online and unites a lot of the evidence in favor of miller s theory  edit  sorry  ignored your specific questions originally let me take a stab at them under miller s hypothesis this is just my own theorizing of course  some research has suggested that while females generally prefer a mate with a good sense of humor  males tend to prefer a mate that is receptive to humor  bressler et al  2006  bressler and balshine  2006  clegg et al  2011   so uncontrollable bouts of laughter may be the appropriate response  advertising a preference for humor  which may make a mate more desirable there s no need for this to be restricted by sex  though  as humans are fairly monogamous and have likely been acted upon by sexual selection for both sexes  given our high parental investment or perhaps it s a bit more fisherian  with a correlated sexlimited trait and preference for humor that might lead to an expression of that trait in both sexes dependent on certain steroid and hormone levels  as far as other animals go  there seems to be a correlation between intelligence and practically useless cognitive feats like humor and creativity so i would guess there may be a threshold of intelligence that must be crossed for the expression of humor there s some evidence of a threshold for creativity around 100120 iq points  jauk et al  2013   i would guess that if humor is present in animals  it would be in social animals with high intelligence and high parental investment great apes are obvious  our closest ancestors might try dolphins and whales  too  though but i do nt know what the literature says  edit  fairly monogamous thanks for keeping me honest ,czzt820,askscience,learning,1455477256.0,wsferbny,261.0,0.0,84,15006,0.0

i posted this on facebook last night  and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful   gravitational waves are one of the last major  unconfirmed predictions of general relativity  a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity general relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around they are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces  but because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism  we can see light all the time  just look around   while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly  absurdly  precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation rumors are flying that ligo  just such a system of lasers and detectors  has found a gravitational wave signal  probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other  because that s the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect   this would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there  rather than reveal something new and shocking about the universe think the higgs boson a few years ago it would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out  not  to be there  general relativity has worked extremely well so far  and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s  which won the 1993 nobel prize in physics ligo s  direct  detection would undoubtedly be nobelworthy  too  the only question is whether it would happen this year  this is exciting because a  it s direct  rather than indirect  confirmation that these things are there  and b  they ll open up a whole new window onto the universe pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation  from visible light to xrays  the ultraviolet  microwaves  what have you starting now we d have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos  delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes  so all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow  ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics or they could just be fucking with us ,czw1fgk,askscience,learning,1455202696.0,adamsolomon,848.0,0.0,279,37095,0.0

 generating it  could mean many things let s break the question into a few smaller bits     1  can we be sure we know the genetic sequence    we can be pretty confident  but there is a snag when it comes to repeated regions sequencing costs have come down enormously over the past decade  but current techniques rely on sequencing many randomly generated short segments and then using a computer to identify where they overlap to build the genome sequence eukaryotic genomes often have long regions of repeated dna  so if the short segments of dna you sequence are shorter than the length of the repeated region  you will never know how many repeats the original genome had on top of this  the genome is nt quite fixed between cells of one organism  with small alterations building up between the stem cells in different regions as you age these problems are less of a concern in bacteria  but they might pose a larger challenge for making synthetic multicellular life     2  can we generate the genetic sequence synthetically    yes we can only directly synthesize a few hundred bases before errors start to become very common but thanks to tricks like  gibson assembly   https  enwikipediaorgwikigibson_assembly   we can make those short synthetic dna bits assemble into longer sequences again  there is a challenge when it comes to long stretches of repetitive dna  because the reassembled dna might skip a repeated section and these regions can shorten easily during pcr amplification  but these are technical challenges that moneytime can overcome     3  can we put the synthetic genome inside a preexisting cell and make it work    this is at the edge of our abilities now more than 10 years ago viable polio virus was created from  synthetic dna   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent29755831016long   other commenters mentioned the success of  gibson et al   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent329598752  in generating viable bacteria using synthetic dna but doing this with other species will be trickier dna in multicellular organisms needs to have much more epigenetic regulation than in singlecelled organisms that is because your neurons  skin cells  muscle cells  etc all have  very nearly  the exact same dna in them the epigenetic differences are what differentiates those cells from each other large portions of the genome have to be silenced in a viable cell  and different regions are silenced in different cells this silencing is accomplished through many different mechanisms working at the same time  and there is much we do nt understand even taking existing differentiated cells and and turning them back into stem cells  called  induced pluripotent stem cells   https  enwikipediaorgwikiinduced_pluripotent_stem_cell   is very difficult getting a full  sequence  of all the epigenetic features of a cell line is beyond our current abilities right now if we just tried to exchange a synthetic genome of naked dna into  say  mouse cells  the cells would be reading all the wrong bits of dna at once     4  can we synthesize the rest of the cell    as in  how far away are we from generating life from direct synthesis of not just dna  but the proteins  membranes  etc  this is far  far beyond what we can do cells are extremely efficient factories for generating complex molecules and assembling them into larger functioning units and we do nt even know everything that is in a cell this would be like asking a child with a lego set to build a tesla    tldr   some simple life forms can be generated from synthetic dna right now  but for multicellular organisms this will be much harder ,d00do37,askscience,learning,1455514917.0,AugustusFink-nottle,45.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

it depends on what you mean by  generate   but  genetic sequences don  t create cells from nothing a genome is housed in a cell  and it got there from another genome that was housed inside a parental cell  and so on  going all the way back billions of years to the origin of cellular life if you want to  generate  the organism from scratch  it  s not a question of pure information  you have to provide the genetic sequence with a very particular environment  that in nature would have simply been inherited from a progenitor cell so it  s a physical problem of making and then putting thousands of different components together in very complex ways  and to do that  you  d need incredibly advanced biomolecular technology  you also need additional information about the physical and informational structure of the organism that is not contained in the genetic sequence  look into  epigenetics   https  enwikipediaorgwikiepigenome   depending on the complexity of the cell you want to make  generation from scratch might involve synthesizing lots of different organelles  different kinds of membranes  a microtubule framework  a cytoplasm with just the right chemical makeup  and putting all these things together in exactly the right way so the genetic sequence can operate correctly in the cell you  ve made for it that is something far beyond our abilities at present  and this is only considering single cells with multicellular organisms you  d face a whole host of problems relating to embryogenesis and development if you think about your genetic sequence  it didn  t allow you to come into being fully formed  in an arbitrary environment you started from a single cell in which your genome was configured epigenetically in a very specific way your subsequent development completely depended on being attached to a placenta inside your mother so no  just knowing your genetic sequence doesn  t allow you to be generated in a lab somewhere  with very simple organisms like bacteria  you can sometimes get away with substituting one genome for a quite different one  and the new instructions will still function with the foreign cellular  machinery   there  s been a lot of work in this area  perhaps the most high profile being craig venter  s  life 20  project  although it really falls under the heading of  partially synthetic organism  rather than  generating life from scratch  ,d007ls0,askscience,learning,1455502868.0,pluteoid,22.0,0.0,216,780,0.0

this is a really good question  even if you have the complete dna sequence of a molecule  it wo nt do anything by itself dna is chemically inert and needs other proteins  such as polymerases and transcription factors in order to know what to do not to mention how its folded in regards to nucleosomes makes a big deal on how certain regions are expressed  the problem is really that every cell has come from a fully formed cell before it that has divided to form two cells in order to create a brand new replicating cell we need to create both the dna itself  and the incredibly complex chemical environment of a preformed cell at the moment recreating am entire cell from scratch materials is nt really feasible  however  for simpler biological systems  specifically viruses  this is totally possible for many viruses if you just insert their naked genome into a permissive cell you ll get infectious particles in that sense as long as we have the sequence of the genome of a virus it s never truly extinct  as dna synthesizing becomes cheaper and more inhouse this could actually become a problem any lab with access to the sequence of the smallpox genome  a dna synthesizer  and the right cell cultures  could easily produce infectious smallpox virions ,d007o7d,askscience,learning,1455502990.0,KillerPacifist1,6.0,0.0,1,5664,0.0

dna is the code that determines the proteinsgenetic traitsetc for an organism  but the code itself is really just a basic part of a very convoluted greater system within a cell what genes get accessed  how those proteins interact  how the cells divide  how the cells differentiate and everything else are part of complex signaling cascades your neurons are way different than your skin cells  even with the same dna  due to these developmental signaling pathways  obviously when humans make a baby  we do nt just form from dna strands we form from cells  sperm and egg  with their own dna that fuse and activate all these pathways that are part of the  very complex  developmental process we ve evolved but take away the normal environment of fertilization  and things get a bit trickier we ve successfully cloned animals  but it took a lot of attempts and modifications aside from just replacing a cell s dna with dna of choice each species of cloned animal had different scientific hurdles that had to be overcome in order to be produced  and still other issues with the cloned animal once it was alive  which are progressively more difficult the more complex the species is   in less complex organisms  cloning is easier you could probably easily plop in your dna of choice and it would go on to make an organism but i do nt know all the technical limitations involved  so  really  you always need dna as part of a cellular structure because the dna does nt really form the structures outright  it exists first in concert with them  including many proteins and their signaling pathways dna is not just this magic ingredient that forms an organism it is accessed in specific ways to sort of run the  development program  of an organism in a very complex pattern of activation and repression of specific genes ,d008f26,askscience,learning,1455504295.0,HoboZoo,3.0,0.0,1,963,0.0

 nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ,d02hlps,askscience,learning,1455663201.0,NeuroBill,1.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

crystal field theory approach  ligands are negative point charges that approach from an infinite distance to bind the metal cation in a metal atom with no ligands bound  the dorbitals are energydegenerate as ligands approach from the vertices of an octahedron  for example  they will  see  the dz2 and dx2dy2 orbitals more than  for example  the dxy orbital this will raise them in energy relative to the three orbitals that point between the ligands that the metal cation binds of course  the full model would have to consider electrostatic attractions between the positive center and negative ligands leading to lower energies all around as compared to what you would expect when these interactions are not considered  mo approach  orbitals on the ligands comparable in energy and in proper phase will mix with orbitals on the metal center to generate molecular orbitals when ligands bind at the vertices of an octahedron  they will  see  one or more dorbitals more than the other ones this will lead to linear combination of atomic orbitals to generate your molecular orbitals in a process similar to what you had to have learned in intro classes from this mixing  you d get a bonding and an antibonding orbital out and at this point it makes no sense to discuss  metal dorbitals  since they cease to exist instead  you have molecular orbitals which you d typically see classified by symmetry labels indicating degeneracy and multiplicity  think t2g  eg   these orbitals in fact are delocalized across several ligands and the simple  valence  model approaches its limit of usefulness the real picture is closer to this covalent model than a picture of charges or electrostatic interactions  note that this explanation does nt take into account pibackbonding and other second order effects that might change relative ordering of energy levels ,d024gqy,askscience,learning,1455645464.0,cheeseborito,6.0,0.0,1,7631,0.0

you certainly can see lasers with the naked eye  it s just very dangerous to look at them directly  because they can damage your retina irreparably  you need to think about the light coming out of a laser like a stream of bullets from a rifle they go completely straight  and once properly focused form a tight beam lasers can be made so that the diameter of the beam does nt change by more than fractions of an inch over miles of distance  just like you can stand off target from a rifle and not be hit by a bullet  you can stand beside a laser and not see the beam the photons have to hit your pupil for you to see the laser  assuming the laser is emitting visible light   normal light sources are like shot guns in comparison  the light flings out in all directions  though again  the can be focused  though not as well generally speaking   but again  you can only see the light if photons from that source hit your pupil and are focused onto your retina  so why can you see a laser when it goes through a mist  well to extend out rifle analogy  this is akin to firing the rifle into a concrete wall  and you get ricochets  which now might hit you anywhere when the laser photons hits the particles of mist they are refracted around  bending this way and that  each little droplet of mist is a little prism  and some of them get bent around until they fly into your eye  and then you can see them this is also why you can see lasers in dusty rooms  the little particles of dust are also prisms   you can change the colour of the laser light by the process of fluorescence here the fluorescent molecule absorbs light at one wavelength  but emits it at a very different wavelength this is not restricted to laser light this is what happens to your tshirt under  black light  aka uv light there are chemicals in the tshirt that absorb the uv light and emit light at a variety of wavelengths  appearing white ,d02i4yv,askscience,learning,1455663997.0,NeuroBill,5.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

there are two answers to this question   1  a charged black hole  no spin  has 2 characteristic length scales  r  _s_   the schwarzschild radius  and r  _q_   no special name afaik   the black hole itself has two horizons  an outer event horizon and an inner socalled cauchy horizon if you cross the outer event horizon  you are doomed to keep falling inward toward the inner cauchy horizon  and then cross it into a region where you are then free to move around again as usual this region is very strange though it contains ctc s  closed timelike curves  and you can approach the singularity at the center as close as you want and then move away you can even then cross back through the cauchy horizon  after which you are doomed to keep falling outward  cross the event horizon  and then emerge in a topologically equivalent universe  not the same one though   it s a strange metric to say the least  if the charge of the black hole is large enough  the two horizons coincide  and if the charge is even larger than that  there are no horizons  this occurs when 2r  _q_  gt  r  _s_    the singularity at the center is naked  you can approach as close as you want  poke it with a stick  leave  and report your findings to someone else the black hole is said to be superextremal  if you work out r  _q_  and r  _s_  for an electron  treating it as a black hole  you find that the electron would have to be superextremal in other words  the electron  if it were a charged  nonspinning black hole  would be a naked singularity there are some discussions in the literature about what a  black hole electron  would mean  and i think there is even a wikipedia page on it afaik  a black hole electron is consistent with gr and qft part of the problem of verifying such a claim is that the value of r  _q_  is like 10   37  m and r  _s_  is like 10   57  m both length scales are orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length so a full quantum theory of gravity would be necessary to describe the black hole electron  there is also no practical way of probing lengths that small   2  the simpler answer is really that although two black holes can supposedly be distinguished only by m  mass   j  spin   and q  charge   that does nt mean that any two objects with the same value of m  j  and q are indistinguishable all this means is that  if  we know both objects are black holes  then m  j  and q suffice as a characterization if the objects are not black holes  then we should not expect that to be enough ,d02fme8,askscience,learning,1455660386.0,Midtek,11.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

no  we currently do nt know of any fixed upper limit for the size of a black hole there are some practical limitations though for example  most supermassive black holes grow by feeding on a bright disk of gas  called the accretion disk  as shown here   http  wwwphysicsoftheuniversecomimagesblackholes_accretionjpg   basically what happens is that matter floating around the black hole ends up orbiting the black hole in this disk  bits of matter bang into each other heating up the gas  hence why it s bright   the friction from this process slows down the gas  which eventually allows it to fall into the event horizon of the black hole  however  recent papers have suggested that there may be a limit to the size of the black hole where it can still grow by eating up its accretion disk for example   this paper   http  arxivorgpdf151108502v2pdf  suggests that when the black hole reaches a critical mass  mc   the disk will be so massive that it will be able to clump up into stars and other large chunks of matter that will simply orbit the black hole instead of falling in however this critical mass is insanely large at about 50 billion solar masses  moreover  even this size is not an absolute limit these black holes can continue to increase in ways that do nt require an accretion disk  eg by eating up another black hole ,d01zmdo,askscience,learning,1455638622.0,crnaruka,324.0,0.0,16106,98856,1.0

small correction  superstrings are all in 10d mtheory is in 11d  but it s not a string theory  it has no strings  so   when going from superstrings to us  we compactify 10  4  6 dimensions  typically on a calabiyau   when going from m to us  we compactify 11  4  7 dimensions  yes  all sorts of wacky stuff can happen in string theory in the extra dimensions strings  let s call them fstrings  can move in  and  wrap around the extra dimensions  dbranes can do the same but in much more complex ways  and also formfields can  flow  through the small dimension  this is called flux   all of these elements will affect 4d physics in complex ways this is a  huge  subject and i do nt think i can fit all of those things together in a reddit comment  about entanglement good question entanglement is a prediction of quantum mechanics and since string theory is naturally a quantum theory  then intuitively it should nt really provide a  mechanism  for entanglement or quantum phenomena certainly extra dimensions in particular have nothing to do with it  since  for example  you can entangle two strings in 10 large dimensions   but it s possible there is a connection  or even a duality of sort  between quantum mechanics and the geometry of spacetime susskind and co have conjectured  er  epr  that suitably entangled groups of particles seem  in some sense  to be literally connected by a  non traversable  wormhole or wormholelike structure  meaning that this geometrical feature could be an equivalent expression of the entanglement it would be cool if it was found that there is a complete mapping between geometry and quantum mechanics  we already know strings create spacetime  though it s not known how to formulate it you usually put strings in a background  stage   but  once provided with quantum mechanics  the strings feature a graviton state which can equivalently be reinterpreted as curvature of the background spacetime  they re complementary pictures it s sensible therefore to deduce that the background was not really necessary to begin with that s why strings are backgroundindependent  contrary to what some people claim   given that quantum mechanics is similarly a  background   or an axiom  for strings it would be interesting if the same could be done to quantum mechanics  giving it an equivalent description in terms of geometry  however  all of this is strictly conjectural ,d01pz9i,askscience,learning,1455612720.0,rantonels,8.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0

without sitting down and walking through all of solid state physics i ll just say there are essentially three cuplrits that add up to the total speed  fermi velocity  thermal velocity  drift velocity by far and away the biggest component of an electron in a metal s velocity is what is called  35ths of  their fermi velocity even at absolute zero electrons have this speed on average an electron will have 35 of what is called the  fermi energy  which  if we neglect relativity  might end up being something like about 10  8 cms in a metal in reality it s less than that because of various reasons  relativity  and it feels a kind of  drag  from the crystal lattice   but the point is it s huge ultimately this speed comes from the fact that in quantum mechanics only one electron can have a specific position and momentum thus once a single electron is in the lowest speed state it hogs it and the next electron has to go into one state higher  only room for one per state  and then the next one has to go higher and so on until you have as many electrons as atoms  or some set electrons per atom depending on the atom   thus the very last electron ends up  even at absolute zero  being in quite a highfast energy state and the  average  electron has a speed somewhere in between this top electron and the very lowest energy electron  however  all that speed is organized in a very specific way and has not net motion in any one direction thus the current it produces is zero  the next biggest effect is temperature  which effectively takes those electrons from their lowest energy state and allows them to go into higher energy states and scatter with one another on average the extra energy  and thus speed  an electron gets from this is about 10  6 cms  so a hundred times smaller than the fermi speed   however  like the fermi speed stuff  there is not net thermal motion in any one direction and thus this does not contribute to a net flow of electrons  finally  coming in at a wopping 10   3  cms for something like a copper wire is the drift velocity which is the result of the net drift and diffusion these electrons do if the area to their right is at a slightly different potential then their left  ie a voltage is applied across   the simplest  and fairly accurate model  for what the speeds of electrons in something like a semiconductor are like is what s called a maxwellian  and one with a voltage applied is called a  displaced  maxwellian see fig 2 page 5 of this  https  nanohuborgresources1526downloadchoicedistributionfunction_wordpdf the y axis is essentially the amount of electrons and the xaxis is the net velocity they have  above the fermi velocity  in a given direction notice when it s not displaced that the tails at the end may go out to quite high velocities but it s irrelevant since it s symmetric it s only when it s displaced slightly  and i mean slightly  this cartoon is highly exaggerated  that electrons make net motion that is the current ,d01wai4,askscience,learning,1455632994.0,cantgetno197,1.0,0.0,6,4845,0.0

you re absolutely right that it has to do with the size of the ion  as a simple approximation  look at the equation for  electric potential energy   https  enwikipediaorgwikielectric_potential_energy   you can see that it depends on 1r  meaning that the closer you get to the charge  the stronger the interaction if you model an ion as a hard sphere with a charge at the center of it  not a terrible approximation   then any molecules with dipoles  like water  will be able to get closer and closer to the ion until they hit the edge of the sphere and can go no further  this means that the smaller your ion is  for a given amount of charge  the closer the water can get  and the stronger the interaction a stronger interaction with water means that in order for the ion to move  it has to  drag  more water with it  slowing it down  as your textbook pointed out ,d01rm1h,askscience,learning,1455619359.0,almightycuppa,3.0,0.0,2266,1252,0.0

this is a difficult question it depends a bit on what  shuffle  means shuffle s can not be organized or they d be predictable so by their nature they introduce randomness progressively through many progressions of pseudorandomness generated by the vague aspects of our capabilities to manipulate card using our hands more specifically if we could shuffle so each card fell exactly over the next card perfectly then the whole deck would be in its exact same order after some set number of shuffles i forget how many  however shuffles can be modeled the notion is that they will slowly grow away from their first organization and achieve perfect randomness that s quite a lot of shuffles before patterns are lost in the original deck  something like 11 still even then if the deck was perfectly random there is a chance that some cards are in exactly the same order with one of their adjacent cards  so what about the first card it is one of 52 cards its chance of being one of those 52 cards is 1 its chance of being adjacent to its next card is 151 its chance of lying beside a card that is nt its partner is 5051 the 2nd card has probably the same probability of not lying beside the 3rd as an original adjacent partner and through the deck the entire probability of having a deck with no original partners looks like  5051   51 or 36 equivalently its about 74  likely at least one card in a random deck is adjacent to its original partner  that may not answer your question  which i think might be rephrased as   how many times should i randomize a deck of cards if i want a 50  chance of finding two cards adjacent to an original partner  ,d00eb3m,askscience,learning,1455516478.0,bloonail,2.0,0.0,1,4242,0.0

sigmund freud had a theory on this generally he identified humorous pleasure as the release of tension the pleasure comes from having to exert less mental effort than expected  think of the scene in annie hall where woody allen sneezes on some cocaine and blows it everywhere there is a release of tension  since prior to that moment  he is trying very hard to impress his friends but when he sneezes  the tension is released  since he has failed to impress them the viewer is no longer tense on allen s behalf  an example freud gives is some children putting on a play they have written  for an audience of adults the play features a couple the husband goes away to sea  and comes back several years later  having earned some money the wife says  i too have not been idle   and pulls back a curtain to reveal the children she has had the audience laughs  because the implication is that the wife has cheated on the husband  but the children performing the play do not understand this the children treat the apparent infidelity as no cause for concern  whereas to an adult it is the opposite the difference between the amount of emotion an adult would expend in the depicted situation  and the amount of emotion the characters portrayed by the children expend  is treated by the audience as an economy  according to freud the audience does not have to exert any mental effort in simulating the emotion of the characters  or to empathise with that emotion  since the emotion is absent  and this saved effort is pleasurable  this is discussed in freud s book jokes and their relation to the unconscious ,czzpq2p,askscience,learning,1455471372.0,control_group,28.0,0.0,2964,2947,0.0

it s a little hard to answer because i do nt know how much you know about electricity and electronics  but we re going to start from the basics  first thing is  you need to understand the concepts of voltage and current in order to understand them  we re going to use the fluid analogy imagine a circuit of tubes  filled with water  and a pump driving the water around and around the pump provides pressure  which drives a flow of liquid against the resistance of the the pipes this is equivalent to a voltage source  providing voltage  to drive current against a resistance big voltages make more current flow against the same resistance or a bigger resistance makes less current flow at the same voltage this gives rise to ohm s law v  ir  voltage  currentresistance  we can continue to extend our analog inductors are like a water wheel in our flow if we initially have our pump stopped  and turn it on  all the pressure will build up behind the water wheel  which will eventually starting to get it turning once the water wheel is turning at the speed that the current would flow if the water wheel was nt there  then the water wheel provides no resistance at all moreover  if we try to stop or pump suddenly  the water wheel will keep spinning  because of its inertia   and try to force water through our tubes  making a massive pressure in the pipe  because the pump is off   this is what inductors do when you turn the voltage on and try to drive current through them  the provide a lot of resistance  but once the current is flowing through them  the provide very little resistance but if you try to stop the current flowing suddenly  they can make massive voltages to attempt to keep the current flowing  how do inductors do this  by producing and storing magnetic fields all conductors produce a magnetic field when current flows down them similarly  a  changing  magnetic field around a conductor produces current inductors are coils of wire designed to take advantage of these facts being made as a coil of wire  each wire s magnetic field interacts with every other wire when you try to start pushing current through  the magnetic fields starts to grow  and it tries to push current in the other direction  which makes it hard to start the current through the inductor however  once the current is stable  the magnetic field no longer changes  and hence it no longer tries to induce current in the opposite direction when you try to stop current flow instantly  the large magnetic field is there and it starts to collapse  change   which then tries to drive the current through the inductor note  the magnetic field is growing to begin with  which induces a current opposing the current flow  the magnetic field is collapsing at the end  which produces current in the direction that it was being driven in the first place  and why do we use them  1  because you can see they behave differently when the current is constant  no resistance  ie the spinning water wheel  no changing magnetic field  to when the current is changing  changing magnetic field produces opposing currents   they are used in filters ie currents behaving at certain frequencies can be gotten rid of by inductors 2  changing voltages the ability for inductors to make big voltages when you try to turn them off rapidly is used to make simple voltage converters you put a low voltage into an inductor  switch it off  then store the large voltage spike you get  and use a diode to stop it leaking away this voltage converter is called a boost converter  and it is very common 3  inductors turn up by accident basically all electromechanical devices  motors  solenoids  relays behave as inductors because they have coils of wire transformers also behave as inductors  though it s less by accident there   so electrical engineers need to know how inductors behave because they can produce nasty effects if you do nt think about it  that effect where if you try to stop the current going through an inductor and it produces big voltages is very real  and will damage things if you do nt protect the circuit against it   so  to sum up inductors are circuit elements that are hard to get current to flow through initially  but try to keep the current flowing there after they work by creating a magnetic field  which stores the energy and tries to induce currents we use them as filters and voltage producers and they also turn up by accident ,d01eb6v,askscience,learning,1455588124.0,NeuroBill,3.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

heat  and more specifically temperature  is a measure of kinetic energy  so the hotter something is  the higher the temperature and the faster the molecules are vibrating and moving in sulfur hexafluoride  the forces in between the molecules are nt enough to hold them together as a liquid before they rocket off  so it sublimes into a gas  another way to think about this is with water hydrogen bonds and vanderwaals forces hold water molecules together  and when it freezes  the molecules move slower  so the bonds get stronger and water becomes ice since sf6 does nt have hydrogen bonding and has weak intermolecular forces  it ca nt be held together after a certain point  so it never has an opportunity to become a liquid from a solid ,d024zzk,askscience,learning,1455646198.0,GonzoAndJohn,2.0,0.0,406,2767,0.0
sf6 is a solid at 1 atmosphere  or 1 bar  so boiling  does nt happen there since there is no liquid phase boiling  is a common term for liquidvapor equilibrium and sublimation  is the correct term for solidvapor equilibrium the vapor pressure of sf6 is above 1 bar  23 bar  at its triple point temperature of 496  c this is also the lowest pressure that you can talk about liquidsolid equilibrium  or melting as temperature is reduced further  the solidvapor equilibrium curve yields ever lower pressures when you move along that sublimation  curve  you eventually reach a sublimation pressure of 1 bar  at a temperature of 634  c so yes  the melting point   triple point  at 23 bar is indeed at a higher temperature  less negative  than the sublimation point temperature at 1 bar  but its not correct to refer to that point as boiling this is normal  however  for most substances  its just that the pressures are higher than atmospheric pressure ,d02ov5h,askscience,learning,1455674403.0,qwerty222,1.0,0.0,5745,1590,0.0

 nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ,d02hlps,askscience,learning,1455663201.0,NeuroBill,1.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

it is rather difficult for me not to give an advanced answer to your question the best intuition i can give is the following  suppose the spatial universe had positive curvature  instead of zero curvature  which is a flat universe   the prototypical example of a surface of positive curvature everywhere is a sphere the positive curvature means that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always more than 180 degrees  for instance if a space has positive curvature  it has to curve back in on itself to create that  convex  shape of the sphere so the space ends up having to  close up   which means it ends up being finite  there is a general mathematical theorem that states that any complete  riemannian manifold with positive  boundedbelow curvature must be compact it s not an easy theorem  if the curvature is zero everywhere  then the space can just spread out and does nt have to close in on itself so if it never closes up  it just goes on forever  and the space is infinite   the problem with this intuitive picture is that it s a bit wrong the part about a positive curvature space having to be finite is true the part about a zero curvature space having to be infinite is not true a zero curvature space  can  be infinite  but it can also do some odd things like repeat itself  while maintaining the flatness so this just begs the question why then must a flat universe be infinite     edit    to match the edit below it turns out that if space is flat  and  finite  then it must not be isotropic  which means that it does nt look the same in all directions but that statement is mathematically highly nontrivial  to answer that  i have to resort to some more advanced math    warning   some technical and mathematical language ahead someone else might come along to give a more accessible explanation of why flat   gt  infinite until then  requests for clarification are welcome   in the robertstonwalker cosmology  there are three possibilities for the  constant  spatial curvature  the curvature of hypersurfaces of constant cosmological time   determined by the sign of the curvature  positive  zero  or negative   3spaces of constant zero curvature  ie  a flat universe  come in essentially two types   e   3   which is just euclidean space this is a noncompact manifold   s   1  x s   1  x s   1   or the 3torus this is a periodic  compact manifold in this type of universe  you can head out in some direction and eventually come back to your exact starting point the spatial universe is finite  each of these spaces could  in principle  be the topology of the  spatial  universe but we usually rule out the 3torus either because it is periodic or because it is not simply connected  off the top of my head  i can not think of any feasible experimental way to rule out a nonsimplyconnected universe though     edit    oops  forgot to mention that the 3torus is also not  isotropic   which more or less means that space should look the same in all directions  so all that is left is e   3  if the universe is flat  whence the universe must also be infinite   there are  other  3spaces of constant zero curvature for instance  s   1  x k  where k is a klein bottle however  all other spaces that i did not list above are  nonorientable   which then must necessarily also be nonsimplyconnected   so if we do nt rule out a topology for not being simply connected  we would almost certainly rule it out for not being orientable a nonorientable space seems rather nonphysical  it turns out though that there are other deeper reasons to rule out spacetimes that are not spaceorientable it is believed that all interactions are invariant under simultaneous reversal of charge  parity  and time  cptinvariance    a formal statement of the theorem can be proved under some natural conditions  since weak interactions are not cpinvariant  it follows that in going around a closed curve in spacetime  either the sign of charge  the orientation of spacelike axes  and the orientation of time must all reverse  or none of them reverse  which follows from cptinvariance   hence a spacetime is timeorientable if and only if it is also spaceorientable  the question of spaceorientability then becomes one of timeorientability there are examples of spacetimes that are not timeorientable  but the idea of time nonorientability seems even less natural than that of space nonorientability  interestingly  if a spacetime is not timeorientable  it has a double covering space which  is  timeorientable  a spacetime that is not timeorientable presents the same sort of problems that closed timelike curves present  ie  time travel  because there would be closed curves that reverse the time orientation  and so would be able to reinterpret certain events as having occurred in the reverse order you end up getting the same sort of grandfather paradoxes that you hear about when time travel is brought up so we have  very strong  reasons to believe that our universe is timeorientable  which then means  by cptinvariance  that the universe is also spaceorientable ,d00bep2,askscience,learning,1455509918.0,Midtek,65.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

i m not entirely sure exactly the situation you are talking about so i ll give a few answers  if you mean something like the moon  there are a few reasons first  it s very far away so for something that far away to move quickly across the eye  it would have to either be moving much much faster that s just a function of geometry however  there is an additional reason which is that we are better at perceiving relative velocity  how one object moves in relation to another  rather than absolute velocity so forgetting about the size of the object in the real world  if you just had a light that projected to the same area of your retina  same retinal size   then you would be worse at detecting its motion than if you had a second light on nearby as well by worse at detecting its motion  i mean that it would have to be moving faster before you would perceive it as moving than for the case where there are two objects i should also note that relative motion can be relative to a textured background  not necessarily relative to a second object  in general  it really is the case that larger objects  or several fragments grouped into a perceptual whole  are perceived to have a slower velocity than smaller or multiple objects  verghese and stone  1995   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepii0042698995000382    1996   http  visionarcnasagovpersonnelleepublicationsperceived_visual_speed_conpdf    1997   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis0042698996001551    verghese and stone suggest that this is a function of scene segmentation this may also be due to motion pooling mechanisms your receptors at the level of the retina and in early visual cortex have relatively small receptive fields  they are detecting changes in contrast over time over a very small area of space subsequent visual areas  hmt  have to then pool that information to get a global motion percept cells in these areas have much larger receptive fields it is possible that there is some attenuation in the motion pooling  edit  a word,d011xd7,askscience,learning,1455569030.0,albasri,3.0,0.0,337,10662,1.0

long story short  not really there is probably a weak correlation of some kind  no data   but in general  it wo nt matter at the practical end  first  the idea of an  element  being toxic is misleading take phosphorus for example it is very common  dna contains phosphorus   but white phosphorus  its  elemental  form  will kill you straighton similar can be said of oxygen  where its radical and ozone forms are toxic but o2 is not unless in extreme quantities and then there are cases like barium  somewhat abundant  but not so much in absolute terms   which is toxic in its ionic state  but you can still ingest barium sulphate because it just does nt dissolve in water  even in the stomach  second  toxicity depends not on the abundance of an element but on its properties  location on the periodic table can be a rough guide   xenon is very uncommon  but it is generally nontoxic because of its inertness gold is another case where it is nontoxic for the same reason but which is quite abundant on the other hand  aluminium  very common  is somewhat nontoxic only because the body has a good system to sequester and clear it once that system is compromised  aluminium can accumulate in the bone and cause problems  as often seen in people with kidney problems  third  different organisms have different need and tolerance for certain elements copper is toxic in small quantities to many organisms  but some need copper as part of haemocyanin there are marine animals that intentionally stock up on vanadium to become toxic to predators you can easily see here that the definition of  toxic  can be a bit subjective from here on  the idea that uncommon elements are toxic comes largely because they tend to be metals andor are radioactive in most isotope forms  not simply because of their rarity  again  it may have some influence  but is not a big factor   look at the really toxic ones they are either heavy metals  mercury  uranium  or undergo pretty quickdamaging radioactive decay  radon   correlation does not necessarily mean causation ,d018436,askscience,learning,1455578244.0,fush_n_chops,2.0,0.0,110,16650,0.0

there are two answers to this question   1  a charged black hole  no spin  has 2 characteristic length scales  r  _s_   the schwarzschild radius  and r  _q_   no special name afaik   the black hole itself has two horizons  an outer event horizon and an inner socalled cauchy horizon if you cross the outer event horizon  you are doomed to keep falling inward toward the inner cauchy horizon  and then cross it into a region where you are then free to move around again as usual this region is very strange though it contains ctc s  closed timelike curves  and you can approach the singularity at the center as close as you want and then move away you can even then cross back through the cauchy horizon  after which you are doomed to keep falling outward  cross the event horizon  and then emerge in a topologically equivalent universe  not the same one though   it s a strange metric to say the least  if the charge of the black hole is large enough  the two horizons coincide  and if the charge is even larger than that  there are no horizons  this occurs when 2r  _q_  gt  r  _s_    the singularity at the center is naked  you can approach as close as you want  poke it with a stick  leave  and report your findings to someone else the black hole is said to be superextremal  if you work out r  _q_  and r  _s_  for an electron  treating it as a black hole  you find that the electron would have to be superextremal in other words  the electron  if it were a charged  nonspinning black hole  would be a naked singularity there are some discussions in the literature about what a  black hole electron  would mean  and i think there is even a wikipedia page on it afaik  a black hole electron is consistent with gr and qft part of the problem of verifying such a claim is that the value of r  _q_  is like 10   37  m and r  _s_  is like 10   57  m both length scales are orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length so a full quantum theory of gravity would be necessary to describe the black hole electron  there is also no practical way of probing lengths that small   2  the simpler answer is really that although two black holes can supposedly be distinguished only by m  mass   j  spin   and q  charge   that does nt mean that any two objects with the same value of m  j  and q are indistinguishable all this means is that  if  we know both objects are black holes  then m  j  and q suffice as a characterization if the objects are not black holes  then we should not expect that to be enough ,d02fme8,askscience,learning,1455660386.0,Midtek,11.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

dark matter does nt reflect light because it does nt interact with light light interacts with electrically charged objects  or things like atoms which are made up of electrically charged objects   so dark matter does not have electric charge not every particle has to interact with every other kind of particle  we already know dark matter exists  because we can see the influence of dark matter on how things move through space  either as they go past galaxies  or as they move within galaxies  or as the galaxies themselves move we can see how much mass is tugging on things  compare that to how much mass we can actually see  and the difference is dark matter  and the various measurements all agree with each other in addition  the cosmic microwave background radiation lets us determine the amount of dark matter compared to the amount of visible matter  so there s confirmation there  too  gravitational waves are not likely to tell us much about dark matter this is discussed in  this recent thread   https  wwwredditcomrasksciencecomments45nzzydoes_the_discovery_of_gravitational_waves_mean  from raskscience ,d00z1fi,askscience,learning,1455564859.0,fishify,6.0,0.0,3,56629,0.0

from reading  gene switches are an upstream part of the dna that helps to regulate the transcription of that gene regulatory genes are proteins  or mirnas  that can potentially bind to these gene switches and activaterepress transcription of that gene  they may also coordinate the expression of multiple other genes through other mechanisms   hox genes are a specific  important class of regulatory genesthey are a family of transcription factors that activate genes important during development  http  wwwhhmiorgbiointeractivegeneswitch,d02l52l,askscience,learning,1455668739.0,fartprinceredux,3.0,0.0,2252,2706,0.0
hox is short for homeobox genes  which are a set of genes involved in limb formation and creating the embryonic body plan of many animals many hox genes are regulatory genes  which just means that they are genes whose products  mrna and proteins  increase or decrease the expression level of other genes gene switches is a new phrase to me  but i d guess it s referring to something like a promoter  which is a sequence of dna near a gene that another molecule has to bind to for the gene to be expressed so hox genes are a specific group of genes  regulatory genes are a general type of gene  and gene switches are  i think  the pieces of dna that regulatory genes act on to do their regulation ,d02l6mq,askscience,learning,1455668807.0,fencelizard,3.0,0.0,182,217,0.0

you re absolutely right that it has to do with the size of the ion  as a simple approximation  look at the equation for  electric potential energy   https  enwikipediaorgwikielectric_potential_energy   you can see that it depends on 1r  meaning that the closer you get to the charge  the stronger the interaction if you model an ion as a hard sphere with a charge at the center of it  not a terrible approximation   then any molecules with dipoles  like water  will be able to get closer and closer to the ion until they hit the edge of the sphere and can go no further  this means that the smaller your ion is  for a given amount of charge  the closer the water can get  and the stronger the interaction a stronger interaction with water means that in order for the ion to move  it has to  drag  more water with it  slowing it down  as your textbook pointed out ,d01rm1h,askscience,learning,1455619359.0,almightycuppa,3.0,0.0,2266,1252,0.0

if we assume that each shuffle is  perfect  in that each shuffle is just a randomly chosen permutation of the cards form the 52   8 x 10   67  possible permutations  then your question is exactly the same as the birthday problem  but with 52   days  instead of 365 days let p  nd  be the probability of there being at least one match among  n   people  in a year with  d   days   then if  n  is much smaller than  d   we have the approximation gt  p  nd   1  exp  n   2  2d  setting this equal to 05 and solving for  n  with  d   52  gives gt  n     d  log  4    1 x 10   34  so quite a lot of shuffles  having said all of that  when you physically shuffle a deck  you are not choosing a random permutation of cards for instance  people generally divide the deck into two roughly equal parts and then mix them together  roughly alternating cards from each smaller deck so a given card typically does not move more than a few positions from its current position in the deck of course  depending on your shuffling method  a card could possibly move many positions your question then has no general solution for one  we would need a lot more information on how exactly the cards are shuffled second  it is not immediately obvious whether every permutation of cards is achievable  let alone in a finite expected number of shuffles ,czzy5lr,askscience,learning,1455485735.0,Midtek,16.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0
this is a difficult question it depends a bit on what  shuffle  means shuffle s can not be organized or they d be predictable so by their nature they introduce randomness progressively through many progressions of pseudorandomness generated by the vague aspects of our capabilities to manipulate card using our hands more specifically if we could shuffle so each card fell exactly over the next card perfectly then the whole deck would be in its exact same order after some set number of shuffles i forget how many  however shuffles can be modeled the notion is that they will slowly grow away from their first organization and achieve perfect randomness that s quite a lot of shuffles before patterns are lost in the original deck  something like 11 still even then if the deck was perfectly random there is a chance that some cards are in exactly the same order with one of their adjacent cards  so what about the first card it is one of 52 cards its chance of being one of those 52 cards is 1 its chance of being adjacent to its next card is 151 its chance of lying beside a card that is nt its partner is 5051 the 2nd card has probably the same probability of not lying beside the 3rd as an original adjacent partner and through the deck the entire probability of having a deck with no original partners looks like  5051   51 or 36 equivalently its about 74  likely at least one card in a random deck is adjacent to its original partner  that may not answer your question  which i think might be rephrased as   how many times should i randomize a deck of cards if i want a 50  chance of finding two cards adjacent to an original partner  ,d00eb3m,askscience,learning,1455516478.0,bloonail,2.0,0.0,1,4242,0.0

this is because of the difference in the heat of moist air vs dry air  the equator receives the most sunlight of any area on earth quite a bit of this solar heating goes into evaporation of water  rather than raising the temperature itself  so the equator itself is a bit cooler than if the earth were bone dry  all this evaporation creates warm  moist air over the equatorial oceans  which begin rising and forming clouds this warm air deposits almost all of its moisture in clouds at equatorial regions  but the air itself continues rising that same air  now very dry  then begins to head in the direction of the poles  but is halted in its journey around  30 degrees latitude  the socalled  horse latitudes   as the coriolis force prevents it from moving more poleward it then proceeds to descend as very dry air around those same latitudes  eventually looping back closer to the surface to the equator  now all this dry descending air around the horse latitudes leads to a vast area of deserts at those locations in the northern hemisphere  there s the american southwest  the sahara  and the middle east in the southern hemisphere  there s the atacama desert in chile  the kalahari desert in namibia  and the australian outback obviously not everywhere at these latitudes is desert  since local currents can affect the area s climate  but deserts are the general trend  so why is it hotter there  it turns out that compressing dry air as it descends from high altitudes over these deserts will raise the temperature quite a bit more than the temperature decreased as it rose over the moist equator decompressing moist air in general  moist air changes temperature about 6 degrees c per km  while dry air changes about 10 degrees c per km this is because moist air recoups some of the heat lost to the original evaporation when that water vapor condenses as clouds as latest heat  so we start at 30 c over the equator and lift up the moist air to 3 km where clouds are formed  losing moisture as clouds  and the nowdry air is at 12 c the dry air then continues upwards up to about 10 km  where the additional 7 km of height decrease the temperature down to 58 c it travels poleward  when it then descends the 10 km as dry air over the horse latitudes  where it s now heated to 42 c  hotter than it originally was at the equator ,czzs2f8,askscience,learning,1455475284.0,Astromike23,66.0,0.0,975,48236,1.0

you re getting impulse mixed up with force impulse is how much force is applied over some time  a car hitting you has very large impulse  whereas a glacier has very small impulse but the force of a glacier is much more than a car it takes nothing more than a brick wall to stop a car  but sometimes not even mountains can stop glaciers you can say goodbye to nyc whenever a new iceage hits and glaciers become common in the northeast us  because one will pass through and totally obliterate everything ,d027onc,askscience,learning,1455649825.0,functor7,24.0,0.0,1151,26847,1.0
force is equal to mass x acceleration  but how much of that force is used to accelerate your body to the speed of the glacier  and over how long a time does the delta v take place  you appear to be thinking about impact here  and a slooow impact will do little damage to an unrestrained target ,d02qj8x,askscience,learning,1455676981.0,Eulerslist,1.0,0.0,1,776,0.0
the force in these cases is the force required to accelerate your own body from a stopped condition to match the speed of what s hitting you the glacier is moving slowly  so very little acceleration is required for your body to match its speed the car  however  is moving quickly so a very large force is required to accelerate your body ,d0284o0,askscience,learning,1455650426.0,Salsa_de_Pina,1.0,0.0,1,7267,0.0

why can we see lasers when they go through dense gases  and not with a naked eye   is it possible to change the colour of a laser by changing the gas you are using to see it ,463f5p,askscience,learning,1455642598.0,imaginarypiano,2.0,0.0,1355,1521,0.0
you certainly can see lasers with the naked eye  it s just very dangerous to look at them directly  because they can damage your retina irreparably  you need to think about the light coming out of a laser like a stream of bullets from a rifle they go completely straight  and once properly focused form a tight beam lasers can be made so that the diameter of the beam does nt change by more than fractions of an inch over miles of distance  just like you can stand off target from a rifle and not be hit by a bullet  you can stand beside a laser and not see the beam the photons have to hit your pupil for you to see the laser  assuming the laser is emitting visible light   normal light sources are like shot guns in comparison  the light flings out in all directions  though again  the can be focused  though not as well generally speaking   but again  you can only see the light if photons from that source hit your pupil and are focused onto your retina  so why can you see a laser when it goes through a mist  well to extend out rifle analogy  this is akin to firing the rifle into a concrete wall  and you get ricochets  which now might hit you anywhere when the laser photons hits the particles of mist they are refracted around  bending this way and that  each little droplet of mist is a little prism  and some of them get bent around until they fly into your eye  and then you can see them this is also why you can see lasers in dusty rooms  the little particles of dust are also prisms   you can change the colour of the laser light by the process of fluorescence here the fluorescent molecule absorbs light at one wavelength  but emits it at a very different wavelength this is not restricted to laser light this is what happens to your tshirt under  black light  aka uv light there are chemicals in the tshirt that absorb the uv light and emit light at a variety of wavelengths  appearing white ,d02i4yv,askscience,learning,1455663997.0,NeuroBill,5.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0
the visibility of the beam is mostly due to  mie scattering   https  enwikipediaorgwikimie_scattering   ie tiny particles  dust or liquid droplets  in air that are larger than the wavelength of the light it has no strong wavelength dependence  which is why fog  clouds  dust and smoke usually look greywhitish if you shine a laser through them it will just scatter in the same colour as the beam if you used dust particles of a peculiar material or shape  like quantum nano dots   you might be able to exploit a resonance  and a certain wavelength would be scattered more intensely    on a much weaker level you have reighley and raman scattering  where photons interact with individual moleculesatoms those have a strong material dependence  because here resonances matter   and can actively shift the spectrum of the scattered light but the cross section is much smaller than miescattering  for each moleculeatoms are way smaller than the typical piece of dust  so it s less likely to be hit by a photon reighley scattering is the process that turns the sky redblue at noonevening  but only after kilometres of atmosphere  even though these processes  and other higher order processes  are weak  people do use them in industrialresearch settings  to modify the spectrum of lasers by sending the beam through long gas filled fibers  they usually do nt care about the scattered part though they are rather interested in the transmitted part by shifting the wavelength of their source according to their needs     edit  another idea  if you not really want to scatter light  but just want it to look cool  you could create dust of some uvfluorescent dye  hopefully a not too toxic one  and use a uv laser the dust will scatter uv light  which you do nt care about  but the uv will also be partly absorbed by the dust and make it glow in various colours along the direction of the beam,d02jobo,askscience,learning,1455666380.0,giantsqueed,2.0,0.0,67,319,0.0

no  the blur you see underwater is caused by simple physics the focal point of a lens depends on the shape of the lens as well as the index of refraction inside and outside the lens when you go into water  your eye is suddenly surrounded by water  n  133  instead of air  n  1   so the image becomes blurry because the lens of your eye is now trying to make an image behind your retina instead of on top of it the same problem would be there for a fixed lens camera  the solution is pretty simple  make a lens with the right curvature to focus an image properly underwater we can design underwater cameras  and evolution can build underwater eyes sea animals have eyes that are shaped to work underwater  and would probably see a blurry image when they try to poke their heads into the air  of course  some animals need to see underwater and above water animals like the penguin what do they do  they have a lens that can be distorted much more than our our we have a flexible lens too  that is why we can focus on close or far objects but a penguin can change the focus even more so its lens can work in water or air ,d01wqjl,askscience,learning,1455633840.0,AugustusFink-nottle,21.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

leaving aside the specific question of dopamine and  feelgood chemicals   this could be regarded as a subset of the question  why does being alive as a human  or animal  feel like anything at all   this is a question to which there is no universally agreed answer people throw around terms like  qualia  and  epiphenomenon   but nobody has really answered the question to everybody s satisfaction  probably the most universally agreed view is that the brain and body together constitute a system that gathers  processes and responds to information the question is why that necessarily feels like anything at all none of the individual steps in that process seem to inherently require a feeling we can imagine individual neurons producing action potentials   firing   without any associated experience in fact it is hard to imagine that a single neuron  isolated in a dish and chemically triggered would have any kind of experience  what follows from that for most people is some sense that the  feeling  somehow emerges from the arrangement of the whole neural system  that it is somehow the sum of all the different processes occurring inside us  sometimes in harmony  sometimes in conflict  that gives rise to this feeling of being  in this view there is nothing inherently  feelgood  about any chemical what makes it a feelgood chemical is the pattern of activity it triggers in our brains in the case of neurotransmitters that are functioning correctly  the molecule is acting as a chemical bridge between two neurons giving off electrical signals  as part of  a pattern of activity associated with  good  outcomes  eg getting food  sex or social approval  or avoiding a negative outcome like injury   when functioning incorrectly  eg when release is artificially stimulated or simulated by ingested drugs  the  reward  pattern is being triggered without an actual external reward being present  but still  the question of why any of it feels like anything eludes us all we know for sure is that it does  and that there are unavoidable relationships between our brain activity and how we feel some hold that brain activity and mindfeeling are exactly the same thing  others that this makes no sense nobody has a complete answer that satisfies everyone else who is interested in the question ,czzglq7,askscience,learning,1455449199.0,theartificialkid,14.0,0.0,39,946,0.0
dopamine in particular is a neurotransmitter  it s a chemical message that neurons send to each other when they make computations happiness  as with all of your experiences  is a computation in your brain  your brain is integrating a bunch of inputs and saying that those inputs are good  and you experience this as happiness since happiness is just computation  and computation requires neurotransmission  happiness also requires neurotransmission  not all neurotransmitters are interchangeable some neurotransmitters send one message  some send another  and some send different messages based on the context of their transmission in addition  different neurons have different preferences for different neurotransmitters put all this together and you end up finding that some neurotransmitters are associated with particular kinds of computation  and in this way dopamine is associated with happiness  so it s not that dopamine makes you happy  it s that dopamine is an essential part of what happiness actually is  as a physical process in the brain ,czzda4z,askscience,learning,1455435642.0,Yoshanuikabundi,17.0,0.0,182,3575,0.0

i posted this on facebook last night  and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful   gravitational waves are one of the last major  unconfirmed predictions of general relativity  a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity general relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around they are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces  but because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism  we can see light all the time  just look around   while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly  absurdly  precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation rumors are flying that ligo  just such a system of lasers and detectors  has found a gravitational wave signal  probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other  because that s the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect   this would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there  rather than reveal something new and shocking about the universe think the higgs boson a few years ago it would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out  not  to be there  general relativity has worked extremely well so far  and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s  which won the 1993 nobel prize in physics ligo s  direct  detection would undoubtedly be nobelworthy  too  the only question is whether it would happen this year  this is exciting because a  it s direct  rather than indirect  confirmation that these things are there  and b  they ll open up a whole new window onto the universe pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation  from visible light to xrays  the ultraviolet  microwaves  what have you starting now we d have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos  delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes  so all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow  ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics or they could just be fucking with us ,czw1fgk,askscience,learning,1455202696.0,adamsolomon,848.0,0.0,279,37095,0.0

edit  haha  i work at mit and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed  they want to watch the announcements  as expected  there  s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread  so i  ll try to clear things up  amp  nbsp    what are gravitational waves    in order to understand gravitational waves  it  s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work we  ll first take a look at something more familiar  the electromagnetic field  note  this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook   the electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields  the electric field  e  and the magnetic field  b   the electric field is generated by particles with  electric charge   such as electrons  1 charge  and protons  1 charge   here  s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges  amp  nbsp  https  enwikipediaorgwikifile  vfpt_charges_plus_minus_thumbsvg amp  nbsp  as you can see in the picture  the convention is that electric field lines come  out  of positive charges and go  into  negative charges  if you already have an e field and you put a charge in it  the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation  from coulomb  s law   f  e  q where f is the force  e is the electric field  and q is the charge this force has a direction  for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines  for negative charges it points backwards  since q is negative   now  what does this have to do with gravitational waves  well  let me ask you the following question  what happens if i have 2 charges  a and b  far apart from each other  and i suddenly move charge a  1  the e field changes instantly  with charge b immediately  seeing  the new position of charge a  2  the e field changes first at charge a  and then the change propagates outward until charge b  sees  the change a while later  amp  nbsp  http  istackimgurcomga6fsgif amp  nbsp  as you can see  the answer is 2 changes in the electric field  radiate  outwards at a constant speed  the speed of light in fact  this radiation is light  our eyes are actually supersensitive eamp  b field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world  amp  nbsp  most importantly for our purposes  this principle of changes  radiating  outwards at the speed of light is   universal   for all fields and forces in the universe including gravity the caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the eamp  b fields  so you need to have incredibly   huge   masses moving around extremely violently  and incredibly   sensitive   detectors to pick up their movements  the biggest masses in our universe are black holes the most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other and ligo is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them  we  re almost done  the last question is  what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like  and as a corollary  why do black holes collide in the first place  well  most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems  systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes  still in orbit but why would they collide  why not just keep orbiting forever  well  massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves those waves carry energy  and that energy has to come from somewhere  in this case  it comes from the orbital energy so over a very long time  the orbits slowly collapse  the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other as this happens  the  orbital frequency  increases  the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter this is a universal principle of gravity  if you look at our solar system  you  ll see that mercury orbits much faster than earth  while pluto is much slower  so  as 2 black holes spiral towards each other  we expect to see a   chirp    gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity  rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge  amp  nbsp    what is ligo    even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves  the ripples produced are still incredibly weak  requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 11000th the diameter of a proton or less so a very amazing detector is required  ligo is basically an extremely sensitive distancemeasuring device  called an interferometer the way this works is the following  you start with a laser beam  then you split it into 2 equal beams  typically using a halfsilvered mirror that reflects 12 of the beam and lets the other 12 through  and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles when they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror when the beams return to you  you recombine them into a single beam and they  interfere   depending on how far each beam travelled  this interference can be either  destructive  or  constructive   meaning the beams can either cancel each other out  or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter  at ligo  they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive  meaning that no light arrives at their detector but  when a gravitational wave comes in  it distorts spacetime  changing the lengths of the beams  and they no longer perfectly cancel out  thus  a light signal appears at the detector  i strongly suggest you watch the following video  which has a good visual representation of the process  around 1  30   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rzzgfkoifqi amp  nbsp    why is this so damn exciting     so many reasons  the incredible technical achievement  measuring changes down to 1 part in 1000000000000000000000 the longawaited confirmation of gravitational waves  which is a huge deal in itself perhaps most of all  the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy  one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our universe  finally  this result gives us some confidence that we  ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the big bang  and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe  tl  dr  there are no real tl  drs in science  and why would you want one  it  s worth it to try and understand cool things

no  the blur you see underwater is caused by simple physics the focal point of a lens depends on the shape of the lens as well as the index of refraction inside and outside the lens when you go into water  your eye is suddenly surrounded by water  n  133  instead of air  n  1   so the image becomes blurry because the lens of your eye is now trying to make an image behind your retina instead of on top of it the same problem would be there for a fixed lens camera  the solution is pretty simple  make a lens with the right curvature to focus an image properly underwater we can design underwater cameras  and evolution can build underwater eyes sea animals have eyes that are shaped to work underwater  and would probably see a blurry image when they try to poke their heads into the air  of course  some animals need to see underwater and above water animals like the penguin what do they do  they have a lens that can be distorted much more than our our we have a flexible lens too  that is why we can focus on close or far objects but a penguin can change the focus even more so its lens can work in water or air ,d01wqjl,askscience,learning,1455633840.0,AugustusFink-nottle,21.0,0.0,42,10912,0.0

if you were to claim that something exceeded the speed of light  you would have to have  damn  good evidence even if we could nt explain how the neutrinos got to us before the supernova  it would just be an open problem to figure out  rather than evidence for them going faster than the speed of light nothing going faster than the speed of light is a law of physics just as important as the conservation of energy  we re not going to let a few neutrinos topple that we re not looking to find something that goes faster than the speed of light  because there s no way it would be consistent with anything else that we do know about the universe  but  we  can  explain the neutrinos because we know how supernovas work and we know that they spit out neutrinos before light has a chance to escape additionally  we know that neutrinos move slower than the speed of light due to them having mass as a result of  neutrino oscillation   https  enwikipediaorgwikineutrino_oscillation   which won the 2015 nobel prize ,d02ml7h,askscience,learning,1455670945.0,functor7,7.0,0.0,1151,26847,1.0

same thing with co2 the sublimation temp is when the vapor pressure of the solid is equal to atmospheric pressure but the melting point occurs at a higher pressure if you were to boil the substance at a higher pressure  the boiling point would now be at a higher temperature which would be the same or pretty close to the triple point  look at the phase diagram for co2   https  hubglobalccsinstitutecomsitesdefaultfilesimagecache620xhpublications7276advancedfig001jpg  to get a feel for how this works ,d025vbw,askscience,learning,1455647376.0,FoolishChemist,3.0,0.0,1609,30259,0.0

heat  and more specifically temperature  is a measure of kinetic energy  so the hotter something is  the higher the temperature and the faster the molecules are vibrating and moving in sulfur hexafluoride  the forces in between the molecules are nt enough to hold them together as a liquid before they rocket off  so it sublimes into a gas  another way to think about this is with water hydrogen bonds and vanderwaals forces hold water molecules together  and when it freezes  the molecules move slower  so the bonds get stronger and water becomes ice since sf6 does nt have hydrogen bonding and has weak intermolecular forces  it ca nt be held together after a certain point  so it never has an opportunity to become a liquid from a solid ,d024zzk,askscience,learning,1455646198.0,GonzoAndJohn,2.0,0.0,406,2767,0.0
sf6 is a solid at 1 atmosphere  or 1 bar  so boiling  does nt happen there since there is no liquid phase boiling  is a common term for liquidvapor equilibrium and sublimation  is the correct term for solidvapor equilibrium the vapor pressure of sf6 is above 1 bar  23 bar  at its triple point temperature of 496  c this is also the lowest pressure that you can talk about liquidsolid equilibrium  or melting as temperature is reduced further  the solidvapor equilibrium curve yields ever lower pressures when you move along that sublimation  curve  you eventually reach a sublimation pressure of 1 bar  at a temperature of 634  c so yes  the melting point   triple point  at 23 bar is indeed at a higher temperature  less negative  than the sublimation point temperature at 1 bar  but its not correct to refer to that point as boiling this is normal  however  for most substances  its just that the pressures are higher than atmospheric pressure ,d02ov5h,askscience,learning,1455674403.0,qwerty222,1.0,0.0,5745,1590,0.0

from reading  gene switches are an upstream part of the dna that helps to regulate the transcription of that gene regulatory genes are proteins  or mirnas  that can potentially bind to these gene switches and activaterepress transcription of that gene  they may also coordinate the expression of multiple other genes through other mechanisms   hox genes are a specific  important class of regulatory genesthey are a family of transcription factors that activate genes important during development  http  wwwhhmiorgbiointeractivegeneswitch,d02l52l,askscience,learning,1455668739.0,fartprinceredux,3.0,0.0,2252,2706,0.0
hox is short for homeobox genes  which are a set of genes involved in limb formation and creating the embryonic body plan of many animals many hox genes are regulatory genes  which just means that they are genes whose products  mrna and proteins  increase or decrease the expression level of other genes gene switches is a new phrase to me  but i d guess it s referring to something like a promoter  which is a sequence of dna near a gene that another molecule has to bind to for the gene to be expressed so hox genes are a specific group of genes  regulatory genes are a general type of gene  and gene switches are  i think  the pieces of dna that regulatory genes act on to do their regulation ,d02l6mq,askscience,learning,1455668807.0,fencelizard,3.0,0.0,182,217,0.0

eh  it depends on how you define  toxicity    the dose makes the poison   and as such nearly everything can be toxic the nature of life and how it utilizes chemistry means a lot of things which are very essential to life can also be very damaging to it  like  say  oxygen   but there is some truth to it if you come to the right definition of  toxic   which is really a biologyevolution question  elements and compounds which your evolutionary ancestors rarely or never had any exposure to _can_ very likely be extremely toxic because there are no evolved responses to their effects there has to be a sustained evolutionary pressure to develop and _maintain_ immunity to certain substances  and when it s not there there can be consequences  your body is nt a hyperspecialist though it can respond to novel compounds which are similar but unique well enough in many cases just because something is novel and synthetic does nt mean it s toxic  it all depends strongly on the situation ,d0168po,askscience,learning,1455575364.0,colechristensen,3.0,0.0,1030,13219,0.0
long story short  not really there is probably a weak correlation of some kind  no data   but in general  it wo nt matter at the practical end  first  the idea of an  element  being toxic is misleading take phosphorus for example it is very common  dna contains phosphorus   but white phosphorus  its  elemental  form  will kill you straighton similar can be said of oxygen  where its radical and ozone forms are toxic but o2 is not unless in extreme quantities and then there are cases like barium  somewhat abundant  but not so much in absolute terms   which is toxic in its ionic state  but you can still ingest barium sulphate because it just does nt dissolve in water  even in the stomach  second  toxicity depends not on the abundance of an element but on its properties  location on the periodic table can be a rough guide   xenon is very uncommon  but it is generally nontoxic because of its inertness gold is another case where it is nontoxic for the same reason but which is quite abundant on the other hand  aluminium  very common  is somewhat nontoxic only because the body has a good system to sequester and clear it once that system is compromised  aluminium can accumulate in the bone and cause problems  as often seen in people with kidney problems  third  different organisms have different need and tolerance for certain elements copper is toxic in small quantities to many organisms  but some need copper as part of haemocyanin there are marine animals that intentionally stock up on vanadium to become toxic to predators you can easily see here that the definition of  toxic  can be a bit subjective from here on  the idea that uncommon elements are toxic comes largely because they tend to be metals andor are radioactive in most isotope forms  not simply because of their rarity  again  it may have some influence  but is not a big factor   look at the really toxic ones they are either heavy metals  mercury  uranium  or undergo pretty quickdamaging radioactive decay  radon   correlation does not necessarily mean causation ,d018436,askscience,learning,1455578244.0,fush_n_chops,2.0,0.0,110,16650,0.0

i m not entirely sure exactly the situation you are talking about so i ll give a few answers  if you mean something like the moon  there are a few reasons first  it s very far away so for something that far away to move quickly across the eye  it would have to either be moving much much faster that s just a function of geometry however  there is an additional reason which is that we are better at perceiving relative velocity  how one object moves in relation to another  rather than absolute velocity so forgetting about the size of the object in the real world  if you just had a light that projected to the same area of your retina  same retinal size   then you would be worse at detecting its motion than if you had a second light on nearby as well by worse at detecting its motion  i mean that it would have to be moving faster before you would perceive it as moving than for the case where there are two objects i should also note that relative motion can be relative to a textured background  not necessarily relative to a second object  in general  it really is the case that larger objects  or several fragments grouped into a perceptual whole  are perceived to have a slower velocity than smaller or multiple objects  verghese and stone  1995   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepii0042698995000382    1996   http  visionarcnasagovpersonnelleepublicationsperceived_visual_speed_conpdf    1997   http  wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis0042698996001551    verghese and stone suggest that this is a function of scene segmentation this may also be due to motion pooling mechanisms your receptors at the level of the retina and in early visual cortex have relatively small receptive fields  they are detecting changes in contrast over time over a very small area of space subsequent visual areas  hmt  have to then pool that information to get a global motion percept cells in these areas have much larger receptive fields it is possible that there is some attenuation in the motion pooling  edit  a word,d011xd7,askscience,learning,1455569030.0,albasri,3.0,0.0,337,10662,1.0

crystal field theory approach  ligands are negative point charges that approach from an infinite distance to bind the metal cation in a metal atom with no ligands bound  the dorbitals are energydegenerate as ligands approach from the vertices of an octahedron  for example  they will  see  the dz2 and dx2dy2 orbitals more than  for example  the dxy orbital this will raise them in energy relative to the three orbitals that point between the ligands that the metal cation binds of course  the full model would have to consider electrostatic attractions between the positive center and negative ligands leading to lower energies all around as compared to what you would expect when these interactions are not considered  mo approach  orbitals on the ligands comparable in energy and in proper phase will mix with orbitals on the metal center to generate molecular orbitals when ligands bind at the vertices of an octahedron  they will  see  one or more dorbitals more than the other ones this will lead to linear combination of atomic orbitals to generate your molecular orbitals in a process similar to what you had to have learned in intro classes from this mixing  you d get a bonding and an antibonding orbital out and at this point it makes no sense to discuss  metal dorbitals  since they cease to exist instead  you have molecular orbitals which you d typically see classified by symmetry labels indicating degeneracy and multiplicity  think t2g  eg   these orbitals in fact are delocalized across several ligands and the simple  valence  model approaches its limit of usefulness the real picture is closer to this covalent model than a picture of charges or electrostatic interactions  note that this explanation does nt take into account pibackbonding and other second order effects that might change relative ordering of energy levels ,d024gqy,askscience,learning,1455645464.0,cheeseborito,6.0,0.0,1,7631,0.0

there are two answers to this question   1  a charged black hole  no spin  has 2 characteristic length scales  r  _s_   the schwarzschild radius  and r  _q_   no special name afaik   the black hole itself has two horizons  an outer event horizon and an inner socalled cauchy horizon if you cross the outer event horizon  you are doomed to keep falling inward toward the inner cauchy horizon  and then cross it into a region where you are then free to move around again as usual this region is very strange though it contains ctc s  closed timelike curves  and you can approach the singularity at the center as close as you want and then move away you can even then cross back through the cauchy horizon  after which you are doomed to keep falling outward  cross the event horizon  and then emerge in a topologically equivalent universe  not the same one though   it s a strange metric to say the least  if the charge of the black hole is large enough  the two horizons coincide  and if the charge is even larger than that  there are no horizons  this occurs when 2r  _q_  gt  r  _s_    the singularity at the center is naked  you can approach as close as you want  poke it with a stick  leave  and report your findings to someone else the black hole is said to be superextremal  if you work out r  _q_  and r  _s_  for an electron  treating it as a black hole  you find that the electron would have to be superextremal in other words  the electron  if it were a charged  nonspinning black hole  would be a naked singularity there are some discussions in the literature about what a  black hole electron  would mean  and i think there is even a wikipedia page on it afaik  a black hole electron is consistent with gr and qft part of the problem of verifying such a claim is that the value of r  _q_  is like 10   37  m and r  _s_  is like 10   57  m both length scales are orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length so a full quantum theory of gravity would be necessary to describe the black hole electron  there is also no practical way of probing lengths that small   2  the simpler answer is really that although two black holes can supposedly be distinguished only by m  mass   j  spin   and q  charge   that does nt mean that any two objects with the same value of m  j  and q are indistinguishable all this means is that  if  we know both objects are black holes  then m  j  and q suffice as a characterization if the objects are not black holes  then we should not expect that to be enough ,d02fme8,askscience,learning,1455660386.0,Midtek,11.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

theoretically  this is absolutely possible you take an opsin protein from another species  or one engineered to respond to a specific wavelength  you find out it s genetic code  you package it with a correct promoter into an appropriate virus  and you inject it into the eye in theory  it is something we could do right now  and there are labs doing similar things in mice as we speak  in practice there are some significant issues the first is you only want the the gene to be expressed in rodscones and not in all the other neurons in your retina there are ways around this  i  think  using an appropriate promoter might help  but i m not so sure i m not an expert on molecular biology there theoretically could be problems with your body recognizing the foreign protein as an antigen  but my understanding is that this is nt that much of a problem in reality  i think the final issue is the most interesting what are you going to see  let s say you make your eye respond to infrared what are you going to see when you look at something emitting bright infrared  well  if we ve made your red cones express this foreign opsin protein  you re going to see red  if green cones  green blue cones  blue  or all of them  white your phone has reg green and blue sensors too point it at your tv remote  which emits infrared  and press some buttons  you ll see a dark or whitest purple it s the same situation without a special neural pathway to deal with this new information  you can only piggyback on what is there  and no  we do not know how to create a new neural pathway which would allow people to see a new color  there are some other problems  like uv does nt penetrate the medium of the eye  focusing wavelengths far from visual would cause trouble  but you would still be able to sense them  if not resolve them properly  if they were of enough power ,d01bium,askscience,learning,1455583728.0,NeuroBill,9.0,0.0,216,8073,0.0

the best way to do it is with an external sensor  eg an ir camera  that translates an invisible image into a visible image  on a nonliteral color display   you could  in principle  change the receptivity of the retina by replacing the photopigments with something else  most earthly creatures have pigments that cover a similar range as ours  maybe a little uv here and there  but not a huge difference   but then there s a much bigger problem  which is that the optics of the eye are suited only for a narrow range of visible light there s something called  chromatic aberration   where different wavelengths are refracted differently through a given medium  with the eye as it is  the short and longwavelength portions of a natural  visiblelight image can not be simultaneously focused  so if you expand the range of visible wavelengths  image quality will get worse and worse  so even if you did replace the photopigments  you would have to make further changes to optical structure of the eye  and then you d lose your ability to focus the old  visible light  images if you re going to replace virtually the whole organ  why not just use an electronic device at the front end ,d02cz8l,askscience,learning,1455656865.0,aggasalk,2.0,0.0,125,10643,1.0

this is because of the difference in the heat of moist air vs dry air  the equator receives the most sunlight of any area on earth quite a bit of this solar heating goes into evaporation of water  rather than raising the temperature itself  so the equator itself is a bit cooler than if the earth were bone dry  all this evaporation creates warm  moist air over the equatorial oceans  which begin rising and forming clouds this warm air deposits almost all of its moisture in clouds at equatorial regions  but the air itself continues rising that same air  now very dry  then begins to head in the direction of the poles  but is halted in its journey around  30 degrees latitude  the socalled  horse latitudes   as the coriolis force prevents it from moving more poleward it then proceeds to descend as very dry air around those same latitudes  eventually looping back closer to the surface to the equator  now all this dry descending air around the horse latitudes leads to a vast area of deserts at those locations in the northern hemisphere  there s the american southwest  the sahara  and the middle east in the southern hemisphere  there s the atacama desert in chile  the kalahari desert in namibia  and the australian outback obviously not everywhere at these latitudes is desert  since local currents can affect the area s climate  but deserts are the general trend  so why is it hotter there  it turns out that compressing dry air as it descends from high altitudes over these deserts will raise the temperature quite a bit more than the temperature decreased as it rose over the moist equator decompressing moist air in general  moist air changes temperature about 6 degrees c per km  while dry air changes about 10 degrees c per km this is because moist air recoups some of the heat lost to the original evaporation when that water vapor condenses as clouds as latest heat  so we start at 30 c over the equator and lift up the moist air to 3 km where clouds are formed  losing moisture as clouds  and the nowdry air is at 12 c the dry air then continues upwards up to about 10 km  where the additional 7 km of height decrease the temperature down to 58 c it travels poleward  when it then descends the 10 km as dry air over the horse latitudes  where it s now heated to 42 c  hotter than it originally was at the equator ,czzs2f8,askscience,learning,1455475284.0,Astromike23,66.0,0.0,975,48236,1.0

the magic of bonding to enamel is because of a process called  acid etching   http  wwwslidesharenetmahmoudmohsinacidetchingofenamelandbondstrength   not because there is anything special in the adhesive used slide  5 of this presentation shows a microscopic view of enamel following treatment with an acid etch the material inside these tiny tubules is dissolved by the acid which then allows the composite adhesive to flow into these irregularities the adhesive is formulated with a light curing initiator so that when a certain spectrum of blue light hits the composite  the liquid adhesive becomes hard so basically the bond of the adhesive to the enamel is a mechanical lock the bracket also has a rough surface that allows for a mechanical lock  this same  bonding process   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  q_fhmesa2rcis  used by dentists to adhere fillings and porcelain veneers for bonding orthodontic brackets you apply a small dab of acid etch gel  usually colored blue  to the center of the tooth for about 1530 seconds and then you rinse it off dry the enamel then has a chalky appearance that is different from the shiny appearance of unetched enamel you apply the liquid adhesive and hold a curing light  blue spectrum  over the area and the liquid instantly cures and becomes hard  if after the etching process  the enamel is contaminated with saliva  salivary proteins will flow into some of those tubules and create a weak bond you know a bond was contaminated when you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off and you see no adhesive stuck on the tooth and it s all on the bracket other times  you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off with most of the adhesive on the tooth and none on the bracket and this is because the patient chewed ice or something else hard that exceeded the tensile strength of the adhesive  when braces need to be removed  there are special tools that grab the bracket and cleave the mechanical bond  which usually leaves a blob of composite on the enamel  but sometimes leaves a blob of composite attached to the bracket the blob of composite on the enamel is then removed with sharp chisel like instruments and smoothed with very fine burs  i had a patient in braces one time and they just disappeared we could nt get hold of her and did nt see her for two years we finally located her and realized that she had removed the braces herself  she also dropped out of school and had a baby  with pliers fortunately she did nt damage the enamel anywhere and she was able to get the brackets off  but each tooth had a blob of rough composite in the center which i then smoothed away ,d01t4pv,askscience,learning,1455625161.0,veritasius,38.0,0.0,3222,6487,0.0
first of all acid etching does not permanently hurt the enamel products like mi paste and can help rebuild the tooth surface also this is happening at a extremely small level and is essentially unnoticeable i would recommend that you take extra care during orthodontic treatment due to the physical obstructions that trap food and can lead to decay ,d01zor4,askscience,learning,1455638720.0,timjroc,2.0,0.0,164,39,0.0

ah yes  a teachable moment in dynamic content  what happens when your browser loads an image link from a webpage is that it makes a connection to the server  which it figures out from the url  then it sends the url to the server and says  hey  do you have this file  could you send it to me   and then the server can send back that image file  if it decides it has it  but here s the important part of this whole thing  what exactly happens on the server in between getting the request and sending back the file  the answer is  anything the server wants to do anything  the server could check for files under the appropriate local filesystem directory path and then read that from disk and return it the server could instead decide to query a database for a matching filesystem path and then return the data stored in the database or  the server could dynamically generate an image file that is unique to each requestor which means that the server can make an image that show s everyone their own ip address  for example or  the server could return random images to everyone or  the server could show everyone the same image except for one person who gets a different image  for whatever reason  there are some interesting lessons from this first is that what you see when viewing a page may not be the same as what someone else sees usually it s too much work to go to the effort to handtailor different images and content for different users  but it should nt be ruled out another is that every webserver that s serving you an image has your ip address and can log your access to that file that means  if a scammer or attacker sends you a spam email or link they could easily verify your email address and collect your ip by using embedded images  if you allow them to be shown ,d01qugd,askscience,learning,1455616148.0,rocketsocks,2.0,0.0,500,85150,1.0

from reading  gene switches are an upstream part of the dna that helps to regulate the transcription of that gene regulatory genes are proteins  or mirnas  that can potentially bind to these gene switches and activaterepress transcription of that gene  they may also coordinate the expression of multiple other genes through other mechanisms   hox genes are a specific  important class of regulatory genesthey are a family of transcription factors that activate genes important during development  http  wwwhhmiorgbiointeractivegeneswitch,d02l52l,askscience,learning,1455668739.0,fartprinceredux,3.0,0.0,2252,2706,0.0

it is rather difficult for me not to give an advanced answer to your question the best intuition i can give is the following  suppose the spatial universe had positive curvature  instead of zero curvature  which is a flat universe   the prototypical example of a surface of positive curvature everywhere is a sphere the positive curvature means that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always more than 180 degrees  for instance if a space has positive curvature  it has to curve back in on itself to create that  convex  shape of the sphere so the space ends up having to  close up   which means it ends up being finite  there is a general mathematical theorem that states that any complete  riemannian manifold with positive  boundedbelow curvature must be compact it s not an easy theorem  if the curvature is zero everywhere  then the space can just spread out and does nt have to close in on itself so if it never closes up  it just goes on forever  and the space is infinite   the problem with this intuitive picture is that it s a bit wrong the part about a positive curvature space having to be finite is true the part about a zero curvature space having to be infinite is not true a zero curvature space  can  be infinite  but it can also do some odd things like repeat itself  while maintaining the flatness so this just begs the question why then must a flat universe be infinite     edit    to match the edit below it turns out that if space is flat  and  finite  then it must not be isotropic  which means that it does nt look the same in all directions but that statement is mathematically highly nontrivial  to answer that  i have to resort to some more advanced math    warning   some technical and mathematical language ahead someone else might come along to give a more accessible explanation of why flat   gt  infinite until then  requests for clarification are welcome   in the robertstonwalker cosmology  there are three possibilities for the  constant  spatial curvature  the curvature of hypersurfaces of constant cosmological time   determined by the sign of the curvature  positive  zero  or negative   3spaces of constant zero curvature  ie  a flat universe  come in essentially two types   e   3   which is just euclidean space this is a noncompact manifold   s   1  x s   1  x s   1   or the 3torus this is a periodic  compact manifold in this type of universe  you can head out in some direction and eventually come back to your exact starting point the spatial universe is finite  each of these spaces could  in principle  be the topology of the  spatial  universe but we usually rule out the 3torus either because it is periodic or because it is not simply connected  off the top of my head  i can not think of any feasible experimental way to rule out a nonsimplyconnected universe though     edit    oops  forgot to mention that the 3torus is also not  isotropic   which more or less means that space should look the same in all directions  so all that is left is e   3  if the universe is flat  whence the universe must also be infinite   there are  other  3spaces of constant zero curvature for instance  s   1  x k  where k is a klein bottle however  all other spaces that i did not list above are  nonorientable   which then must necessarily also be nonsimplyconnected   so if we do nt rule out a topology for not being simply connected  we would almost certainly rule it out for not being orientable a nonorientable space seems rather nonphysical  it turns out though that there are other deeper reasons to rule out spacetimes that are not spaceorientable it is believed that all interactions are invariant under simultaneous reversal of charge  parity  and time  cptinvariance    a formal statement of the theorem can be proved under some natural conditions  since weak interactions are not cpinvariant  it follows that in going around a closed curve in spacetime  either the sign of charge  the orientation of spacelike axes  and the orientation of time must all reverse  or none of them reverse  which follows from cptinvariance   hence a spacetime is timeorientable if and only if it is also spaceorientable  the question of spaceorientability then becomes one of timeorientability there are examples of spacetimes that are not timeorientable  but the idea of time nonorientability seems even less natural than that of space nonorientability  interestingly  if a spacetime is not timeorientable  it has a double covering space which  is  timeorientable  a spacetime that is not timeorientable presents the same sort of problems that closed timelike curves present  ie  time travel  because there would be closed curves that reverse the time orientation  and so would be able to reinterpret certain events as having occurred in the reverse order you end up getting the same sort of grandfather paradoxes that you hear about when time travel is brought up so we have  very strong  reasons to believe that our universe is timeorientable  which then means  by cptinvariance  that the universe is also spaceorientable ,d00bep2,askscience,learning,1455509918.0,Midtek,65.0,0.0,1,25354,1.0

the main feature of the ether is that it created a universal reference frame as the medium in which light traveled in order for it to work it had to be possible to tell how fast you were moving with respect to the ether  for example by comparing the speed of light rays traveling in different directions with respect to yourself  the fact that it was a field that permeates the universe was not the fact that was disproven  and indeed all of modern particle physics is based on the idea that fields permeate the universe none of these fields  however  have the property that they create a preferred reference frame it is never possible to do an experiment that tells you how fast you are moving with respect to the higgs field  for example ,czzmt5q,askscience,learning,1455466184.0,Sirkkus,358.0,0.0,193,12855,0.0

the order of operations is nothing more than human notation  11  2  right  but that s just a bunch of symbols they do nt  mean  anything on their own it s just lines on paper  or a screen   the point is that we simply all agree on the fact that  1  and  2  represent numbers of a certain value  that    means we are adding the values on either side of the symbol  and that    means everything on the left has the same value as everything on the right it s just notation humans have created to make communication and record keeping easier  the same thing is true for the order of operations for example  we say 11   5  6 while  11    5  10 in the first case we say multiplication comes before addition in the second case we say parenthesis comes before multiplication but that s only true because mankind has agreed that s how we want to do things if we  did nt  have the order of operations then people would disagree on how to solve 11   5 it would be confusing some people would do the addition first and some people would do the multiplication first there would be no rules  and people would get different answers for the same problem  if the whole point of writing math down is to keep track of our work and communicate mathematical ideas with other people  then we need to use a consistent  language  that everyone knows how to interpret the order of operations is just part of the  math language  that mankind has invented  we  could   for example  use different rules maybe we want to change and just say that math should always be done left to right  no matter what the operations are so 11   5 and  11    5 would both be equal to 10 we could have gone that way in an alternate universe perhaps  the nice thing about using the  order of operations  is that it allows us to be more flexible going left to right means everything has to be in a very rigid order using parenthesis allows us to mix things up more without them we would also need some new ways to write certain problems for example  there would be no good way to write something like  11    12   the answer is 23 but if you re going lefttoright only  there s no way to explain how  12  is supposed to be the denominator of the whole thing ,d014q32,askscience,learning,1455573082.0,jofwu,3.0,0.0,1213,21889,0.0

the magic of bonding to enamel is because of a process called  acid etching   http  wwwslidesharenetmahmoudmohsinacidetchingofenamelandbondstrength   not because there is anything special in the adhesive used slide  5 of this presentation shows a microscopic view of enamel following treatment with an acid etch the material inside these tiny tubules is dissolved by the acid which then allows the composite adhesive to flow into these irregularities the adhesive is formulated with a light curing initiator so that when a certain spectrum of blue light hits the composite  the liquid adhesive becomes hard so basically the bond of the adhesive to the enamel is a mechanical lock the bracket also has a rough surface that allows for a mechanical lock  this same  bonding process   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  q_fhmesa2rcis  used by dentists to adhere fillings and porcelain veneers for bonding orthodontic brackets you apply a small dab of acid etch gel  usually colored blue  to the center of the tooth for about 1530 seconds and then you rinse it off dry the enamel then has a chalky appearance that is different from the shiny appearance of unetched enamel you apply the liquid adhesive and hold a curing light  blue spectrum  over the area and the liquid instantly cures and becomes hard  if after the etching process  the enamel is contaminated with saliva  salivary proteins will flow into some of those tubules and create a weak bond you know a bond was contaminated when you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off and you see no adhesive stuck on the tooth and it s all on the bracket other times  you see an orthodontic bracket that has come off with most of the adhesive on the tooth and none on the bracket and this is because the patient chewed ice or something else hard that exceeded the tensile strength of the adhesive  when braces need to be removed  there are special tools that grab the bracket and cleave the mechanical bond  which usually leaves a blob of composite on the enamel  but sometimes leaves a blob of composite attached to the bracket the blob of composite on the enamel is then removed with sharp chisel like instruments and smoothed with very fine burs  i had a patient in braces one time and they just disappeared we could nt get hold of her and did nt see her for two years we finally located her and realized that she had removed the braces herself  she also dropped out of school and had a baby  with pliers fortunately she did nt damage the enamel anywhere and she was able to get the brackets off  but each tooth had a blob of rough composite in the center which i then smoothed away ,d01t4pv,askscience,learning,1455625161.0,veritasius,38.0,0.0,3222,6487,0.0
first of all acid etching does not permanently hurt the enamel products like mi paste and can help rebuild the tooth surface also this is happening at a extremely small level and is essentially unnoticeable i would recommend that you take extra care during orthodontic treatment due to the physical obstructions that trap food and can lead to decay ,d01zor4,askscience,learning,1455638720.0,timjroc,2.0,0.0,164,39,0.0

gt  temperature is dependent on the average kinetic energy of matter this is false  it s a common highschool mantra that is not true in general  generally it is meant the temperature of the cmbr the cmbr has a thermal spectrum  is in thermal equilibrium and thus has a definite temperature of 27 k it looks like radiation emitted by a blackbody at that temperature the reason is this background was actually emitted by the dense gas filling the early universe at a much higher temperature at the moment it became transparent  then the subsequent expansion of the universe cooled it to the current value photons are sort of magical in that the expansion of space mantains them at thermal equilibrium  even though they do nt interact and could nt reach equilibrium on their own  but lowers the temperature as the wavelengths are stretched ,d01pajv,askscience,learning,1455610237.0,rantonels,3.0,0.0,2112,24440,1.0
the vacuum itself has no temperature the 27 kelvin you often hear about is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background it is a photon gas at thermal equilibrium  so it has some temperature  some pressure  some entropy  etc  there is also a cosmic neutrino background with its own temperature  slightly lower than that of the cmb the reason why their temperatures are not the same is that neutrinos do nt interact much with light  so there is no way for the photon and neutrino gases to exchange energy and reach thermal equilibrium ,d01tire,askscience,learning,1455626360.0,RobusEtCeleritas,3.0,0.0,1,36126,0.0

i posted this on facebook last night  and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful   gravitational waves are one of the last major  unconfirmed predictions of general relativity  a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity general relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around they are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces  but because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism  we can see light all the time  just look around   while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly  absurdly  precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation rumors are flying that ligo  just such a system of lasers and detectors  has found a gravitational wave signal  probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other  because that s the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect   this would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there  rather than reveal something new and shocking about the universe think the higgs boson a few years ago it would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out  not  to be there  general relativity has worked extremely well so far  and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s  which won the 1993 nobel prize in physics ligo s  direct  detection would undoubtedly be nobelworthy  too  the only question is whether it would happen this year  this is exciting because a  it s direct  rather than indirect  confirmation that these things are there  and b  they ll open up a whole new window onto the universe pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation  from visible light to xrays  the ultraviolet  microwaves  what have you starting now we d have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos  delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes  so all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow  ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics or they could just be fucking with us ,czw1fgk,askscience,learning,1455202696.0,adamsolomon,848.0,0.0,279,37095,0.0

edit  haha  i work at mit and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed  they want to watch the announcements  as expected  there  s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread  so i  ll try to clear things up  amp  nbsp    what are gravitational waves    in order to understand gravitational waves  it  s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work we  ll first take a look at something more familiar  the electromagnetic field  note  this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook   the electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields  the electric field  e  and the magnetic field  b   the electric field is generated by particles with  electric charge   such as electrons  1 charge  and protons  1 charge   here  s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges  amp  nbsp  https  enwikipediaorgwikifile  vfpt_charges_plus_minus_thumbsvg amp  nbsp  as you can see in the picture  the convention is that electric field lines come  out  of positive charges and go  into  negative charges  if you already have an e field and you put a charge in it  the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation  from coulomb  s law   f  e  q where f is the force  e is the electric field  and q is the charge this force has a direction  for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines  for negative charges it points backwards  since q is negative   now  what does this have to do with gravitational waves  well  let me ask you the following question  what happens if i have 2 charges  a and b  far apart from each other  and i suddenly move charge a  1  the e field changes instantly  with charge b immediately  seeing  the new position of charge a  2  the e field changes first at charge a  and then the change propagates outward until charge b  sees  the change a while later  amp  nbsp  http  istackimgurcomga6fsgif amp  nbsp  as you can see  the answer is 2 changes in the electric field  radiate  outwards at a constant speed  the speed of light in fact  this radiation is light  our eyes are actually supersensitive eamp  b field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world  amp  nbsp  most importantly for our purposes  this principle of changes  radiating  outwards at the speed of light is   universal   for all fields and forces in the universe including gravity the caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the eamp  b fields  so you need to have incredibly   huge   masses moving around extremely violently  and incredibly   sensitive   detectors to pick up their movements  the biggest masses in our universe are black holes the most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other and ligo is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them  we  re almost done  the last question is  what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like  and as a corollary  why do black holes collide in the first place  well  most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems  systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes  still in orbit but why would they collide  why not just keep orbiting forever  well  massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves those waves carry energy  and that energy has to come from somewhere  in this case  it comes from the orbital energy so over a very long time  the orbits slowly collapse  the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other as this happens  the  orbital frequency  increases  the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter this is a universal principle of gravity  if you look at our solar system  you  ll see that mercury orbits much faster than earth  while pluto is much slower  so  as 2 black holes spiral towards each other  we expect to see a   chirp    gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity  rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge  amp  nbsp    what is ligo    even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves  the ripples produced are still incredibly weak  requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 11000th the diameter of a proton or less so a very amazing detector is required  ligo is basically an extremely sensitive distancemeasuring device  called an interferometer the way this works is the following  you start with a laser beam  then you split it into 2 equal beams  typically using a halfsilvered mirror that reflects 12 of the beam and lets the other 12 through  and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles when they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror when the beams return to you  you recombine them into a single beam and they  interfere   depending on how far each beam travelled  this interference can be either  destructive  or  constructive   meaning the beams can either cancel each other out  or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter  at ligo  they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive  meaning that no light arrives at their detector but  when a gravitational wave comes in  it distorts spacetime  changing the lengths of the beams  and they no longer perfectly cancel out  thus  a light signal appears at the detector  i strongly suggest you watch the following video  which has a good visual representation of the process  around 1  30   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rzzgfkoifqi amp  nbsp    why is this so damn exciting     so many reasons  the incredible technical achievement  measuring changes down to 1 part in 1000000000000000000000 the longawaited confirmation of gravitational waves  which is a huge deal in itself perhaps most of all  the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy  one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our universe  finally  this result gives us some confidence that we  ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the big bang  and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe  tl  dr  there are no real tl  drs in science  and why would you want one  it  s worth it to try and understand cool things

well firstly  gravity is nt a wave  but there can be waves in the gravity field meaning changes in gravity are sent via waves  but even without those waves there is still a gravitational pull  interpreting your question loosely however  yes this does work and we ve known this for a long time  https  enwikipediaorgwikishell_theorem shell theorem is one example  whereby inside the shell the force of gravity is canceled out  the downside of course is that the only way we know to create an equalbutopposite source of gravity is by having the equivalent amount of mass  so if we wanted to  cancel  the earth s gravity  we would need something with the mass of the earth this of course would only really cancel out for an instant  before it smashed into the earth and obliterated the world as we know it  so basically  no  it wo nt be useful for  canceling  gravity ,d02c67v,askscience,learning,1455655774.0,Daegs,3.0,0.0,139,10054,0.0
yes if something is moving towards and away from you thereby increasing and decreasing its gravitational pull  and something closer to you moves in the opposite direction it can cancel it out that way  you d just feel a constant gravity  if you re asking if you can turn off gravity  rather than just get rid of the waves  then no you d need something with the opposite gravitational field  and barring some kind of exotic matter with negative mass  that s not going to happen ,d02dg1m,askscience,learning,1455657488.0,DCarrier,2.0,0.0,78,26948,0.0

dark matter does nt reflect light because it does nt interact with light light interacts with electrically charged objects  or things like atoms which are made up of electrically charged objects   so dark matter does not have electric charge not every particle has to interact with every other kind of particle  we already know dark matter exists  because we can see the influence of dark matter on how things move through space  either as they go past galaxies  or as they move within galaxies  or as the galaxies themselves move we can see how much mass is tugging on things  compare that to how much mass we can actually see  and the difference is dark matter  and the various measurements all agree with each other in addition  the cosmic microwave background radiation lets us determine the amount of dark matter compared to the amount of visible matter  so there s confirmation there  too  gravitational waves are not likely to tell us much about dark matter this is discussed in  this recent thread   https  wwwredditcomrasksciencecomments45nzzydoes_the_discovery_of_gravitational_waves_mean  from raskscience ,d00z1fi,askscience,learning,1455564859.0,fishify,6.0,0.0,3,56629,0.0

leaving aside the specific question of dopamine and  feelgood chemicals   this could be regarded as a subset of the question  why does being alive as a human  or animal  feel like anything at all   this is a question to which there is no universally agreed answer people throw around terms like  qualia  and  epiphenomenon   but nobody has really answered the question to everybody s satisfaction  probably the most universally agreed view is that the brain and body together constitute a system that gathers  processes and responds to information the question is why that necessarily feels like anything at all none of the individual steps in that process seem to inherently require a feeling we can imagine individual neurons producing action potentials   firing   without any associated experience in fact it is hard to imagine that a single neuron  isolated in a dish and chemically triggered would have any kind of experience  what follows from that for most people is some sense that the  feeling  somehow emerges from the arrangement of the whole neural system  that it is somehow the sum of all the different processes occurring inside us  sometimes in harmony  sometimes in conflict  that gives rise to this feeling of being  in this view there is nothing inherently  feelgood  about any chemical what makes it a feelgood chemical is the pattern of activity it triggers in our brains in the case of neurotransmitters that are functioning correctly  the molecule is acting as a chemical bridge between two neurons giving off electrical signals  as part of  a pattern of activity associated with  good  outcomes  eg getting food  sex or social approval  or avoiding a negative outcome like injury   when functioning incorrectly  eg when release is artificially stimulated or simulated by ingested drugs  the  reward  pattern is being triggered without an actual external reward being present  but still  the question of why any of it feels like anything eludes us all we know for sure is that it does  and that there are unavoidable relationships between our brain activity and how we feel some hold that brain activity and mindfeeling are exactly the same thing  others that this makes no sense nobody has a complete answer that satisfies everyone else who is interested in the question ,czzglq7,askscience,learning,1455449199.0,theartificialkid,14.0,0.0,39,946,0.0
dopamine in particular is a neurotransmitter  it s a chemical message that neurons send to each other when they make computations happiness  as with all of your experiences  is a computation in your brain  your brain is integrating a bunch of inputs and saying that those inputs are good  and you experience this as happiness since happiness is just computation  and computation requires neurotransmission  happiness also requires neurotransmission  not all neurotransmitters are interchangeable some neurotransmitters send one message  some send another  and some send different messages based on the context of their transmission in addition  different neurons have different preferences for different neurotransmitters put all this together and you end up finding that some neurotransmitters are associated with particular kinds of computation  and in this way dopamine is associated with happiness  so it s not that dopamine makes you happy  it s that dopamine is an essential part of what happiness actually is  as a physical process in the brain ,czzda4z,askscience,learning,1455435642.0,Yoshanuikabundi,17.0,0.0,182,3575,0.0

i posted this on facebook last night  and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful   gravitational waves are one of the last major  unconfirmed predictions of general relativity  a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity general relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around they are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces  but because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism  we can see light all the time  just look around   while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly  absurdly  precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation rumors are flying that ligo  just such a system of lasers and detectors  has found a gravitational wave signal  probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other  because that s the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect   this would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there  rather than reveal something new and shocking about the universe think the higgs boson a few years ago it would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out  not  to be there  general relativity has worked extremely well so far  and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s  which won the 1993 nobel prize in physics ligo s  direct  detection would undoubtedly be nobelworthy  too  the only question is whether it would happen this year  this is exciting because a  it s direct  rather than indirect  confirmation that these things are there  and b  they ll open up a whole new window onto the universe pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation  from visible light to xrays  the ultraviolet  microwaves  what have you starting now we d have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos  delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes  so all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow  ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics or they could just be fucking with us ,czw1fgk,askscience,learning,1455202696.0,adamsolomon,848.0,0.0,279,37095,0.0
gt  for more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves  see here  wow  i did nt expect the gravitational waves to have such large wavelengths for some reason  does that man that ligo is looking for waves a frequency on the order of 100hz  and that future detectors will be looking at frequencies measured in minutes  hours  and days  and that some of those waves in the cmb end of the spectrum have had only a few full oscillations since they were created ,czw1bxs,askscience,learning,1455202529.0,TheFeshy,39.0,0.0,734,65099,0.0
edit  haha  i work at mit and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed  they want to watch the announcements  as expected  there  s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread  so i  ll try to clear things up  amp  nbsp    what are gravitational waves    in order to understand gravitational waves  it  s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work we  ll first take a look at something more familiar  the electromagnetic field  note  this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook   the electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields  the electric field  e  and the magnetic field  b   the electric field is generated by particles with  electric charge   such as electrons  1 charge  and protons  1 charge   here  s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges  amp  nbsp  https  enwikipediaorgwikifile  vfpt_charges_plus_minus_thumbsvg amp  nbsp  as you can see in the picture  the convention is that electric field lines come  out  of positive charges and go  into  negative charges  if you already have an e field and you put a charge in it  the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation  from coulomb  s law   f  e  q where f is the force  e is the electric field  and q is the charge this force has a direction  for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines  for negative charges it points backwards  since q is negative   now  what does this have to do with gravitational waves  well  let me ask you the following question  what happens if i have 2 charges  a and b  far apart from each other  and i suddenly move charge a  1  the e field changes instantly  with charge b immediately  seeing  the new position of charge a  2  the e field changes first at charge a  and then the change propagates outward until charge b  sees  the change a while later  amp  nbsp  http  istackimgurcomga6fsgif amp  nbsp  as you can see  the answer is 2 changes in the electric field  radiate  outwards at a constant speed  the speed of light in fact  this radiation is light  our eyes are actually supersensitive eamp  b field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world  amp  nbsp  most importantly for our purposes  this principle of changes  radiating  outwards at the speed of light is   universal   for all fields and forces in the universe including gravity the caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the eamp  b fields  so you need to have incredibly   huge   masses moving around extremely violently  and incredibly   sensitive   detectors to pick up their movements  the biggest masses in our universe are black holes the most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other and ligo is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them  we  re almost done  the last question is  what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like  and as a corollary  why do black holes collide in the first place  well  most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems  systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes  still in orbit but why would they collide  why not just keep orbiting forever  well  massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves those waves carry energy  and that energy has to come from somewhere  in this case  it comes from the orbital energy so over a very long time  the orbits slowly collapse  the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other as this happens  the  orbital frequency  increases  the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter this is a universal principle of gravity  if you look at our solar system  you  ll see that mercury orbits much faster than earth  while pluto is much slower  so  as 2 black holes spiral towards each other  we expect to see a   chirp    gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity  rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge  amp  nbsp    what is ligo    even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves  the ripples produced are still incredibly weak  requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 11000th the diameter of a proton or less so a very amazing detector is required  ligo is basically an extremely sensitive distancemeasuring device  called an interferometer the way this works is the following  you start with a laser beam  then you split it into 2 equal beams  typically using a halfsilvered mirror that reflects 12 of the beam and lets the other 12 through  and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles when they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror when the beams return to you  you recombine them into a single beam and they  interfere   depending on how far each beam travelled  this interference can be either  destructive  or  constructive   meaning the beams can either cancel each other out  or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter  at ligo  they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive  meaning that no light arrives at their detector but  when a gravitational wave comes in  it distorts spacetime  changing the lengths of the beams  and they no longer perfectly cancel out  thus  a light signal appears at the detector  i strongly suggest you watch the following video  which has a good visual representation of the process  around 1  30   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rzzgfkoifqi amp  nbsp    why is this so damn exciting     so many reasons  the incredible technical achievement  measuring changes down to 1 part in 1000000000000000000000 the longawaited confirmation of gravitational waves  which is a huge deal in itself perhaps most of all  the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy  one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our universe  finally  this result gives us some confidence that we  ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the big bang  and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe  tl  dr  there are no real tl  drs in science  and why would you want one  it  s worth it to try and understand cool things

sokind of a dumb question here  i ve read posts drawing analogies between ligo s laser setup and the detection of tiny changes in the length of a rod  so i m just going to frame my question in those terms by causing ripples through space time  are nt these gravitational waves not only changing the length of the metaphorical rod  but also  everything around it  including the very frame of reference of our reality  in that case  how did ligo manage to detect the alteration in spacetime  for example  looking at relativity and how gravitational fields affect time  there s a small difference in the passage of time between  say  a person on earth and a person in a satellite  but each of them perceives and measures that the same amount of time has passed  because their respective frames of reference are also affected  right  why is nt something like that happening here  i feel like i m doing a very poor job articulating my question here  but i hope one of you learned folks understand what i m trying to say and answer my query ,czw9ype,askscience,learning,1455215061.0,DocGrouch,22.0,0.0,81,754,0.0

it s easy enough to think of gravity as a 3d object such as a sphere pushing into a 2d plane creating a distortion and gravity waves as being the ripple effect as the magnitude of the gravitational forces fluctuate slightly can you help me understand how this would look like in 3d space time rather than just a 2d plane ,czw1udo,askscience,learning,1455203397.0,_fmm,9.0,0.0,2283,10037,0.0
