i graduated from pa and can provide some insight into coach kelly s strategy he never kicks field goals  always goes for 2 his thinking is most defenses do nt practice blocking against a team that goes for 2 every time also  he does nt want to put all his trust into one player  kicker  for that one extra point when he can put the ball in the qbs hands and have multiple options for 2 points  qb sneak  running back  wrs  etc  he also onside kicks every time  again because most teams do nt practice recovering onside kicks and his teams practices like crazy lastly  he does not field punts he lets them kick it as deep as they want and he just takes the ball from wherever they down it his thinking there is that a lot can go wrong when fielding a punt and give the other team the chance to recover a dropped ball or something similar he s has gotten a ton of grief here in the state for his antics  but it has paid off and he is highly regarded by pa students and alumni just thought i d throw out some info  edit  i meant punt  not kickoff calm yourselves ,d02aibu,todayilearned,learning,1455653609.0,SwapperJacks,88.0,0.0,8,435,0.0

this is the conventional theory but is not entirely true jupiter is still believed to be a protector in terms of long period  comets   but not asteroids in general the idea in your title largely stems from theorizations and computer simulations done in 1994 and earlier it was a ground breaking study but was done on inferior computing power with large approximations  for near orbit asteroids such as ones in the asteroid belt  more recent studies show that jupiter s gravity causes asteroid collisions  disrupting their orbit and sending more asteroids insystem towards earth  so  while it probably was helpful after the heavy bombardment period and the formation of our planet  the gas giants are believed to have caused the late heavy bombardment   and helps stave off longperiod comets  it is fond of throwing bits from the asteroid belt at us  wikipedia does nt even give a citation for the last part of the title   here is a source   http  wwwspacecom14919jupitercometimpactsearthhtml ,d02njpk,todayilearned,learning,1455672411.0,Donald_Keyman,134.0,0.0,292180,1800966,1.0

tr jr was a total bad ass  even if just for his actions on utah beach he had to plead his superior  the 4th inf div commander  to be allowed to land in the first wave  arguing that having someone with experience and skill like himself would be critical for a successful beachhead his commander reluctantly agreed to let him go  almost certain that roosevelt would be killed  quoting wikipedia  and i love reading this section   gt  roosevelt was one of the first soldiers  along with captain leonard t schroeder jr  off his landing craft as he led the us 4th infantry division s 8th infantry regiment and 70th tank battalion landing at utah beach roosevelt was soon informed that the landing craft had drifted more than a mile south of their objective  and the first wave of men was a mile off course walking with the aid of a cane and carrying a pistol  he personally made a reconnaissance of the area immediately to the rear of the beach to locate the causeways that were to be used for the advance inland he returned to the point of landing and contacted the commanders of the two battalions  lieutenant colonels conrad c simmons and carlton o macneely  and coordinated the attack on the enemy positions confronting them roosevelt s famous words in these circumstances were     we  ll start the war from right here     gt  these impromptu plans worked with complete success and little confusion with artillery landing close by  each followon regiment was personally welcomed on the beach by a cool  calm  and collected roosevelt  who inspired all with humor and confidence  reciting poetry and telling anecdotes of his father to steady the nerves of his men roosevelt pointed almost every regiment to its changed objective sometimes he worked under fire as a selfappointed traffic cop  untangling traffic jams of trucks and tanks all struggling to get inland and off the beach   one gi later reported that seeing the general walking around  apparently unaffected by the enemy fire  even when clods of earth fell down on him  gave him the courage to get on with the job  saying if the general is like that it ca nt be that bad   gt  when general barton  the commander of the 4th infantry division  came ashore  he met roosevelt not far from the beach he later wrote  gt  gt  while i was mentally framing  orders   ted roosevelt came up he had landed with the first wave  had put my troops across the beach  and had a perfect picture  just as roosevelt had earlier promised if allowed to go ashore with the first wave  of the entire situation i loved ted when i finally agreed to his landing with the first wave  i felt sure he would be killed   when i had bade him goodbye  i never expected to see him alive   you can imagine then the emotion with which i greeted him when he came out to meet me  near la grande dune   he was bursting with information  gt  by modifying his division s original plan on the beach  roosevelt enabled its troops to achieve their mission objectives by coming ashore and attacking north behind the beach toward its original objective   years later  general omar bradley was asked to name the single most heroic action he had ever seen in combat  and he replied   ted roosevelt on utah beach    and he was awarded the medal of honor these actions ,d02n83m,todayilearned,learning,1455671930.0,PbZnAg,6.0,0.0,103,814,0.0

i live up the street from where this happened it actually happened just outside of arlington  but in a small enough township that they contract with the city for police services  hence arlington pd action  the issue was nt weed the issue was that they were violating city ordinance by keeping old junk on the property and growing food without farming licenses several adjacent property owners had complained that it devalued their property  that the junk  which they recycled into useful things in the spirit of self sustainability  were harboring pests like rats and mosquito s  which im sure it was  the city had been sending notices and fining the property owners of the organic commune for quite some time for violations  but they really were looking for an angle to shut the whole thing down so  someone  reported a grow op there  believable if you know anyone that lived there  which i do  and a judge issued a raid warrant for it  of course  a warrant for weed does nt give them the right to use okra and tomatoes as evidence in a case  but it does give them the right to seize anything in the process of a search it was extremely dirty and not handled correctly by the city and arlington pd they lost a lot of support by the people around here because of it  i personally understand the gripes of the adjacent property owners  and i do nt think the owners of the commune property were very considerate of their neighbors  essentially ignoring them with  its my land  freedom  evil corporations lobby to make it illegal for me to grow my own food  and all of that  when it was nt about anything like that but the way the city handled things had a lot to be desired to say the very least ,d01c2oy,todayilearned,learning,1455584627.0,monzzter221,13.0,0.0,39,19378,0.0
when you are looking to start your own property and do things your own way  you have to appreciate the invasive nature of law enforcement and the stretching idea of plain view it s why so many property owners essentially build moats around their properties where they dig down about four or five feet and make it about six feet wide and will sometimes add a fence to the outside of it if your neighbors who have a house a quarter of a mile from your property line can see onto your property and find the state you keep it in distasteful  they can get code enforcement involved if they are annoying enough  if they ca nt see your property  the rare neighbor will trespass and then cry to the cops when your dogs chase them off or they cut themselves on the barbed wire you have on the top of the fence  when i went in on a property as part of a trust the first thing we made sure of  was that there were no neighbors it wo nt stop the cops from executing a warrant  but it makes it far harder to get a warrant and just because you are nt breaking the law does nt mean cops wo nt bust in and look for things to arrest you for or that there is no chance they wo nt plant drugs  government really does nt like people deviating from the accepted norm of being plebes ,d01bqkn,todayilearned,learning,1455584082.0,Davidkpa,7.0,0.0,1,11647,0.0

 from the article    in 1998 a team from the us forest service set out to investigate the cause of large tree dieoffs in the malheur national forest in east oregon  they identified affected areas in aerial photographs and collected root samples from 112 dead and dying trees  mostly firs tests showed all but four of the trees had been infected with the honey fungus armillaria solidipes  previously known as armillaria ostoyae   when mycelia from genetically identical a solidipes meet  they can fuse to form one individual the researchers harnessed this ability  growing fungi samples in pairs in petri dishes by observing which ones fused and which ones rejected each other  they found that 61 of the trees had been struck down by the same clonal colony  individuals with identical genetic makeup that all originated from one organism  the most widelyspaced were 24 miles  38 km  apart the team calculated that the a solidipes covered an area of 37 sq miles  96 sq km   and was somewhere between 1900 and 8650 years old  at the time  the largest known organism was a fungus of the same species discovered in 1992 in southwest washington  which stretches over 25 sq miles  65 sq km   biologists have long debated what constitutes an individual organism the recordbreaking a solidipes clonal colony passes the test based on a definition of being made up of genetically identical cells that can communicate  and that have a common purpose or can at least coordinate themselves ,d01q4ln,todayilearned,learning,1455613284.0,Larakine,3.0,0.0,1974,3031,0.0

when i was in college and my little brother was like 1617  he was mixed up with the wrong crowd at school  and started smoking weed and skipping school  apparently one of our neighbors saw him one day  when he was supposed to be in school  come out of the house and exchange money or something with one of his bad friends who drove by we live in a mostly white  uppermiddle class neighborhood  fast forward a few weeks later and i am at work and i get a call that there s a swat truck at my house and our whole street is crawling with police  a judge had apparently signed search warrant based on the reports of some nosycrappy neighbor  who instead of letting us know what my brother was up to  decided to just report my brother to the police  it felt like the cops somehow got the impression that they would find pablo escobar s cousin s operation in our house or something  we re originally from colombia  but have been living in the usa for almost 20 years   cuz the amount of excessive force they brought was ridiculous  they basically blew away our front door  and kicked in every door that was closed  even the unlocked interior doors  if it was closed  they knocked it down   they emptied out  everything  in every single room  closet  etc it was a mess i was surprised they did nt tear down the drywall  what did they find  a jar with  weed residue   according to them  in my brothers room and some old pain pills from when my other brother broke his ankle in 3 places playing soccer the previous year  the house was mostly empty   thank goodness  except for an aunt who was living in our basement at the time i got the call at work and got home asap when i got home  the cops started interrogating me  and then when my little brother got home the cops started recording my brother on video and trying to get him  to confess  about what they had found thankfully he did nt say anything stupid and i kept telling him to wait for my mother to get home before saying anything  after my mother got home  they simple showed her the warrant  and packed up and left neither my brother nor anyone at my house was ever arrested or indicted for anything from this search warrant and from that day onwards we lost all trust whatsoever in the local police ,d01ghc0,todayilearned,learning,1455591531.0,knownunknownsx,6.0,0.0,1,29,0.0

gt  weismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 white mice  repeatedly over 5 generations  and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail he stated that  901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents  and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ   10  weismann was aware of the limitations of this experiment  and made it clear that he embarked on the experiment precisely because  at the time  there were many claims of animals inheriting mutilations  he refers to a claim regarding a cat that had lost its tail having numerous tailless offspring   there were also claims of jews born without foreskins none of these claims  he said  were backed up by reliable evidence that the parent had in fact been mutilated  leaving the perfectly plausible possibility that the modified offspring were the result of a mutated gene the purpose of his experiment was to lay the claims of inherited mutilation to rest the results were consistent with weismann s germ plasm theory ,d01rle8,todayilearned,learning,1455619285.0,Jux_,7.0,0.0,225124,1453754,1.0

in an effort to make it easier for the til community to verify submissions  we re kindly asking that contributors make a top level comment after submitting a til   quoting the relevant text from their source    which should be concisely paraphrased in the submission title   this is not currently a requirement  but we d appreciate it if everyone would try their best to do it if the til you are posting is linking to a wikipedia page  please directly link to the section of the wikipedia page that is relevant to your til submission  in most cases this will be 2  3 sentences  but up to 4  5 should be fine if more context is required if it s not possible to copypaste the text  then a screenshot of the relevant part  preferably highlighted  or indicating where in the link provided is the relevant piece of information located is also acceptable if the source includes audio or video  then please link to the pertinent time stamp and transcribe it  note that if a source is  just  a table  graph or other raw datastatistics then you wo nt be able to quote it  by design   find another source  and see below for an explanation    we d also like to clarify our first rule about submissions needing to be verifiable with a reliable source that   completely   supports the claims in the post title this means that you   can not interpret data and draw your own conclusions    everything must be clearly and  explicitly  stated in your source  in words  we encounter a lot of issues when people try to submit technical papers  statistical data or other studies that  may  support a claim  but one that the authors do nt explicitly make  and hence subject to extra scrutiny   you have to make it clear when a source just provides evidence supportingrefuting a hypothesis  but does nt go as far as explicitly stating it as an accepted fact  this means that   merely quoting statistics and implicitly generalizing the results of a study is often not acceptable    you also need to be diligent about not misleading people with overly simplified  outdated or refuted claims   as an example  you may come across a paper describing a study where coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced incidents of cancer a misleading and unacceptable conclusion would be  1  gt  til coffee can cure 58  of cancer patients on the other hand  this would possibly be acceptable as the details make it clear that the result is not definitive  gt  til a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens you still have to do your research  because if this was later disproven or brought into question then it may subsequently removed as misleading by omission a variation that may better address this is  gt  til a 2004 study found that coffee consumption was negatively correlated with incidents of bowel cancer in senior citizens   however subsequent research was unable to replicate the results  of course at this point your til is less of an attention grabber and not particularly noteworthy  but hopefully this highlights some of the issues we face with verifying sensational claims   1 unless the authors made the same unconditional claim  which is highly unlikely    while we do our best to verify submissions and remain objective  please note that   extraordinary or controversial claims will likely be subject to more scrutiny   and it is up to contributors to make them as airtight as possible  and us to be pedantic     tl  dr    be extremely careful with primary sources  and do nt interpret datastatistics yourself  find a   reliable   source that does that for you and paraphrase   as always  we encourage everyone to report rule violations and send us a message about inaccurate tils if you feel something was unfairly removed then please first check the comments and then feel free to ask us  we try our best to tag all removals  but this system is somewhat limited  ,2kx75y,todayilearned,learning,1414789182.0,TILMods,2109.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

this is the conventional theory but is not entirely true jupiter is still believed to be a protector in terms of long period  comets   but not asteroids in general the idea in your title largely stems from theorizations and computer simulations done in 1994 and earlier it was a ground breaking study but was done on inferior computing power with large approximations  for near orbit asteroids such as ones in the asteroid belt  more recent studies show that jupiter s gravity causes asteroid collisions  disrupting their orbit and sending more asteroids insystem towards earth  so  while it probably was helpful after the heavy bombardment period and the formation of our planet  the gas giants are believed to have caused the late heavy bombardment   and helps stave off longperiod comets  it is fond of throwing bits from the asteroid belt at us  wikipedia does nt even give a citation for the last part of the title   here is a source   http  wwwspacecom14919jupitercometimpactsearthhtml ,d02njpk,todayilearned,learning,1455672411.0,Donald_Keyman,134.0,0.0,292180,1800966,1.0
