i m not sure rfrugal is where you want to seek information for this particular transaction you re asking if this a good deal for a car that fulfills more than just your needs in a vehicle if you need four wheels and a roof  no the car is not a frugal purchase or great  deal  if you have 17k to spend and want a small suv  no it still is not a great deal however  if you want a toyota highlander that is not exceptionally old  has a reasonable amount of miles for the model year  and is available for sale it is worth considering understand that having been a fleet vehicle means that at one time it was a car owned by a company and driven by multiple drivers that may have abused the car  hence the slightly higher than average miles per year  it also means that there was most likely scheduled maintenance checks and repairs done in order to keep the vehicle on the road to transport said potential abusers this company also probably had a milage cap on when they would sell off the vehicle before repairs were costlywhen value would nose dive personally if you are not mechanically inclined i would stay away from any former fleer vehicles  they are great deals on auction but there is a lot of inherent risk and potential cost in these vehicles ,czyhjwe,frugal,lifestyle,1455375867.0,Whiskey_Jak,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0

i m getting ready to propose to my girlfriend in the next couple months so i ve started looking at diamond rings i know some of you are going to say buying an overpriced rock is not frugal but i want to get her a diamond and i know she wants one too plus these clarity enhanced diamonds are my way of being frugal  anyways  i started looking at them when i saw how expensive they were in stores any decent looking ring that i liked was 1015k and the ones in my price range of 57k looked tiny so i started digging online and on ebay there are a lot of sellers that have clarity enhanced rings that means the clarity was enhanced by one grade by either laser drilling blemishes or fracture filling i have read the pros and cons and to me  it looks like all the cons were written by big jewelry companies  wo nt hold value  and phrases like that i think diamonds are a stupid  investment  and i m not buying it in hopes of reselling it or whatever later this is an engagement ring for her the only other con i read is that the fillings do not handle heat as well as diamonds so i need to let the jeweler know before they do any work on it  there s a seller about 4 hours from me that has really nice rings that i like for 6k  2ct vs1 color h solitaire   similar ones in stores are well over 10k i still plan on going to look in person first but i will be buying with an american express card for my protection he has a 30 day no fee return policy and i plan on getting it checked out an appraised locally to make sure it s not a fake or lab grown diamond  so does anyone here have or ever seen a clarity enhanced diamond ring  what were your thoughts on it  i m still going to go look at them since wasting one day to save thousands of dollars is a good bet but just wanted to hear other s opinions    edit  i learned about lab grown diamonds from you guys and did some research on them you re right  they are the same in every way and wig less flaws i can get an even bigger rock and still cut my price in half brought it up with her and she agreed rd that it s stupid to get a  real  minned diamond and would rather i save money looks like she s a keeper and i i just saved a few grand thanks to you guys   ,45sq8a,frugal,lifestyle,1455481268.0,its_Danik,12.0,0.0,205,1225,0.0

avoid corridors like the plague a corridor is like a small room that you only spend 15 seconds a day in  ca nt store anything in  yet have to heatcool anyway  personally  i think bedrooms are where people waste the most space unless it doubles as a living room or small office  desk and computer   a bedroom is not a place where you live  it s a place where you  sleep   you need a bed  some sort of place to hold your clothes  and that s it a huge  master bedroom  is nonsense  honestly  it s all about customizing the house to your personal needs if you do nt need it  do nt build it ,d02bocr,frugal,lifestyle,1455655129.0,Tripoteur,5.0,0.0,1,5101,0.0

i love my home and feel that i could not have used the space better even though it is cheaper to build up than out we went with a ranch style house so we can live here well into old age when the stairs might pose a problem our home is 1300 sq foot so it is not huge by any means 3 bedroom 2 bath  we have an open kitchen and living room with a big center island and cathedral ceilings making the space feel even bigger than it already is the island is a must  now that we have kids there is no better space for having the kids help with cooking when friends come over it really is nice to be able to prepare food and interact without being locked in a separate kitchen on holidaysbirthdaysevents it is nice having the extra open space to seat extended family  so to your question  i would plan on buying a house that will fit all the stages of your life and lifestyle we chose to build a house with mediumsmall bedrooms and bathrooms in favor of an expanded living room and kitchen to suit our love of cooking and entertaining ,d01wtab,frugal,lifestyle,1455633976.0,sosofast,15.0,0.0,3,150,0.0
embed storage into wasted spaces such as under staircases  furniture  etc  open concept designs waste less space on hallways and tend to feel larger than they are lots of windows  lights  and light colours also make spaces feel bigger than they are so you do nt feel cramped  for rooms that you wo nt be using often try to give them multiple uses for instance if you want a large dining room to accommodate extended family but really only have them over occasionally  consider a table that folds up rather than one that just has an insertable leaf also consider an expandable desk or one that folds out of a bookcase that can go in a corner when you do have family over those are just two examples but think of the concept in terms of how you use your home if you have a room that you will only use once a week  how can you combine spaces so you use it more often thus making the space more efficient ,d02btvn,frugal,lifestyle,1455655328.0,soccer_trekkie,5.0,0.0,5526,9242,1.0

as an architect  my two cents  every square foot does not cost the same amount  eg i ve had frugal clients stress over building a 15x12  kitchen vs a 13x12  kitchen  thinking  gee  at  200 a square foot that saves me  4800   in fact the real savings is much less both kitchens have the same amount of appliances  the same plumbing needs and almost the same amount of cabinets they both require the same type of floor and roof joists spanning them they both have the same amount of windows  the point is  do nt kill yourself skimping inches out of rooms the big moves are more important  minimizing wasted space  reducing energy and other life cycle costs  and getting the house you really need instead of keeping up with the joneses natural ventilation  durable materials and a house that your family can age in are all big keys toward an economical house in my book ,d02sn4x,frugal,lifestyle,1455680405.0,beanie0911,1.0,0.0,1,1347,0.0

hey buddy  i started working at your age too one thing you should do is watch your small checking account grow to like 500 or 1000 after your first grand then you will be so reluctant to just blow it away it feels really good to say that you have made 1000  and then it becomes easier to say  let s go for another 1000  then spend it on something after you get that next thousand it will be even harder to blow that away  so you will just slowly spend here and there  but never more than you make eventually  you will be at 5000 before you know it at that point  then you can decide whether you want to invest 80  of it in an index fund or a nice blue chip stock that you think will do better in the next 5 years since you are young you can afford to invest more of your money  more risk  because you probably wo nt need that   4000 immediately it could grow to  8000 in a few years or it could shrink to  2000  but its a risk you do nt want to miss at your age  tldr  reach your first 1000  then 20005000 choose to either invest it in stocks  or funds  i would do index   or into something like a car  enjoy maybe 10  of your paycheck on electronics  hobbies  or whatever you do to keep you happy ,czzaji1,frugal,lifestyle,1455428574.0,CalamariDude,6.0,0.0,59,18,0.0

hey people of rfrugal i m in a predicament i could use some advice on from some of you wise users  i own a 2006 ford escape 120k miles  owned for almost 4 years engine pretty much went out today clanking and squealing from engine have nt gotten a repair estimate  but i m guessing  15002000 for replacement  book value on the car is only  5k with a clean title mine is reconstructed putting it at  3k realistically with this  a even a  1500 repair does nt seem worth it when another issue is likely to pop up within a year or so  my income is  1800month after taxes rentbills not including vehicle insurance is roughly  1100 current insurance rate is  106 for liability on the ford  so full coverage on a newer vehicle will be higher of course  city living at 22 years old sucks lol  anyway  what say you reddit fix the beater  look into a newer vehicle  or any other ideas  tips if i do go the newer vehicle route  thanks  update  thank you all for the input  i ve decided i m going to shop around and get a diagnosis on the issue and a price to repair  last night i was pretty stressed and looking for a reason to buy a new car as it seemed it would make things easier than worrying about the current one  i know these escapes are supposed to run forever the issue was with myself getting lazy with maintenance in the last year or two when i first bought it  i lived with my parents and took care of it religiously  but after moving out it became less of a priority after work and bills a crappy lesson to learn  but it s certainly a wakeup call  as for my income  i m doing the best i can at the moment for a 22yr old but am working toward getting a better job more schooling  etc  i greatly appreciate everyone s help and advice ,45j8c4,frugal,lifestyle,1455347706.0,jsaranczak,41.0,0.0,12847,804,0.0

money comes first  you need it to put down on a damage deposit and first 1 or 2 months rent i ve found making a few trips to where i plan on moving to a couple months ahead helped me land jobs before the move go to atlanta  set up as many interviews as you can and be clear with exact dates that you ll be relocating if you find your job first then you will be able to look for an apartment closer to it so you wo nt need a car  depending on if you work very early transit might also not be running so consider a bicycle or scooter  as for the apartment it s about the same process as the job  show up a bit early do a lot of walk throughs and find a place that meets your needs if you re able to bring some furnishing from home that s always helpful otherwise second hand stores  kijiji or the similar local sites are great for cheap stuff  before you move you should have enough money saved for the cost of moving  your apartment  a few months of transit money  food  utilities  phone  small emergency fund if i made any jump when i was younger i saved enough to live without work for 3 months minimum cars are genuinely a lot of money to purchase  maintain and drive insurance  registration  possible accidents  break downs  minor replacements like windshield wipers even if you can not drive for a while i d always suggest it since it s a huge savings yearly  if you can avoid student debt  do it s the worst kind of debt and will kill your credit score if you do nt pay it back on time it s better to work  save and pay for school as you go when you go i would nt jump into school immediately after a move just because it s stressful enough up rooting your life and adding a busy schedule on top of that just think about putting down roots  getting financially stable  working and saving and reevaluating after a period of time living there  good luck and have fun   ,d0286oe,frugal,lifestyle,1455650501.0,Sasha_Fire,3.0,0.0,14238,14327,1.0

ideally  you d find a car that s  almost  new if someone buys a car and sells it to you the next day  it s functionally a brand new car but you d pay thousands of dollars less for it  of course  very few people can afford to buy a brand new car every couple years  so such occasions are rare  i think there s an argument to be made for buying a brand new car you know it has nt been abused and it s going to take a long  long time to develop any sort of flaw an old car can end up costing you more than a new one if you constantly have to pay for repairs on it  plus the hassle involved with it  does nt start when you need it  have to go to the garage 23 times a year  etc  is a major pain  a used car could conceivably be in great shape and serve you very well for many years but you wo nt know until you ve bought it and used it for a while it could be a dream  or it could be a nightmare it s a gamble  cars in general are a plague on mankind ,d008xbc,frugal,lifestyle,1455505166.0,Tripoteur,9.0,0.0,1,5101,0.0

scion is being discontinued by toyota  so you ll basically be buying the equivalent of a saturn  although probably more reliable   if you were going to buy new  i would get a honda fit or toyota yaris  because resale value will likely hold up better if you are financing  you will get a better interest rate on a new car vs a used one if you can not afford to finance the car for 36 months or less  than you can not afford the car do nt consider leasing because that s not frugal  for used  have you checked into a hyundai from the late 2000s to present  they are reliable  economical to run  and do nt carry the toyota tax make sure you get a reputable shop to check the vehicle before purchase during a  prepurchase inspection  or ppi avoid any luxury cars or european makes because they have high maintenance costs in the long term  most people with good used toyotas and hondas know what they have and will drive it  forever  there is a high demand for them on the used market and that s why they have such high resale value on the market buying a new honda fit or toyota yaris and keeping it for a very long time  15 years  is frugal in my opinion  provided that the rest of your finances are in good order ,d007fy3,frugal,lifestyle,1455502564.0,MemoryAccessRegister,1.0,0.0,1,1192,0.0

no  i think you are seeing a lot of posts saying do nt buy a truck and make better decision on what type of car to buy etc i d like to say i agree with those statements that being said the reason we can give good advice is that most of us learned from bad choices  it is your money i suggest you do your research and if you want frugal advice it is that the choice you ve laid out are not necessarily the most frugal choices  if you want car advice rwhatcarshouldibuy ideally from the frugal point of view you want to buy a 23 year old car with 2040k miles that has been maintained  oil changes etc  keep it until it is in the 89 year range andor 90100k miles  this is the time that the purchased vehicle deprecates the least ie you own it for the least loss in value per year then buy another used car  and sell your old one  you should be looking for bout 4 months before you purchase but be willing to jump on a great deal if you need to it is   always   worth it to take a multithousand dollar prospect to a trusted mechanic for a checkout before buying legit sellers will work with you on getting it there  possibly paying for it or knocking the cost from the price  i personally would not buy a car that you need to work on to get running period to many things can come up in discovery as you fix that  one item  that needs fixing ,d02rmf4,frugal,lifestyle,1455678718.0,ruat_caelum,1.0,0.0,33,7890,0.0

gt  i havent the first clue about credit cardsadvice on how to manage it etc credit cards have a billing cycle  a closing date  a grace period  and a due date  the billing cycle is simply the period in which you charge whatever charges appear on your online account activity  the closing date ends the billing cycle you will be mailed your statement  bill  with any charges  points  etc most activity is reported to the credit bureaus at this time but not necessarily  the grace period is the time frame between the closing date and due date this the when you can pay your entire bill without being charged interest i believe the federal mandated minimum is 21 days  the due date is the day your monthly payment is due you must at least pay the minimum to avoid late or delinquent payments pay a few days ahead  for payments take a few days to process  especially on sunday and federal holidays  you can still keep charging after the closing date as long as you do nt hit your credit limit your credit card does nt stop working any charges after the closing date will appear on the next monthly statement  start with small purchases like gas  groceries  maybe your cell phone bill  and internet bill do nt charge more than your monthly expenses or buy what you ca nt afford  always    always   pay your entire statement balance to avoid interest and on time there is no need to pay for interest if you re still wary  do nt purchase anything after your closing date until you pay off your statement  you can also  pay down  your credit card before the closing date  but i believe some credit issuers limit how many times you can do this  per day or per month do nt pay it down to zero because when your activity is reported to the credit bureaus  it will appear as if you re not using your credit card  gt  and was wondering if anyone had ideas on what are the best options  you mentioned gt  by around april i will be done with debt other than medical bills which i work on as i can  what does this mean  were these accounts in collections  or was this a payment plan with the medical facility ,d00xfwd,frugal,lifestyle,1455562588.0,RhetoricalTestQstNs,1.0,0.0,1,22595,0.0

keep a mental budget  or a paper one  the debtratio comment by uwallaby13 was spot on  do nt charge or spend more than 20  of your income per month  once your card is activated  call customer service and lower the max credit limit they will probably open it with an obscene limit like  20k or more limit it to  1k or  2k and lower the monthly spending cap to some amount lower than the credit cap do nt think of your bank as your friend  they will make it easy for you to mire yourself into indentured servitude to them  until you show up with a jd behind your name truth  you can also build credit by taking out a small loan for something you can pay for when i was 20 i took out a  3000 loan to pay for a trip to china mongolia amp  russia it was a fun trip  and i paid the loan off in 4 months instead of the 6 the loan was for my credit went up a lot  and if you take out a car loan  never miss a payment  seriously  the younger you begin to manage your credit  the younger you will be able to retire ,czzd4fo,frugal,lifestyle,1455435143.0,yetimind,1.0,0.0,1,7,0.0

i m not sure rfrugal is where you want to seek information for this particular transaction you re asking if this a good deal for a car that fulfills more than just your needs in a vehicle if you need four wheels and a roof  no the car is not a frugal purchase or great  deal  if you have 17k to spend and want a small suv  no it still is not a great deal however  if you want a toyota highlander that is not exceptionally old  has a reasonable amount of miles for the model year  and is available for sale it is worth considering understand that having been a fleet vehicle means that at one time it was a car owned by a company and driven by multiple drivers that may have abused the car  hence the slightly higher than average miles per year  it also means that there was most likely scheduled maintenance checks and repairs done in order to keep the vehicle on the road to transport said potential abusers this company also probably had a milage cap on when they would sell off the vehicle before repairs were costlywhen value would nose dive personally if you are not mechanically inclined i would stay away from any former fleer vehicles  they are great deals on auction but there is a lot of inherent risk and potential cost in these vehicles ,czyhjwe,frugal,lifestyle,1455375867.0,Whiskey_Jak,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0

gt  eating out is opposes the idea of eating frugal negative this is edging up on being cheap rather than frugal like  i do nt like to eat out at italian restaurants  because i m good at making a wide variety of pasta dishes and i know that 90  of the time i can make it better and cheaper at home i d rather spend my money on something i ca nt make easily  like thai food or sushi however  if a friend of mine says  hey  my birthday is this weekend and all i want is get the whole gang together at olive garden   i m obviously not going to be like  whoa  do you know how crazy their markup is  spend the next year getting your priorities in order and i ll catch you on your next birthday   i m going to go to the damn olive garden if you generally prefer not to eat out  fine if you have friends and loved ones that enjoy the social ritual of eating out and you insist on denying them that to save yourself a few bucks a month  probably less fine  moving on  groupon is great  but watch out for the fine print  eg  recently we used a groupon that said it was nt valid on  lunch specials   but it turned out that was code for  you can not use this groupon at all before a certain time of day    they do expire  but if your groupon expires unused you get your money back  so it s very low risk you can also reserve tables with opentable and get points towards a  20 gift certificate to the restaurant of your choice if you re not picky about where you eat  you can just search for 1000 point tables and end up essentially getting  10 back every time you eat out ,d02nmin,frugal,lifestyle,1455672526.0,UncleFatherJamie,2.0,0.0,1,1169,0.0

my current strategy is job  apartment  car  student loans job brings home the bacon to pay for the rest rent must be a priority that leaves the two loans i chose to prioritize my auto loan over my student loan because i have less time to pay the auto loan off  and it has a higher interest rate until that s cleared  i m paying minimum for student loans  for you  my advice is this  job and apartment need to have priority wait until you re settled to begin school  but do nt wait too long skip one semester  two at most  i finished undergrad in june 15  and have been meaning to enroll in some classes at the local junior college for a sign language interpreting certificate but life has gotten in the way     do a fafsa now if you re thinking of going this year  or do one in the beginning of 2017 if next car should be at the bottom if you re not paying on student loans yet bike and public transit will have to do if you re near a college  public transit is usually decent ,d0277x8,frugal,lifestyle,1455649186.0,plopo,2.0,0.0,2941,703,0.0

as an architect  my two cents  every square foot does not cost the same amount  eg i ve had frugal clients stress over building a 15x12  kitchen vs a 13x12  kitchen  thinking  gee  at  200 a square foot that saves me  4800   in fact the real savings is much less both kitchens have the same amount of appliances  the same plumbing needs and almost the same amount of cabinets they both require the same type of floor and roof joists spanning them they both have the same amount of windows  the point is  do nt kill yourself skimping inches out of rooms the big moves are more important  minimizing wasted space  reducing energy and other life cycle costs  and getting the house you really need instead of keeping up with the joneses natural ventilation  durable materials and a house that your family can age in are all big keys toward an economical house in my book ,d02sn4x,frugal,lifestyle,1455680405.0,beanie0911,1.0,0.0,1,1347,0.0

these parts are cheaper still on amazon and yes you can do air filters yourself quite easily  but anything that oil touches is nt worth diy in my opinionexperience  getting rid of used oil is at least  15 worth of hassle to me i saw a local mechanic advertising  2499 oil changes so i called and asked how much for just labor if i brought my own oil and filter  15  which is what i ve paid him for the labor on the last dozen oil changes in my car  getting the  very expensive  oil and filter on amazon at a reasonable price i drive 30000 miles a year so the savings add up i bring my own parts to this shop for all sorts of work and one of the reasons that i stick with him is because i have nt caught him trying to gouge me on anything  and even though his techs have made a few mistakes over the years he s always made it right in the end  i ve encountered people on reddit and facebook who mock me for choosing to have a mechanic do work that i could do myself but i find it to be a good value  and i ve encountered people on reddit  mostly rtdi which has gotten pretty toxic lately  who find the idea of paying separately for parts and labor to be weirdly offensive but it s a system that has served me well i drive a lot and i prefer to spend my car time behind the wheel rather than under under the hood or on my back ,d00roij,frugal,lifestyle,1455554171.0,NotRoryWilliams,11.0,0.0,347,27513,1.0

what is the climate where you live  for some of us insulation and climate control is necessary for survival  but if you live in a tropical area you may be able to save a lot of money there  also  dryer areas allow the use of different materials than wetter area straw bales covered in mud lath can be very effective in a cold dry climate  but in a wet area i would not consider it adobe construction is nice in a hot dry climate  are any building materials available for collection in your area  pioneers in north america built log cabins or sod houses because they could simply collect the materials for free  and the cost of transporting manufactured goods would be cost prohibitive  ,czzwt2b,frugal,lifestyle,1455483471.0,pembinariver,0.0,0.0,1,21631,0.0

my wife and i actually did this 5 years ago as an engagement trip we had an absolutely great time  advice i can give   use tripadvisorcom to find out what is recommended in each town you plan to visit we found so much interesting things that people recommended   we actually rented an apartment for a week in the netherlands and it was way cheaper than a hotel and really immersed us in the local scene i forget what site we used it there are a lot of them out there  just google it  we looked for a bicycle tour as soon as we got somewhere as the first thing we did it helped orient you to the city and you can get a lot of the  touristy  things out of the way quickly and it was pretty fun   do nt rush  at first we had a schedule that basically had us traveling or viewing something every day the best thing we did was slow down in each city we took at least one day to simply have no plans it was so amazing to spend a day walking the canals of amsterdam with no where to be and no plans it made the trip that much more meaningful and it made it far cheaper to just walk and stop in a random cafe for a beer or glass of wine than paying for travel or admission somewhere ,czz7u6a,frugal,lifestyle,1455422887.0,yeahyouknowme2,4.0,0.0,1441,1699,0.0

i think it is hard for any of us to help you with specifics without having some idea where you are  because i think building material costs really vary i hear you saying that you re using hollowblocks and metal roofing  do you already have all of them that you need  i m no building expert  but if by hollowblocks you mean what i know as cinder blocks  i thought you had to also have rebar and some other stuff to make that work do you have all the materials  or are you still trying to figure out all your materials  this picture here is the sort of image that came to my mind when you said  hollowblocks   http  wwwultimatehandymancomwpcontentuploads200901cinderblockwall1024x768jpg ,czzv778,frugal,lifestyle,1455480647.0,nyx1969,3.0,0.0,1,5285,0.0
i ve seen places that have used cement and glass bottles for an exterior wall fairly cheap to do  mainly the time to get the bottles  build a form for the cement  and then the labor to mix it all once the bottles are in place  there s also been the plastic soda bottles in the tin roof to provide more light inside but keep in mind you d have to add some bleach and water inside the bottle to prevent algae build up and it is likely they d have to be replaced due to ultraviolet from the sun but those are cheap building materials  most of the plans i see here in the us is for trailers because of the limitations on building codes since you do nt have that worry  that s nice but it means far less plans  had you a bit more money  i d say lay down foundations and then move a conex in conexs are the shipping containers used in shipping and are sold after shipment you d have to have a truck to move it in or pay to have it done and a method to lift it off the truck and put it in place you can later install windows and doors i ve seen some pretty nice layouts using this method with everything you would need from showers to dishwashers  kitchen  bedroom  shower  etc ,czzwiau,frugal,lifestyle,1455482959.0,sloppy,0.0,0.0,1025,15369,0.0
how did you choose these places  it looks like a fairly random selection of famous destinations with a few more random ones thrown in  bern looks pretty cool  but i m not sure if it s detourworthy   and to get between these places you d have to pass through cool destination  nice to aosta you d have to go via turin i guess   how much have you traveled  i ve personally found that i usually want to stay put for 34 days  get acquainted with a place  and the best memories are from the quirky cafes we went to everyday  not the main sights i ca nt do train  museum  museum  church  sleep  repeat  unless you have special reasons for those exact destinations  and unless you know from experience you like really fastpaced travel  i d suggest you cut down the number of stops and the distances between them this will make it much easier to be frugal too ,czzxzcu,frugal,lifestyle,1455485424.0,sharkinwolvesclothin,3.0,0.0,35,4949,0.0

you need to do some math to figure out your best course of action your total transportation expenses should never exceed 20  of your yearly earnings  and if you re wanting to be frugal about it  then it should be much lower let s use a yearly earning of 40k for this example  and we ll use the max 20   20  of 40k is  666month cost of car ownership items that are nt going to widely vary no matter what car you buy are gas  maintenancerepairs  and insurance lets say you drive 1k milesmonth  industry average   if the vehicle that you re going to buy gets 20mpg average then you ll use 50 gallonsmonth so  lets just round gas out to 100month because you re financing  you ll need comp and collision insurance so we ll estimate that at  150month maintenance costs  oil changes  tires  repairs  registration  inspection  etc  will be about 100month  but could be more if you buy an older vehicle we ll just stick with 100 because its close enough that means the max you have to finance the vehicle is  310month if your credit is decent you ll get about 5  interest rate financing that puts you at  19500 total to be financed your cost of ownership  insurance  gas  maintenance  over 5 years will be  21000 so over 5 years you ll spend right at 40k to drive this car you re going to buy lets say the car is 4 years old and has industry average miles when you buy it  48k miles over 5 years you ll have put another 60k on it now you have a car with 108k that you spent  40k on  you could put an extra  100month into repairs for your camry  drive that for 5 more years  and have spent  26k total  based on our ownership costs  and save the rest of the money we wo nt even consider the savings on the insurance by not having to have comp or collision  we ll use that as a buffer in case anything goes catastrophically wrong with the car or in our budgeting then use the 14k plus whatever else you saved to buy a  15k car for cash in 2021  if that s what you want to do  or you could use the money from selling your vehicle plus some of your current savings to buy a better vehicle than you have now for cash and continue banking the difference then just keep upgrading your vehicle every so often in the same manner  paying cash plus the value of your current vehicle  this is how you get ahead this is how you stay out of debt debtfree is the most frugal thing you can do do nt be a slave to your debt and your life will be richer and more fulfilling this is what being frugal is about ,d00lu2s,frugal,lifestyle,1455543094.0,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,1.0,0.0,3026,7538,0.0

my first tip would be do nt go to a dealer they generally charge quite a bit more than private party because they need to make money that aside  i was able to purchase a 2010 kia soul for 8900 that had 48500 miles on it it took about a month of searching craiglsist and dealer websites but it was by far the best deal for a 2010 with that kind of mileage  i average about 28 mpg which is nt the best but beats the hell out of the 14 mpg i was getting out of my old chevy truck it s a fun car and i like it  and similar size vehicles that age with similar mileage were considerably higher in cost good luck ,d00ydsx,frugal,lifestyle,1455563922.0,opisan,1.0,0.0,92,134,0.0
