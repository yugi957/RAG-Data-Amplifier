wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital ,d02stss,news,news,1455680717.0,wsides,1.0,0.0,1,2163,0.0

something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but ,d00uue2,news,news,1455558861.0,cl3ophatra,189.0,0.0,1539,1458,0.0

currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions ,d014awm,news,news,1455572474.0,anonymouspirates,9.0,0.0,92,52,0.0

wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital ,d02stss,news,news,1455680717.0,wsides,1.0,0.0,1,2163,0.0

horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 times,d01katg,news,news,1455597839.0,WifehasDID,2.0,0.0,1,26619,1.0
it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt ,d01jn6i,news,news,1455596658.0,Throwawaygoaway6969,2.0,0.0,1,3950,0.0

this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet ,d01ppsf,news,news,1455611730.0,guuutbutttt,155.0,0.0,1,2586,0.0
