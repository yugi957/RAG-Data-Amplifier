in the season 2 episode  abed s uncontrollable christmas   when searching for the meaning of christmas abed discovers it is actually a lost season 1 box set although it is just a metaphor for a lack of payoff in the show and in abed s mind  it also makes a good metaphor for community as a whole  in lost and community a group of damaged strangers end up stuck somewhere they do nt want to be but end up working together to overcome the obstacles and adventures they face throughout lost and community it is revealed that all of these characters are connected through their pasts and it was destiny that they ended up where they are  season 4  wherein harmon got booted from the show  saw the beginning of problems for the show  and it was widely hated by fans lost also faced this problem in it s 4th season facing the writer s strike  the season was cut down and also marked a low point for most fans it was also in this season of lost where some of the survivors finally made it off the island  much like jeff finally leaving greendale mirroring this  jack  the leader of the group in lost  and jeff both soon experience their lives falling apart when they try to get back to what they were before this leads both of them back to where they originally did nt want to be in both season 5 s along with reuniting the remaining members of the groups both shows saw problems in the real world that resulted in the loss of characters on the show and altered plot lines notably pierce and troy in community and mr eko or walt from lost  which brought in new characters on both shows to fill in the gaps  both shows end with season 6  for now   and fans of both will say that the quality of both fell over the last three seasons fans of both will also argue about the quality of the last seasons as well  including the finales in the end of both the remaining characters come together and move on together for the most part so in that box in season 2  abed found the answer to his quest  but he also found a clue to what the rest of his series would be like   a lack of payoff  while both shows do have their problems in their second halves  i do think they are both worth it and great television ,43y2cc,community,television,1454471559,dalarro,8,0,796.0,1067.0,0.0

on a kick ass show like community  seriously  it s refreshing to see a cool  smart  nerdy character with a great sense of humor  who also drives many of community s selfcontained adventures   it would have been awesome for him to be played by an actual palestinian actor  they do exist  but i ll take what i can get after watching the show  there is no doubt in my mind that daniel pudi is abed i do nt think anyone else could bring as much life to the character as daniel pudi and i m really happy that he s the guy it s quite refreshing when most tv shows and movies these days are showing arab characters  including palestinians  as terrorists and other assorted bad guys i hope this really opens doors for hollywood to bring us more arab characters in leading roles that break the stereotypes of what was traditionally seen as  reel bad arabs  ,457qzk,community,television,1455177451,BibiAFterDark,31,0,96.0,500.0,0.0

i think that sitcoms are usually more about creating an emotional connection with the characters  and seeing people in normal life situations  while dramas are usually about exciting situations and people who lead unusual lives dramas are usually more about tension  so their finales are more about relieving the tension and giving you the answers there are some dramas with very emotional endings  six feet under   but with sitcoms you really relate and connect with the characters  plus there s usually more emotional subplots like romances ,czx91io,community,television,1455283389,awesomeness0232,7,0,1555.0,35073.0,0.0

everybody always says season 2 was the show s peak and that three was too cartoonish  but i think it might be my favorite  potentially because of that  but yeah  get ready for some real peaks and troughs headed your way season 4 is almost universally panned while seasons 5 and 6 take some drastic departures from the earlier seasons  particularly season 6 whether or not it works is really up to personal tastes  though for what it s worth i m glad i stuck through to the end  well  the end until the movie  of course ,d00i96o,community,television,1455529549,fly19,58,0,624.0,34371.0,0.0

season 3 is my favorite by far it just had more episodes that made me sit back and say   this show is genius  i do nt know why but the video game episode is my favorite of all the  voiceover  episodes  i think the problem after season 4 is trying to force them back into the study group when there is no real reason for them to be there as much as i wanted the show to continue  i did nt think the save greendale committee felt organic  i mean  jeff should have needed a jd  right  to me it seems almost more believable that the dean would have figured out a way to have a jd program just for jeff so he could stay on as a student annie would have been interested in getting a second degree britta ca nt do anything with a bachelors in psych  she needs more schooling abed would just go along with the group  heck  he d show up all year and then reveal that he s not a student any longer shirley had her business to run but could have still come around on break it just could have been easier to keep them as actual students instead of whatever they became ,d00itp5,community,television,1455531984,horsenbuggy,27,0,146.0,46255.0,0.0

i just finished watching community for the first time i spent about a week and a half watching the entire series i loved it  however  there are some thoughts that i had while watching it  i liked chang in the beginning  when he was a crazy but sane man since season 3  he became crazy stupid and i hated it  the dean is hilarious  i did nt know jim rash was in this  i really liked the way  way back  but i believe he was a little too much in the show in the last couple seasons  i really liked the character development in this show in the beginning  i thought abed would be a little annoying  and he became my 2nd favorite character  first one being troy  troy and abed s relationship the show was great and  to me  this was one of the best and most entertaining aspects of it i love how abed and  especially  troy changed because of their friendship  i became sad when pierce died and troy left  but almost cried when abed was remembering troy in the finale and started crying  i loved the double hug jeff gave to abed just before he moved to la in the finale  i do nt believe season 4 is as bad as people give credit for  it obviously is not as good as the other seasons  especially 13  but is still one of the best sitcoms of all time imho  i also love the running gags and continuity of this show  ps if you like this show  please  please watch the it crowd  one of the funniest shows ever made,44oujj,community,television,1454897800,robeacero1,5,0,98.0,329.0,0.0
when it comes to the dean and his gradual getting too much  towards the end  you need to consider that binging it and watching it over the course of many years is going give you a different perspective at least in my opinion  the same goes with chang  the ramp up is a lot more noticeable if you watch back to back and can teasily hink back to how characters were in the beginning  because you watched those episodes the weekday before  to how they ended up  which is batshit crazy  creepy  pervy and scary   the more i rewatch  the more chang and the dean seem to be not too crazy at all  agreed re it crowd  so good ,czsswdc,community,television,1454974205,Knock-Off-Nigel,2,0,211.0,1513.0,1.0

i ca nt believe how great this episode was  i always thought the episode was cool because i found the idea of different timelines intriguing but now i see the episode from a different perspective  it s amazing how the writers used one timeline to explain something in another for example  the first timeline shown shows the gun in annie s purse and explains how pierce gets shot later  also  in every timeline jeff hits his head in the true  timeline  when he hits his head someone  i think annie  calls it karma for devising a system where he never has to get the pizzas karma gets him in each timeline  and since jeff leaves  britta sings roxanne and leads to the happiest ending of the 7  just wanted to share my reaction to an episode i have nt watched in a few years ,43f4q7,community,television,1454177066,MayorJack,297,0,8518.0,8049.0,0.0

i rewatched season 4 last night i knew this would be the last episodes with pierce as a main cast member and it made me reflect on his presence in the show  sure  pierce was a tad racist  sexist  and a little crazy in his old age but he had his moments  pierce helped guide the group often back in intro to pottery he taught jeff that failure is okay and you learn from it he helped shirley with her business presentation and later opening her own sandwich shop  her goal of going to greendale and in season 4 he helped boost britta s confidence and got jeff to be nicer to her with the sophie b hawkins dance even after his death  he teaches troy to become his own man  pierce was a very important part of the group i wish chevy stayed in the show it gave troy a good writeoff but still the show lost something important when pierce left ,44afhh,community,television,1454671433,MayorJack,185,0,8518.0,8049.0,0.0

annie  was probably not the ass crack bandit   a certain man once lost a diamond cufflink in the wide blue sea  and twenty years later  on the exact day  a friday apparently  he was eating a large fish  but there was no diamond inside that  s what i like about coincidence  1 the acb  if he ever existed  stopped being active over a year ago  but as of s5e3 is active again  2 no motive was ever established for the acb but one individual did have a clear motive prior to the episode for reemerging as the acb the acb was also revealed to be much more dedicated and masterful than just someone committing a crime that nets victims 25 cents a pop but was nt that just a part of the joke  like when everyone went all homicide detective and ada because a yam was murdered  yes  but it was also something more  3 the acb was not a dave fan  the acb was someone who knew jeff was a dave fan and duncan was a dave fan  strangely  no one else knew duncan was  even jeff  duncan s  closest friend   who presumably after 5 years of acquaintance would have stumbled upon their shared fanhood  the acb left annie a juicy teachersloungeshortcut clue which caused her to nudge jeff to take up the case and jeff then discovered the song titles clue in a note these two things led annie to  teacher who is a dave fan   causing her to eventually peg duncan  revealed a bit later as a red herring without jeff she would nt have got there coincidence  no  all part of the acb s plot  4 the acb had full access to the entire school and could move around with command and considerable premeditation  somehow lying in wait for troy and even setting a trap  somehow ambushing duncan at just the right moment very convenient or a lot of coincidence the acb also had knowledge of and access to campus systems and any piece of tech that was necessary  nvgs  terminal for hacking into the phone system the acb somehow knew jeff and annie would be in the dean s office when the recorded message was played and the message effectively served to keep them on the case all just part of the acb s plot  5 via the recording  the acb arranged for the crimes to be pinned on alex  who the acb knew was alive and where located the dean  and everyone else  did nt even know the stables or alex  still  existed the acb somehow knew  6 coincidence  or the acb arranged for a dave song to be played at the dance at just the right moment  causing jeff to discover alex was nt the acb  which somehow  almost magically  led jeff to discover the hacked phone system that should have opened up more questions in jeff s mind  especially about a recording that was so prescient and tailored  not to mention the crazy effort the acb was putting into this  and spurred jeff to answer them it did nt just as the acb plotted it  jeff was then distracted by annie s false duncan hit  7 the acb should ve passed shirley as she was coming from the dead end the only other possibility is that the acb somehow caused jeff and annie to think they were pursuing him when they were nt he did that the whole episode really because if they had solved the case  it would have pushed them  and maybe everyone  over the edge  8 toward the end of the episode possible motives are shown for or suspicions cast upon a number of people this was part of the acb s plan to sow doubt but sow doubt in who  another big clue  it seems abed is included in the montage it sets abed up as a prime suspect abed is one of the few people whose whereabouts are unknown at the time of every cracking shown why is he not at troy s side during the dean s triumphant troy s lawbathroomcameras event  abed is glued to troy as doting caregiver everywhere else is abed the acb  was he deleting the shows because he d completed his homage  from the antagonist s side this time  and was over it  was he throwing everyone off his scent by only pretending he hated the whole premise of the episode s homage  you have to ask yourself how much power abed actually has in the world could he have known everything the acb knew and achieved everything the acb achieved  for instance  duncan s cracking was clearly premeditated to throw everything over when annie and jeff thought it was wrapped up  to toy with them  to confuse them and to mock the genre convention of cheap  leftfield twists the implication is that the acb had some hand in a shoe being untied by british standards that is  as several of the others mentioned above are  a little beyond even abed s powers perhaps this all annoyed abed because his role as homage puppet master was usurped was abed frustrated that there was nt going to be a homage at all but rather a biting parody  is that why he mocks the genre he had been absorbed in  has he been bitch slapped by some realization  causing him to feel betrayed  at any rate  abed is certainly just another red herring  9 if abed used his social disorder as a procedural device  he alone knew the acb s identity and that knowledge in part caused him to declare the whole thing a farce and bow out of the investigation this should have set off sirens to anyone watching  because abed had immersed himself in the genre and his usual response would have been to recognize the potential of the acb s return and turn the whole episode into a the bridgehannibalzodiacetc bit but he declared the genre a joke and left because he could see behind the curtain   abed knows everything   he knew what a set up the whole thing was and also knew  in a sense  that it was effectively impossible to solve and he d been put in his place no more fanboy homages now it s snarky parody  10 the entire investigation is derailed by the news of pierce s death it s possible the acb killed pierce just to this end  11 in short  the acb had whatever access and knowledge he needed  played everyone like puppets  caused people to act irrationally when it suited  caused people to think things that were nt necessarily true  caused you to accept as coincidence things that were extremely unlikely  under the guise of mocking the cliches of the genre  and caused you to be misled with an unnecessarily complicated  answer  that multiplied causes and does nt pass the ockham s razor test if you believe the acbismultiplepeople theory  i m sorry  you ve been duped because  only one person had the power and motive to do what the acb did  including messing with the audience  dan harmon  so what was his motive  should be obvious he wanted to do an acb episode and he wanted it to be parody  not homage so abed had to be taken out of play because either his fanboying would mess up the parody or he d be part of the parody and hence out of character harmon wanted to kill pierce too and killing pierce as a cheap  cliched investigationending  thoughtkilling twist was just the icing on the cake and abed was suddenly forced to abandon homage  and to be genuinely contemptuous of the mildly autistic super detective genre because he  was  the mildly autistic super detective in the show that only he knew existed and it was completely useless  not like on tv   abed knew the truth but would only be called  more  autistic if he explained it to everyone the only guy who solved the mystery bailed on the episode  just as the acb knew he would just another pawn in the acb s plot ,44betb,community,television,1454687846,AndySipherBull,5,0,12248.0,51730.0,0.0

annie  was probably not the ass crack bandit   a certain man once lost a diamond cufflink in the wide blue sea  and twenty years later  on the exact day  a friday apparently  he was eating a large fish  but there was no diamond inside that  s what i like about coincidence  1 the acb  if he ever existed  stopped being active over a year ago  but as of s5e3 is active again  2 no motive was ever established for the acb but one individual did have a clear motive prior to the episode for reemerging as the acb the acb was also revealed to be much more dedicated and masterful than just someone committing a crime that nets victims 25 cents a pop but was nt that just a part of the joke  like when everyone went all homicide detective and ada because a yam was murdered  yes  but it was also something more  3 the acb was not a dave fan  the acb was someone who knew jeff was a dave fan and duncan was a dave fan  strangely  no one else knew duncan was  even jeff  duncan s  closest friend   who presumably after 5 years of acquaintance would have stumbled upon their shared fanhood  the acb left annie a juicy teachersloungeshortcut clue which caused her to nudge jeff to take up the case and jeff then discovered the song titles clue in a note these two things led annie to  teacher who is a dave fan   causing her to eventually peg duncan  revealed a bit later as a red herring without jeff she would nt have got there coincidence  no  all part of the acb s plot  4 the acb had full access to the entire school and could move around with command and considerable premeditation  somehow lying in wait for troy and even setting a trap  somehow ambushing duncan at just the right moment very convenient or a lot of coincidence the acb also had knowledge of and access to campus systems and any piece of tech that was necessary  nvgs  terminal for hacking into the phone system the acb somehow knew jeff and annie would be in the dean s office when the recorded message was played and the message effectively served to keep them on the case all just part of the acb s plot  5 via the recording  the acb arranged for the crimes to be pinned on alex  who the acb knew was alive and where located the dean  and everyone else  did nt even know the stables or alex  still  existed the acb somehow knew  6 coincidence  or the acb arranged for a dave song to be played at the dance at just the right moment  causing jeff to discover alex was nt the acb  which somehow  almost magically  led jeff to discover the hacked phone system that should have opened up more questions in jeff s mind  especially about a recording that was so prescient and tailored  not to mention the crazy effort the acb was putting into this  and spurred jeff to answer them it did nt just as the acb plotted it  jeff was then distracted by annie s false duncan hit  7 the acb should ve passed shirley as she was coming from the dead end the only other possibility is that the acb somehow caused jeff and annie to think they were pursuing him when they were nt he did that the whole episode really because if they had solved the case  it would have pushed them  and maybe everyone  over the edge  8 toward the end of the episode possible motives are shown for or suspicions cast upon a number of people this was part of the acb s plan to sow doubt but sow doubt in who  another big clue  it seems abed is included in the montage it sets abed up as a prime suspect abed is one of the few people whose whereabouts are unknown at the time of every cracking shown why is he not at troy s side during the dean s triumphant troy s lawbathroomcameras event  abed is glued to troy as doting caregiver everywhere else is abed the acb  was he deleting the shows because he d completed his homage  from the antagonist s side this time  and was over it  was he throwing everyone off his scent by only pretending he hated the whole premise of the episode s homage  you have to ask yourself how much power abed actually has in the world could he have known everything the acb knew and achieved everything the acb achieved  for instance  duncan s cracking was clearly premeditated to throw everything over when annie and jeff thought it was wrapped up  to toy with them  to confuse them and to mock the genre convention of cheap  leftfield twists the implication is that the acb had some hand in a shoe being untied by british standards that is  as several of the others mentioned above are  a little beyond even abed s powers perhaps this all annoyed abed because his role as homage puppet master was usurped was abed frustrated that there was nt going to be a homage at all but rather a biting parody  is that why he mocks the genre he had been absorbed in  has he been bitch slapped by some realization  causing him to feel betrayed  at any rate  abed is certainly just another red herring  9 if abed used his social disorder as a procedural device  he alone knew the acb s identity and that knowledge in part caused him to declare the whole thing a farce and bow out of the investigation this should have set off sirens to anyone watching  because abed had immersed himself in the genre and his usual response would have been to recognize the potential of the acb s return and turn the whole episode into a the bridgehannibalzodiacetc bit but he declared the genre a joke and left because he could see behind the curtain   abed knows everything   he knew what a set up the whole thing was and also knew  in a sense  that it was effectively impossible to solve and he d been put in his place no more fanboy homages now it s snarky parody  10 the entire investigation is derailed by the news of pierce s death it s possible the acb killed pierce just to this end  11 in short  the acb had whatever access and knowledge he needed  played everyone like puppets  caused people to act irrationally when it suited  caused people to think things that were nt necessarily true  caused you to accept as coincidence things that were extremely unlikely  under the guise of mocking the cliches of the genre  and caused you to be misled with an unnecessarily complicated  answer  that multiplied causes and does nt pass the ockham s razor test if you believe the acbismultiplepeople theory  i m sorry  you ve been duped because  only one person had the power and motive to do what the acb did  including messing with the audience  dan harmon  so what was his motive  should be obvious he wanted to do an acb episode and he wanted it to be parody  not homage so abed had to be taken out of play because either his fanboying would mess up the parody or he d be part of the parody and hence out of character harmon wanted to kill pierce too and killing pierce as a cheap  cliched investigationending  thoughtkilling twist was just the icing on the cake and abed was suddenly forced to abandon homage  and to be genuinely contemptuous of the mildly autistic super detective genre because he  was  the mildly autistic super detective in the show that only he knew existed and it was completely useless  not like on tv   abed knew the truth but would only be called  more  autistic if he explained it to everyone the only guy who solved the mystery bailed on the episode  just as the acb knew he would just another pawn in the acb s plot ,44betb,community,television,1454687846,AndySipherBull,5,0,12248.0,51730.0,0.0

this episode heralded the start of jeff moving on from his unrequited crush on britta it s interesting that when he was all over her at the start of season one and she s not interested but by season two she seems to have agreed to a kind of pseudo relationship  when he was no longer smitten with her we see this side of her again in origins of vampire mythology  when she only goes for blade when she thinks he does nt care  jeff also reaches a major milestone in this story  when he sacrifices his night with slater to help pierce this is  i think a big step for him jeff in the pilot would never have even conceived of doing such a thing  abed as batman is amazing especially his rescue of jeff and pierce  i feel a bit bad for annie in this one  that her horrible high school experience made her feel so inadequate that she thought she could nt make the night a success on her own her face at the end though when dancing with jeff when one ship docks another sails  i suppose ,czl895a,community,television,1454436757,SecretCupcakeEater,8,0,1.0,141.0,0.0
i rewatched season 4 last night i knew this would be the last episodes with pierce as a main cast member and it made me reflect on his presence in the show  sure  pierce was a tad racist  sexist  and a little crazy in his old age but he had his moments  pierce helped guide the group often back in intro to pottery he taught jeff that failure is okay and you learn from it he helped shirley with her business presentation and later opening her own sandwich shop  her goal of going to greendale and in season 4 he helped boost britta s confidence and got jeff to be nicer to her with the sophie b hawkins dance even after his death  he teaches troy to become his own man  pierce was a very important part of the group i wish chevy stayed in the show it gave troy a good writeoff but still the show lost something important when pierce left ,44afhh,community,television,1454671433,MayorJack,185,0,8518.0,8049.0,0.0

this episode heralded the start of jeff moving on from his unrequited crush on britta it s interesting that when he was all over her at the start of season one and she s not interested but by season two she seems to have agreed to a kind of pseudo relationship  when he was no longer smitten with her we see this side of her again in origins of vampire mythology  when she only goes for blade when she thinks he does nt care  jeff also reaches a major milestone in this story  when he sacrifices his night with slater to help pierce this is  i think a big step for him jeff in the pilot would never have even conceived of doing such a thing  abed as batman is amazing especially his rescue of jeff and pierce  i feel a bit bad for annie in this one  that her horrible high school experience made her feel so inadequate that she thought she could nt make the night a success on her own her face at the end though when dancing with jeff when one ship docks another sails  i suppose ,czl895a,community,television,1454436757,SecretCupcakeEater,8,0,1.0,141.0,0.0

this episode really reminded me what a great dynamic jeff and abed have i really like episodes where they get paired together  which i think happened a lot more in the first season than it did in subsequent seasons jeff hugging abed at the end was also nice  it showed that jeff really appreciated abed letting him stay with him when he was essentially homeless it also surprised me because we are still pretty early into the series at this stage  and jeff is already coming so far as a character even if he still needs a lot of material things in his life  he s starting to appreciate the things the other members of the study group do for him like let him stay in their dorm with them  or breaking into his apartment to steal some faucets  also our first time meeting pavel  abed s polish dorm neighbour   who i m pretty sure we never hear speak a word of polish ,czlp9rh,community,television,1454460919,prettysorchastic,5,0,16.0,173.0,0.0

i am currently watching about 25 different shows and nothing can fill the emptiness of community  well  the things that helped me the most were actually cartoons  because honestly  they feel the closest thing in quality so  strange recommendations  but steven universe and gravity falls  are really nice and do nt have that many episodes   adventure time  it s on its sixth season  so a lot of of episodes   also  archer  which is very nice but different from the other options  ,czkua6x,community,television,1454406210,Loooooooollipop,1,0,1.0,59.0,0.0

it s not too similar  but there s a lot of it s always sunny in philadelphia it s very clever  with occasional concept episodes  but it s also a lot darker than just about any sitcom i ve ever seen  archer is good  if you like animated sitcoms  it s set in a spy agency  i d also suggest better off ted it was a workcom set in an evil globalconglomerate it was definitely on the us netflix  and deserved way more than two seasons ,czkyml1,community,television,1454421342,video-kid,15,0,1.0,165.0,0.0
