i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length ,czrsqua,himym,television,1454901150,inmyslumber,1,0,395,7822,0.0

the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues ,d02lor9,himym,television,1455669552,AlvisDBridges,5,0,3539,14070,0.0
the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier ,d028pxx,himym,television,1455651218,blink5694,27,0,3653,13564,0.0

i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending ,d02lle8,himym,television,1455669414,LilliaHakami,3,0,1,654,0.0

as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a sitcom  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents ,d027h50,himym,television,1455649537,paul2520,16,0,1481,9161,0.0

great job  i have to praise how you handled the episode s transitions and the pacing in general i know there was a lot to cut out  but you managed to keep it pretty coherent  now for a bit of criticism  which may be very subjective so take it with a grain of salt  1 you said that daphne is hard to cut out  which i agree  but i think there were a couple of unnecessary scenes on the final cut  like the ones with clint and daphne s daughter  which makes her appear for half the film i know that it s there to teach marshall to stand up for himself  but i feel like he already learned that lesson when he decided to take the job without telling lily  2 after all that build up of marshall and lily s arc  it s kind of disappointing that it resolves so fast  or maybe i just really like the discussion marshall has with ghost lily  the one about keeping score   3 very minor things  when jeanette drops the locket there s a brief scene of young ted losing his balloon which does nt make much sense without context or when barney says that vengeance will soon be his and it s never explained what s he is talking about  his job   but this one i understand that you ca nt cut him midsentence  4 i m sad that the short scene where  barney finally passes the torch   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  gdckmrns  did nt make it or gary blauman s last scene  5 given how you decided to end the story  the official alternate ending narration would have worked much better imo  6 i almost forgot  you showed how everyone met tracy  except barney i feel like you should have squeezed that somewhere ,czpvy1f,himym,television,1454756177,henrykazuka,1,0,52,17047,0.0

there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same outcome  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something ,d02sjf4,himym,television,1455680230,Morningxafter,1,0,8298,50860,1.0

after seeing that popular internet meme of the study of violet  i began to think about all of the other colors introduced throughout the show and eventually came to see color symbolism as projections of character development and perceptions  at the beginning of right place  right time  ted says   the great moments in life wo nt necessarily be the things you do they ll also be great things that happen to you  so i began to see it as when the characters are associated with colors of the darker nature  purple  blue  green  these are symbolic of the characters pursuing something or attempting to make something happen while the other half of the wheel red  orange  yellow are symbolic of the things that happen to them  i ve made associations by the direct opposite colors as well  blue amp  orange purple amp  yellow green amp  red each color represents a theme of a type of desire or need that is fulfilled or unfulfilled the colors worn or associated with represent what that particular person represents to them each color is introduced as the following  blue french horn  the item that ted steals on his first date with robin to woo her purple giraffe  the toy robin reports during her news show that a little boy traps himself in a grabaprize machine to retrieve green suit that barney wears to a saint patrick s outing and convinces ted to join him by claiming there will be  no tomorrow  orange kangaroo  ted attempts to get stella a fake diamond ring from a grabaprize machine but gets a orange kangaroo to give to her instead red cowboy boots  a spontaneous purchase ted makes for himself but is disparaged by his friends for wearing yellow umbrella  item passed between ted and mother until they actually meet there s an episode where barney talks about  misdirection   which has been the theme throughout the entire series the way that a story starts has an unexpected ending given these events  i began to notice that each color represents types of expectations and how consequences correlate with types of wantsneeds blue  the pursuit for something wanted  ted wearing blue hues when deciding to betray zoey and declare arcadian as not a landmark  robin is wearing blue when she finds the box for the locket in central park empty  purple  the pursuit for something wanted without realizing the consequences   from the color theory meme  ted telling robin he loves her without realizing impact it will have on friendship robin initiating purple valentines  as a strike against valentine s day but having friends eventually find dates and introducing nora to barney nora wearing purple when about to introduce barney to her parents but not realizing he would break up with her green   no tomorrow   doing something wanted regardless of consequences ted wearing a green dress to challengesupport barney robin wearing a green dress to the night on the boat with barney  nora  and kevin orange   getting what you can get   ted at punchy s wedding  the wedding decorated in orange to represent needing to feel like he too was changing along with his peers from ohio even though they had other expectations and he had his building to brag about red   tomorrow   the loss of something to gain something needed robin wearing a red coat when realizing and reflecting over her infertility robin wearing a red dress when leaving ted in the limo to meet barney  who proposed on gnb tower robin wearing red when about to discuss divorce with barney in argentina yellow  something needed  an opportunity presented ted seeing the mother s little yellow bus when dating cindy nora wearing yellow when meeting barney thoughts ,43vw9c,himym,television,1454442231,Rinnylam,2,0,1,0,0.0

this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with robin i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that ,czh6oho,himym,television,1454122393,the_clown_prince,33,0,5862,2993,0.0

come on  i m going against the grain here by picking this instead of pilot or the pineapple incident from season 1  but this episode basically epitomizes what i loved about the series  how in tune it was with the real highs and lows of life it had the humor of barney throughout  the euphoria of ted finally getting with robin  but cue the ending scene  with marshall sitting on the steps in the rain while bloc party  this modern love plays in the backgroundi was heartbroken  and i was immediately hooked  slap bet  i love this episode for basically the complete opposite reasons i listed for  come on   this really was just a feelgood episode for me it showcased how great of friends the group really was it was just them hanging out  enjoying each other s company  and getting into all the dumb things friends get into when just sitting around doing nothing  besides finding out you re a canadian pop star   three days of snow  i really relate to this episode as someone who s now married  and has been with that person for nearly 10 years ted and barney s fiasco in the apartment during a blizzard was hilarious dude we should buy a bar but marshall and lily trying to keep up with doing the little things and making sure to keep the traditions alive after so many years together was something that really resonated with me great story editing  and loved the separate plots tying in together at the end  the leap  i started himym a few years after college  when i binged it all to catch up to season 9 while it was still airing i often think what it would have been like if i watched it live  the entire series that would have meant i would have started back in high school  and honestly i do nt think it would have hit home as hard as it did when i watched it this episode is the perfect example of that ted s voice over at the end of the episode  while they re jumping across  is something i do nt think i would have been able to relate to at an earlier age but watching it in my midtwenties  wow  this will forever be my favorite episode also  another win for himym s music supervisor with prophets playing at the end of the episode  the time travelers  i love this episode for many of the same reasons that i had for  come on   it was just an emotional roller coaster the humor in the middle of the episode had the feelgood vibes that i was accustomed to  but then ted s scene outside tracie s door comes out of nowhere josh radnor had a lot of great acting moments in the show  but to me this is his best him tearing up asking for 45 more days was one of the best moments in the whole series imo  ps thanks for the friday afternoon productivity drain  loved it the distraction ,czp7odt,himym,television,1454703448,Wynuride,2,0,1,88,0.0

to me  barney was a sociopath  i do nt get why people were rooting for him  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  it was  shelter island  that began my loathing of barney stinson he circled  get her drunk  and  emotionally vulnerable  on a whiteboard  as part of an elaborate  premeditated scheme to have sex with robin  regardless of her wishes there s a word for that  rapist  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  i offer  sandcastles in the sand  as further evidence robin was in a vulnerable state barney and robin lingered at the bar we saw robin drinking  probably scotch  the whole time and she had a headstart on barney he arrived late if barney had waited  even a few hours  till robin was stonecold sober and less heartbroken  would robin have consented to a tryst with barney  we know from  the goat  that robin was embarrassed and remorseful the next day whatever feelings barney might have had  it was his duty  as a friend  to resist barney took advantage of robin  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  compare this to  doppelgangers  in which robin was again heartbroken and vulnerable ted warns robin that he and she are drunk and he then seems hesitant when she leans forward yes  it was lucky for ted that his awesome hair broke the spell  he was pulling it off   but future ted notes that a relapse with robin that night would have been a terrible mistake by contrast  back in  the goat  we saw barney collecting  bpegs  for his mental harddrive he had no regret he said so ted is human and nearly stumbled  he was relieved that nothing happened without remorse  barney consciously set out to recreate  sandcastles in the sand  with his  shelter island  schemeamp  nbsp   utterly despicable  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  at this point  barney supporters try to tell me that he changed  over the years no his proposal was like the recruitment strategy for a cult the recruit is kept disoriented  under stress  for several weeks and then thrown a lifeline  which the recruit instinctively grabs once indoctrinated  a cult member never looks back to question the process it is the writers  not me  who chose a hannibal lecter metaphor by having robin put herself in a pit over barney  a  silence of the lambs  reference  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  in the eighth season  barney makes a big show of destroying the play book but that was a lie not only does he own a  hoebegone   he used it on robin even robin acknowledges that barney s entire courtship was built on lies it was not until the secondtolast episode that barney finally   finally  promises to be truthful with robin that is not consistent character growth that is too little  too late ,czthcu9,himym,television,1455030987,Mark_Zajac,4,0,1,27908,0.0

somebody on this sub a while back distinguished between  soulmate  and  love of life   and i think the distinction actually makes a lot of sense for the show  soulmate  means the one whom a character is most naturally matched for and drawn to  and for whom chemistry and timing both line up however  it is nt necessarily who that person spends their life with  usually because of circumstances out of their control  but sometimes because of the relationship itself    love of one s life  indicates the person that they may not be the most naturally matched for  but whom they are matched for  drawn to  and end up with ultimately and it applies to all the main characters in different ways  it should also be specified that these categories do nt necessarily imply romance   marshall and lily are both soulmates and the love of each other s lives they connect from the instant that they meet and do nt really ever let go of each other  barney s soulmate is robin  and robin s soulmate is barney but their natural chemistry  timing  and love for each other ca nt get them past themselves and their own careers  and they get divorced but barney s love of his life ends up being his daughter  ellie  whom he greets as the  love of his life  the very moment he first meets her and robin s love of her life ends up being ted  with whom she always had chemistry  but the wrong timing  tracy s soulmate is max  but he is taken from her by an early death she ends up with ted  whom she calls the  love of her life  in the show and who is with her to the very end  finally  and most important to the show overall  ted s soulmate is tracy  but she is taken from him by illness but the love of his life is robin  whom he knew for years and always felt drawn to  but without the right timing ted s telling of the story of how he met tracy occurs at the moment when chemistry finally meets timing for robin and ted  and when his kids give him their blessing to start dating again ,cztqz5n,himym,television,1455044433,bludevil22,2,0,1,2139,0.0

i agree with you op i just started watching himym last week and i ca nt stand ted  lilly and sometimes marshall  ted is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially robin  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  lilly also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to ted too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits barney a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like ted is to some girls  robin and marshall are okay but not as bad now barney definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why ted  lilly  evil and barney  awesome ,czsccbd,himym,television,1454950004,PrinceKael,-1,0,1,1031,0.0

the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues ,d02lor9,himym,television,1455669552,AlvisDBridges,5,0,3539,14070,0.0
the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier ,d028pxx,himym,television,1455651218,blink5694,27,0,3653,13564,0.0
i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending ,d02lle8,himym,television,1455669414,LilliaHakami,3,0,1,654,0.0
as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a sitcom  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents ,d027h50,himym,television,1455649537,paul2520,16,0,1481,9161,0.0

there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same outcome  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something ,d02sjf4,himym,television,1455680230,Morningxafter,1,0,8298,50860,1.0

thats actually a really good point while marshall never interfered with teds love life lily certainly had a hand in some break ups over the series  and with robin no longer an option at all along with barney out of his womanizing ways ted had the ability to nurture a relationship while not constantly around heavily codependant and meddling people nice fan theory ,d01xnqy,himym,television,1455635485,ProfessorPugh,90,0,83,1119,0.0

i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length ,czrsqua,himym,television,1454901150,inmyslumber,1,0,395,7822,0.0

i was rewatching the slap bet episode and i noticed something that really bugged me when marshall slapped barney prematurely and was wrong barney got two slaps on marshall but then when barney did the same thing to marshall lily made him choose between ten slaps immediately or five at any time  thats absurdly biased by lily and not at all fair the slap bet commissioner is supposed to be impartial ,45y57f,himym,television,1455563983,scrafem,4,0,3,296,0.0
to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair,d01ayvq,himym,television,1455582828,lordanubis79,5,0,1,3735,0.0

so  my little sister and i are having this argument over text messages  i asked her where was ted traveling when he got the nickname  el ganso con la ri  onera   i m pretty sure it was spain she says she just saw the episode and it was mexico so  does anyone remember where it was   edit  she took this picture from netflix as proof  http  imgurcomkg3pbgx but then  i found this youtube video  https  youtubecirhi1ak8sg and now we re even more confused ,43xwpv,himym,television,1454469205,javierglz,4,0,164,204,0.0

come on  i m going against the grain here by picking this instead of pilot or the pineapple incident from season 1  but this episode basically epitomizes what i loved about the series  how in tune it was with the real highs and lows of life it had the humor of barney throughout  the euphoria of ted finally getting with robin  but cue the ending scene  with marshall sitting on the steps in the rain while bloc party  this modern love plays in the backgroundi was heartbroken  and i was immediately hooked  slap bet  i love this episode for basically the complete opposite reasons i listed for  come on   this really was just a feelgood episode for me it showcased how great of friends the group really was it was just them hanging out  enjoying each other s company  and getting into all the dumb things friends get into when just sitting around doing nothing  besides finding out you re a canadian pop star   three days of snow  i really relate to this episode as someone who s now married  and has been with that person for nearly 10 years ted and barney s fiasco in the apartment during a blizzard was hilarious dude we should buy a bar but marshall and lily trying to keep up with doing the little things and making sure to keep the traditions alive after so many years together was something that really resonated with me great story editing  and loved the separate plots tying in together at the end  the leap  i started himym a few years after college  when i binged it all to catch up to season 9 while it was still airing i often think what it would have been like if i watched it live  the entire series that would have meant i would have started back in high school  and honestly i do nt think it would have hit home as hard as it did when i watched it this episode is the perfect example of that ted s voice over at the end of the episode  while they re jumping across  is something i do nt think i would have been able to relate to at an earlier age but watching it in my midtwenties  wow  this will forever be my favorite episode also  another win for himym s music supervisor with prophets playing at the end of the episode  the time travelers  i love this episode for many of the same reasons that i had for  come on   it was just an emotional roller coaster the humor in the middle of the episode had the feelgood vibes that i was accustomed to  but then ted s scene outside tracie s door comes out of nowhere josh radnor had a lot of great acting moments in the show  but to me this is his best him tearing up asking for 45 more days was one of the best moments in the whole series imo  ps thanks for the friday afternoon productivity drain  loved it the distraction ,czp7odt,himym,television,1454703448,Wynuride,2,0,1,88,0.0

the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues ,d02lor9,himym,television,1455669552,AlvisDBridges,5,0,3539,14070,0.0
the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier ,d028pxx,himym,television,1455651218,blink5694,27,0,3653,13564,0.0
i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending ,d02lle8,himym,television,1455669414,LilliaHakami,3,0,1,654,0.0
as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a sitcom  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents ,d027h50,himym,television,1455649537,paul2520,16,0,1481,9161,0.0

there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same outcome  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something ,d02sjf4,himym,television,1455680230,Morningxafter,1,0,8298,50860,1.0

this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with robin i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that ,czh6oho,himym,television,1454122393,the_clown_prince,33,0,5862,2993,0.0

main issue from my point of view  is that show s title and season 9  which should nt have happened  but extended due to shows  popularity  raised audiences expectations about the mother we sympathized for the mother due to her frequent appearances in s9  if i accept this alternate ending as the true ending  then i would feel just terrible for robin from the beginning  creators wanted robin to end up with ted i spent 8 years watching her getting along with the group instead  she ended up alone  regretting her decisions  cast aside  and prob live alone forever ,czifycs,himym,television,1454231738,jiwon0522,1,0,3010,2576,0.0

to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair,d01ayvq,himym,television,1455582828,lordanubis79,5,0,1,3735,0.0

somebody on this sub a while back distinguished between  soulmate  and  love of life   and i think the distinction actually makes a lot of sense for the show  soulmate  means the one whom a character is most naturally matched for and drawn to  and for whom chemistry and timing both line up however  it is nt necessarily who that person spends their life with  usually because of circumstances out of their control  but sometimes because of the relationship itself    love of one s life  indicates the person that they may not be the most naturally matched for  but whom they are matched for  drawn to  and end up with ultimately and it applies to all the main characters in different ways  it should also be specified that these categories do nt necessarily imply romance   marshall and lily are both soulmates and the love of each other s lives they connect from the instant that they meet and do nt really ever let go of each other  barney s soulmate is robin  and robin s soulmate is barney but their natural chemistry  timing  and love for each other ca nt get them past themselves and their own careers  and they get divorced but barney s love of his life ends up being his daughter  ellie  whom he greets as the  love of his life  the very moment he first meets her and robin s love of her life ends up being ted  with whom she always had chemistry  but the wrong timing  tracy s soulmate is max  but he is taken from her by an early death she ends up with ted  whom she calls the  love of her life  in the show and who is with her to the very end  finally  and most important to the show overall  ted s soulmate is tracy  but she is taken from him by illness but the love of his life is robin  whom he knew for years and always felt drawn to  but without the right timing ted s telling of the story of how he met tracy occurs at the moment when chemistry finally meets timing for robin and ted  and when his kids give him their blessing to start dating again ,cztqz5n,himym,television,1455044433,bludevil22,2,0,1,2139,0.0

to me  barney was a sociopath  i do nt get why people were rooting for him  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  it was  shelter island  that began my loathing of barney stinson he circled  get her drunk  and  emotionally vulnerable  on a whiteboard  as part of an elaborate  premeditated scheme to have sex with robin  regardless of her wishes there s a word for that  rapist  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  i offer  sandcastles in the sand  as further evidence robin was in a vulnerable state barney and robin lingered at the bar we saw robin drinking  probably scotch  the whole time and she had a headstart on barney he arrived late if barney had waited  even a few hours  till robin was stonecold sober and less heartbroken  would robin have consented to a tryst with barney  we know from  the goat  that robin was embarrassed and remorseful the next day whatever feelings barney might have had  it was his duty  as a friend  to resist barney took advantage of robin  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  compare this to  doppelgangers  in which robin was again heartbroken and vulnerable ted warns robin that he and she are drunk and he then seems hesitant when she leans forward yes  it was lucky for ted that his awesome hair broke the spell  he was pulling it off   but future ted notes that a relapse with robin that night would have been a terrible mistake by contrast  back in  the goat  we saw barney collecting  bpegs  for his mental harddrive he had no regret he said so ted is human and nearly stumbled  he was relieved that nothing happened without remorse  barney consciously set out to recreate  sandcastles in the sand  with his  shelter island  schemeamp  nbsp   utterly despicable  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  at this point  barney supporters try to tell me that he changed  over the years no his proposal was like the recruitment strategy for a cult the recruit is kept disoriented  under stress  for several weeks and then thrown a lifeline  which the recruit instinctively grabs once indoctrinated  a cult member never looks back to question the process it is the writers  not me  who chose a hannibal lecter metaphor by having robin put herself in a pit over barney  a  silence of the lambs  reference  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  in the eighth season  barney makes a big show of destroying the play book but that was a lie not only does he own a  hoebegone   he used it on robin even robin acknowledges that barney s entire courtship was built on lies it was not until the secondtolast episode that barney finally   finally  promises to be truthful with robin that is not consistent character growth that is too little  too late ,czthcu9,himym,television,1455030987,Mark_Zajac,4,0,1,27908,0.0

i agree with you op i just started watching himym last week and i ca nt stand ted  lilly and sometimes marshall  ted is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially robin  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  lilly also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to ted too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits barney a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like ted is to some girls  robin and marshall are okay but not as bad now barney definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why ted  lilly  evil and barney  awesome ,czsccbd,himym,television,1454950004,PrinceKael,-1,0,1,1031,0.0

great job  i have to praise how you handled the episode s transitions and the pacing in general i know there was a lot to cut out  but you managed to keep it pretty coherent  now for a bit of criticism  which may be very subjective so take it with a grain of salt  1 you said that daphne is hard to cut out  which i agree  but i think there were a couple of unnecessary scenes on the final cut  like the ones with clint and daphne s daughter  which makes her appear for half the film i know that it s there to teach marshall to stand up for himself  but i feel like he already learned that lesson when he decided to take the job without telling lily  2 after all that build up of marshall and lily s arc  it s kind of disappointing that it resolves so fast  or maybe i just really like the discussion marshall has with ghost lily  the one about keeping score   3 very minor things  when jeanette drops the locket there s a brief scene of young ted losing his balloon which does nt make much sense without context or when barney says that vengeance will soon be his and it s never explained what s he is talking about  his job   but this one i understand that you ca nt cut him midsentence  4 i m sad that the short scene where  barney finally passes the torch   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  gdckmrns  did nt make it or gary blauman s last scene  5 given how you decided to end the story  the official alternate ending narration would have worked much better imo  6 i almost forgot  you showed how everyone met tracy  except barney i feel like you should have squeezed that somewhere ,czpvy1f,himym,television,1454756177,henrykazuka,1,0,52,17047,0.0

after seeing that popular internet meme of the study of violet  i began to think about all of the other colors introduced throughout the show and eventually came to see color symbolism as projections of character development and perceptions  at the beginning of right place  right time  ted says   the great moments in life wo nt necessarily be the things you do they ll also be great things that happen to you  so i began to see it as when the characters are associated with colors of the darker nature  purple  blue  green  these are symbolic of the characters pursuing something or attempting to make something happen while the other half of the wheel red  orange  yellow are symbolic of the things that happen to them  i ve made associations by the direct opposite colors as well  blue amp  orange purple amp  yellow green amp  red each color represents a theme of a type of desire or need that is fulfilled or unfulfilled the colors worn or associated with represent what that particular person represents to them each color is introduced as the following  blue french horn  the item that ted steals on his first date with robin to woo her purple giraffe  the toy robin reports during her news show that a little boy traps himself in a grabaprize machine to retrieve green suit that barney wears to a saint patrick s outing and convinces ted to join him by claiming there will be  no tomorrow  orange kangaroo  ted attempts to get stella a fake diamond ring from a grabaprize machine but gets a orange kangaroo to give to her instead red cowboy boots  a spontaneous purchase ted makes for himself but is disparaged by his friends for wearing yellow umbrella  item passed between ted and mother until they actually meet there s an episode where barney talks about  misdirection   which has been the theme throughout the entire series the way that a story starts has an unexpected ending given these events  i began to notice that each color represents types of expectations and how consequences correlate with types of wantsneeds blue  the pursuit for something wanted  ted wearing blue hues when deciding to betray zoey and declare arcadian as not a landmark  robin is wearing blue when she finds the box for the locket in central park empty  purple  the pursuit for something wanted without realizing the consequences   from the color theory meme  ted telling robin he loves her without realizing impact it will have on friendship robin initiating purple valentines  as a strike against valentine s day but having friends eventually find dates and introducing nora to barney nora wearing purple when about to introduce barney to her parents but not realizing he would break up with her green   no tomorrow   doing something wanted regardless of consequences ted wearing a green dress to challengesupport barney robin wearing a green dress to the night on the boat with barney  nora  and kevin orange   getting what you can get   ted at punchy s wedding  the wedding decorated in orange to represent needing to feel like he too was changing along with his peers from ohio even though they had other expectations and he had his building to brag about red   tomorrow   the loss of something to gain something needed robin wearing a red coat when realizing and reflecting over her infertility robin wearing a red dress when leaving ted in the limo to meet barney  who proposed on gnb tower robin wearing red when about to discuss divorce with barney in argentina yellow  something needed  an opportunity presented ted seeing the mother s little yellow bus when dating cindy nora wearing yellow when meeting barney thoughts ,43vw9c,himym,television,1454442231,Rinnylam,2,0,1,0,0.0
