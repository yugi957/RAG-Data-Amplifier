so  i m in my first viewing of voyager  and i have to say that this is probably one of the funniest episodes i have seen so far  there are other pure comedy episodes but this one takes the cake the doctor is such a lovable character  looking for parmac  spelling   in all the wrong places  our man bashir  little green men  that episode with barclay in tng when he goes  james bondish   bride of chaotica  mmm those come to mind right now  i m certain there are others  but this one is just 45 minutes of grinning and laughing with a few  serious  moments to catch your breath  and i like it when star trek goes out of its way to make something lighthearted and fun amidst all the starfleet protocol  so anyway  season 6  and i have to say that voyager is way better than people make it out to be  it does have its problems  but if you are watching a series about a starship that can travel faster than the speed of light  a few extra shuttlecrafts or writers with hangover once in a while should not be your main focus  he caracters are great  just like every other series  even when they start very lame and unlikable  they grow on you a lot  even neelix  for example  piccard s1e1 was a dick  tucker s1e1 was generic texas boy  bashir uggghhh  even the sisko  you get the idea  anyway  i m getting close to complete the whole voyage  but looking forward to july and even more to 2017  llap ,465aty,startrek,television,1455665751.0,citizenofgaia,14.0,0.0,5229,4619,0.0
it took me quite i while to get into but i ended up enjoying enterprise  not quite as much as the others but still some good memories that is  when i wasnt getting angry at the forced love plot  with trip and tpol or the blatent and obscene sexing up of her character unlike many i enjoyed the long arch of the expanse  anyhow enough on that for now what else can scratch the trek itch  i havent gotten through all of ds9 yet mainly because i found the religious stuff hard to palate but if i got through all of enterprise s trangressions i imagine ds9 will be tame in comparison  what else is there non trek  since ive watched them all now apart from the remainder of ds9  i am trying babylon 5 again since it has alot of rave reviews and high sci fi cred from all ive read i dont expect super special effects but the show is so low budget i find it jarring and hard to get into i saw an episode with some ant creature and it was star trek original series bad and the sets seem so cramped it gives the impression of being filmed in someones backyard garage i will keep trying with it though maybe things smooth out  i mean tng was filmed before that by quite a few years and nearly always looked classy  i have been trying battlestar galactica but after a few episodes that seems like quite a mockery of the genre and grotesquely overrated i feel everything in life has continued to go downhill after the millenium everything was gold in the 80s and 90s  andromeda looks to be a sleeper hit i have on my rader  so what say ye all you star trek stalwarts  what will satisfy my yearning heart ,45yt86,startrek,television,1455571146.0,grimpydipso,1.0,0.0,1,-2,0.0

it always seems to be a rule to slow to impulse when you re in a system my guess is in crowded areas with many other ships or gravitational sources  the risk of getting your warp field disrupted is higher it could also be a precision thing stopping on a dime at warp 9 and then being in orbit can be problematic  making sure you do nt run into a planet or a achieve a stable orbit  if we believe the new movies  a warp field can be sustained under the gravitational force of a black hole  and without warp cores   but coming out of warp is coming out blind which could result in you coming out into a debris field ,czyqvsj,startrek,television,1455392758.0,starshiprarity,1.0,0.0,14,5542,0.0
in a nutshell  impulse power is used for sublight travel and warp is used for ftl speeds as far as i know  impulse power is not capable of achieving any ftl travel the quote from  star trek vi  the undiscovered country  is most likely a writing error  but i m sure explanations have been conceived of  in regards to  best of both worlds    star trek  has always been wildly inconsistent about its use of impulse versus warp power when in a star system dialogue has established multiple times that ships should travel at impulse power when in a star system for safety concerns however  visually  we see ships going to warp all the time when in a star system even worse  kirk and crew jump to warp in the   atmosphere   of earth in  star trek iv  the voyage home  ,czyqp66,startrek,television,1455392426.0,Tannekr,3.0,0.0,661,8512,0.0
there is no downside beside the shift in quality and style  but i did nt find that to be a problem either when it was initially broadcast or on a recent chronological rewatch there is a small amount of overlap  and voyager s pilot episode involves it being at ds9   but it s fairly minor background elements that wo nt make much of a difference  i prefer the broadcast order because i like those extra bits and you get the same context the production team expected  though you ca nt  really  go wrong with either approach ,czyst7e,startrek,television,1455396219.0,Dantonn,1.0,0.0,2419,80021,0.0
impulse power is highly inconsistent with measurements like  14 impulse  apparently measuring 14 the maximum output of a given vessel s impulse engines rather than a measurement of speed  14 impulse from a shuttle is very different from 14 impulse from a starship  the star trek voyager technical manual lists full impulse as 14th the speed of light if we assume that the enterprised engines have the same capability  although theirs may be slower or faster   then dropping out of warp around the orbit of neptune would put the ship  45 billion kms from earth  at full impulse  14 the speed of light   wolfram alpha says it d take 60042 seconds  or 1001 minutes  or 1668 hours which is nt too bad dropping out of warp closer to saturn  4725 hours  or jupiter  233 hours  would shave a considerable amount of time off that estimate  of course  tos has scotty saying that the romulan ships use  simple impulse  but still have interstellar capabilities  tl  dr  it s not clear,czytumk,startrek,television,1455398094.0,VonAether,2.0,0.0,12255,115613,1.0

let s just say  it s up to the screenwriter and plot   generally speaking  warp is between stars and impulse is between planets  however  we ve seen way too many instances of ships dropping out of warp conveniently right next to the planet they re going  and so on like in st  id  enterprise conveniently dropped out of warp right next to earth  if i remember elite  there are actually four drive systems the regular engines you fly around in  and combat with   the microjump that lets you travel forward a bit until you get too close to someone  jump drive to take you to another star system  depending on your fuel range   and galactic jump drive  take you to another galaxy    ,czz66pj,startrek,television,1455419994.0,kschang,1.0,0.0,3500,9520,1.0

the timelines are always affected in the same way  whether there is a loop or an alternate universe what is shown to the audience is simply a matter of perspective so yes  in the  prime  universe the enterprisec goes back to their own timeline and creates the loop that we accept in the canon  prime  timeline  but there is also an alternate universe where they do not return to their time it simply is nt shown to the audience because the loop is what defines the  prime  timeline  as uhmsbountya said  it s up to the writers  but i think that the distinction between different forms of time travel is moot when you look at the big picture that does nt mean this is nt an interesting  wellresearched article  just that there are a lot of semantics involved when the reality is that every possible timeline is occurring and not occurring simultaneously and the only people who define what is and is not part of the  prime  timeline are the writers  which is a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise interesting thought experiment ,czxk856,startrek,television,1455300936.0,mexicalien,3.0,0.0,1,23,0.0

i keep on saying this but this show is really good so far i really love how this show takes an idea and just takes it everywhere it can go it really appeals to me and i am really enjoying watching the next thing that they explore i feel like i have a lot to say this time around so let s get to it   redemption  part ii not really as good as part 1 but some solid battles and data got time to shine pretty cool   darmok very good it finally helped me understand the universal translator and it was a really solid view at language and culture exchange that kept an interesting core to avoid being dull   ensign ro i know the bajorans become important later and this was quite a good intro i had a hard time following the actual plot but ro was nice and it was saved by her character   silicon avatar the plot took a long journey before discovering what it was but what it was  was pretty damn good the story of revenge and the federation neglecting someone like that was very interesting and the ending was bold   disaster great character episode some cool and unusual pairings and great dialogue plot was ok too  i guess   the game while i did nt particularly desire to see wesley again this episode was nice and creepy but i ca nt say it s a new favourite of mine  either   unification very nice i liked seeing spock and the plot kept itself engaging throughout got slightly weaker when sela showed up but overall it was very well done and picard had a lot of great moments   a matter of honor i mean perspective i mean time certainly watchable but him being a conman was a bit obvious i liked some interactions between rasmussen and the crew but overall it was rather dull the actual problemsolving and picard s dilemma was really solid though   new ground not being a member of the fandom i do nt know what people think of alexander i think i quite like him the actor is really bad  but i like the way he acts as a foil for worf and he certainly brings something new to the show now the episode itself was pretty standard and only really got good during the ending   hero worship this was a fun episode  if a bit low on substance the child actor was  again  not that great but the episode was just a nice bit of fluff and there was some nice data scenes in there   violations well this episode was weird little actual plot and it was about rape overall i was nt that engaged but i did nt hate it either   the masterpiece society terribly dull it was way too much like a tos episode and troi romances seem to be doomed to be boring and unbelievably dumb but i did like the morality discussions quite a bit and that part was quite nice   conundrum really solid i liked the concept and the characters are explored from a whole new angle ro and riker have surprisingly good chemistry and the mystery aspect was well executed   power play the actors probably had a field day with this one and the possesed people did a bangup job of playing hose roles as for the actual plot i found the enterprise caper a lot more engaging than the old ship stuff and the ending did nt give me much but i ca nt say i dislike it   ethics great drama  if a bit soapy worf was very much in character but the real interesting stuff was between crusher and ellen degeneres  android clone ellenbot 3000 really did show the varied nature of people within the federation and she provided a different viewpoint in a believable way i mean you know they wo nt kill off worf but it was pretty nice to see him walking at the end   the outcast really good even if it does play it pretty safe in some areas the concept is interesting and wellexplored and the ending is wonderfully horrible  reminiscent of the city on the edge of forever i really liked soren s character and her and riker had a very genuine chemistry  maybe jonathan frakes just has chemistry with everyone   cause and effect loved it the looping was really well directed and executed and the plot got the concept across  while still moving forward and the characters got a chance to figure out a mystery   the first duty we are not allowed to forget wesley apparently but again  solid episode and putting a former main character in this morally wrong position and having picard absolutely fuming was a very bold choice and it gives some interesting insight into starfleet everyday   cost of living uhhhhhhh i did not need an alexandermama troi episode in my life i did nt get the holodeck scenes  alexander is kind of a twat and i was just not engaged surprisingly my favourite thing about it was lwaxana s relationship with her husbandtobe and the stuff around that   the perfect mate i feel really bad the episode is almost too good at presenting the metamorph character and the ending made me feel like shit the scenes with kamala and picard were fantastic  but i ca nt say i cared much for her scenes of seducing various men but as a concept episode it was pretty great what  there were ferengi in this episode  huh   imaginary friend more fucking children please stop doing this forever tng i was constantly groaning during this episode it mixes horrible child acting  the cassandra truth clich   a particular pet peeve of mine   and a moral issue that really did not need to be explored why did they make this   i borg absolutely fantastic it develops the borg in a great way and the various characters  response to everything was great prejudice  individuality and lot of interesting points are explored and hugh was great to see develop geordi got a chance to shine and the ending was kind of sad  but still ambiguous enough to be slightly hopeful   the next phase really liked it  the mystery was cool and the concept was well explored and the funeral planning and data stuff was just sweet as hell and i m really starting to love ro   the inner light  aka the one were picard becomes jorel  well that out of the way this one is popular and i mean i liked it it was great as an exploration of life and picard got some really good stuff i wanted to see the episode develop and the ending was absolutely great i can see why people have a fondness for it   time s arrow  part i love it data is wonderful as a french inventor and i am really excited to see where it goes i did nt care much for the alien stuff but people s reaction to the data death stuff was very nice looking forward to part 2   now keep in mind this is a long list and i might misremember some episodes  or give them a weird rating it s also like 330 am as i write this i also might have been a bit to favourable this time aorund

okay  as we know from tng  troi had to take a command test to gain the ability to become an official bridge commander  raising her from lt commander to full commander  why did nt data have to do that before tng as a series started in order to become second officer  he was directly in the chain of command  3rd    and is seen holding official command watches on the bridge during the whole show yet  at no point during or before the show did he have to take a test and become a full commander i do nt get it ,45qzl1,startrek,television,1455461283.0,emdeemcd,49.0,0.0,20008,44100,0.0
you have to take the test at some point in order to become a full commander  but that does nt mean you ca nt take it earlier as the second officer on the ship he would have been required to take it before assuming that role you ll notice how troi is outside of that chain of command  which i believe goes picardrikerdataworf   worf probably had also already taken that test as a bridge officer my assumption is  and i do nt know if this is ever directly talked about  that troi is nt officially a bridge officer she is officially a counselor  picard just has her work on the bridge so that she can sense feelings about people over the viewscreen ,czzkoey,startrek,television,1455461863.0,DnMarshall,49.0,0.0,62,57414,1.0
you have to take a test to stand bridge watches in the position to command the ship  there are nt tests to advance in rank as an officer one would assume that any person in a command position like data would have completed it years ago troi was more of an advisor on the bridge as her official position was ships counsellor the the direct chain of command did nt include her  on a ship you would stand watches in your division  with troi being in the medical field her watch duties would probably have been in medical and not on the bridge she decided that she wanted to also take watches on the bridge that is why she took the test  here is some information on it the bridge officers test is only for those that want to stand bridge watches and are not a command officer http  memoryalphawikiacomwikibridge_officer  27s_test data would not have had to take it as he was a command officer i do nt think trois promotion had anything to do with the test other than it gave her an edge in a ranking board ,czzkzde,startrek,television,1455462570.0,z9nine,17.0,0.0,1254,30616,0.0

it might be that the bridge officers test is something specific for officers and personnel that are not on a command  operations  or science track since troi and crusher are the only two we have canonical evidence of having taken the test  it might be one of many additional certifications an already commissioned officer can study and attain  analogous to how cadets at starfleet medical academy can take engineering extension courses  and likewise  crusher and troi s rank and promotions  as officers separate from the standard officer track  their promotion to commander should probably be considered differently as a medical rank and is not really analogous to a commander in command  operations  or sciences ,czzuv0e,startrek,television,1455480071.0,rextraverse,2.0,0.0,95,6959,0.0

i ve seen it stated that into darkness is the worst of the star trek films although i was annoyed they used the same villain for a third time and redid scenes from the wrath of kahn  seriously  no one could come up with a unique script    but i recently rewatched star trek  the motion picture and star trek 5  the final frontier  and to me they still seem way worse than into darkness  what are your thoughts ,45xtzi,startrek,television,1455560323.0,mitachoo,0.0,0.0,422,49,0.0
star trek v is considerably worse  that said  the director of this film rehashing a previous popular film in a franchise seems to be a recurring trend  some of the criticism of into darkness does seem to come from individual political opinions rather than actual constructive cinema critique again  curious given the next film the director worked on ,d00wj9x,startrek,television,1455561306.0,crapusername47,6.0,0.0,9886,76645,1.0

stid is probably the most divisive movie to  people  in general nonfans loved it  something i have on good authority from the people who i know that are both movie buffs far more hardcore than i and nonfans of the franchise as a whole   fans hated it  at least  the most vocal fans anyway  i quite enjoyed it despite some apparent flaws   my perception is that stid and st  v have the opposite problems  final frontier has reasonably strong characterization with both the villain and the main trio  while everything else suffers greatly stid  stripped of it s strelated baggage  was actually a very well made action movie  but the characterization of the main trio of characters  with uhura subbing in for mccoy  and the main villain was weak  i ll still take stid and spock s crappy  khaaan  over the fan dance and awful special effects of final frontier though  any day of the week and while sybok seemed like a more nuanced villain  what he lacked was any ability to project the menace and sense of danger that a good villain should  something that khan  for the character s flaws  managed to do quite well  as for the people who complain about  magic blood  and some of the film s seemingly sillier embellishments we re talking about a movie based on a show that featured space greeks  space nazis  guntoting space romans and space lincoln next to that  giant blackops ships  cryogenics torpedoes and magic blood is downright tame ,d01kd35,startrek,television,1455597960.0,MasterXaios,3.0,0.0,1,75,0.0

i ve given some thought to how the upcoming show can return to the original spirit of gene roddenberry s vision while still looking to the future   what the show needs to be  quite simply  everything that the jj reboots are not  and everything that tng  ds9 and voyager are   the scene amp  what i think would make a dynamic crew  1  the timeline should be the original tog  tng  voyager  ds9 timeline  2  the show should start 100 years after the end of tng this way meaningful references can be made to prior shows and it would nt feel like a totally different universe  3  the ship should be the enterprise assuming that after tng there were 2 other enterprises this show will start on the 3rd enterprise following tng  4  the captain should be a black earth woman  with a strong moral center  5  the first officer should be a human male with a  trip  type personality from the enterprise show probably from the american south  somewhere like louisiana  6  the science officer should be a female vulcan  7  there should be a new generation of male datatype droid on the crew as one of the helmsmen  8  one of the other main helmsmen should be a female andorian  9  the tactical officer should be a japanese male  with strong cultural ties to ancient samurai  10  the ship counselor should be something like a male yogi  or a buddhist type personality  11  the chief medical officer should be a female cardassian  with a male human assistant a human emh program should make periodical appearances also  12  the chief engineer should be a russian male  get an actual russian actor who speaks fluent english    the universe since tng  ds9  discarding all the extended universe  wiki stuff  a la star wars   1  cardassia has joined the federation after it s destruction at the end of ds9 they have committed to rebuilding their society as a peaceful  antiwar civilization  2  after their ruin while fighting the dominian war  the klingon empire has struggled to rebuild they committed to a huge armament buildup program and since ds9 have been fighting to regain their honor they are seen throughout the federation as  once mighty warriors  who have lost everything 3  the neutral zone with the romulans still exists and the political situation with the romulans is unchanged since the end of ds9 although the romulans have been slowly expanding on the other side of the neutral zone into new territory the romulans have also formed a temporary alliance with the tholians to fight the klingons in total war of destruction against the klingons the klingons retain most of their territory and are going through a lot of  soul searching   4  the breen have begun active expansion into the gamma quadrant 5  the borg are having difficulty retaking lost territory after their collective was almost destroyed at the end of voyager the borg has developed internal factions fighting for freedom they are not as strong as they once were  but they are nastier and more ruthless than before  6  the gamma and delta quadrants are still largely unexplored  7  after all the conflicts ended with tng and ds9  federation citizens desired an era of peace  which has lasted 100 years so far  something akin to  pax romana  has been taking place for federation citizens  exploration has come to mean conflict and making new enemies and running into trouble  they are simply tired of conflict an isolationist mentality has spread through the land the spirit of starfleet has dimmed there is little political support to help the klingons in their war for survival  but because of the alliance  starfleet must commit at least a minimum of support federation citizens have become apathetic  complacent  lethargic and unmotivated joining starfleet means nothing anymore in the complacency  enemies of the federation have started slowly infiltrating the society  attempting to deteriorate it from the inside by encouraging corruption  petty disputes  political rivalries and a dumbing down of society in general the enemies of the federation are clearly engaged in a secretive divide and conquer strategy   the show  each season would have an overarching theme and title  which would appear next to the episode name  season 1 title should be something like   we were explorers once  the premise  the new starfleet president feels passionately that starfleet needs to be reenergized with a new mission the complacency must end the new enterprise and several other flagships are sent on highly publicized missions of exploration into the gamma quadrant through the bajoran wormhole this new exploration initiative is an attempt to reignite a feeling of nostalgia in federation citizens  a way back to the way things were long ago starfleet calls this the  new frontier project   the isolationists are disturbed by this and protests erupt  even sabotage is attempted the enterprise encounters more nonhumanoid species than humanoids  but most of them are not so warm towards humanoids the enterprise does not understand why all the discrimination against humanoids  season 2 title should be something like   the values we hold dear  the premise  the enterprise is still deep in the gamma quadrant exploring but there is increasing political turmoil back home inside the federation being immune from the happenings back home  the enterprise continues on its interesting mission  but ca nt help being pulled into the political drama once in a while  even being as far away as the gamma quadrant with the help of new  microwormhole detection technology   the crew of the enterprise can make visits to the alpha quadrant in a shuttle pod only once a stable microwormhole is detected meanwhile  while continuing to explore the gamma quadrant  the enterprise continues to find that the gamma quadrant is filled more with nonhumanoid races than humanoids the enterprise discovers that in the gamma quadrant the few humanoid races have created a xenophobic alliance of sorts and discriminate against nonhumanoids nonhumanoids see the humanoids as isolated  scared  angry and primitive  season 3 title should be something like   civil war  the premise  a large splinter faction is seceding from the federation  similar to the american civil war the enterprise must take a side and help to put an end to the conflict in some way battles worthy of  song and story  appear in this season this is one of the darkest hours of the federation since it s beginning in some way  the klingons and romulans are part of this  season 4 title should be something like   fortune favors the bold  the premise  with the civil war ended  the people of the federation have reignited their soul and realized that they either move into the future together  boldly and united  or the entire experiment falls to pieces the people realize that the federation is the only thing preventing the galaxy from plunging into the dark ages of endless territorial wars a new spirit of exploration and peacekeeping is born from the ashes of the destruction at home in a symbol of unity  half of the enterprise crew is replaced with personnel from the former opposing faction the enterprise enters the gamma quadrant  this time  from the other side to explore new territory  and not through the bajoran wormhole the enterprise is having a hard time finding friends in nonhumanoid races due to the prejudice which exists in the gamma quadrant the enterprise decides it s up to them to forge new alliances with nonhumanoids and to break old prejudices  season 5 would be all about exploration with no interruption from federation political drama this season would include an appearance from the borg for the first time  season 6  7 would go from there  a show like this would give us a good mix of exploration  political drama  war  and most importantly the constant testing of federation morals and values ,460v1h,startrek,television,1455598132.0,Trake4,0.0,0.0,1,-9,0.0

it amuses me to no end that so many fans moan and complain trek shows and films that take a more action heavy approach while at the same time crapping all over tmp because it was too slow and too  boring   i used to have the same mindset  i always enjoyed tmp but when i was younger  i was more likely to pop the star trek ii or star trek vi tape in the vcr this changed when i actually sat down and really payed attention to the film i put aside my misplaced expectations of what i thought it was supposed to be and actually looked at it for what it is  at the end of the day  tmp is probably as close to the true spirit of star trek that we will ever get in a film it was not afraid to be a bit slow if it meant that we could really understand the scale of what was happening it does have some pacing issues but the overall plot of the film  the basic ideas of it  really worked  now  perhaps it gets a lot of flak because it has a jarringly bad color pallet  the pastel uniforms were never a good idea  but i suspect that a big part of the dislike it gets is down to how the characters were handled people go into it expecting the status quo of the tos crew to be unchanged but this film took a different tack  it showed us a crew that had not been around each other for a while  a crew that felt a bit cold and distant because that is _exactly_ what they were supposed to be like in the story  as far as star trek v goes  i generally find that it was poorly executed and severely underfunded but the basic idea is very true to star trek in fact  i think it really captures of the tos episode feel really well and that alone is worthwhile to me the final frontier is a film that stumbles a lot but i do nt think it has earned much of the arbitrary hate it receives  into darkness is a different case like the 2009 reboot  it was made by someone with only a surface level understanding of trek and it shows it tries to take on a challenging contemporary topic  911  justification for war  corrupt military leadership  but the execution of those ideas felt hollow  as if such details were a waste of time that was better spent on action scenes  the action was also a issue i have no issue with action in trek but only if it supports the story and characters i found the reboot and into darkness took the opposite approach and instead constructed thin  weak stories just to support the action scenes i suspect a lot of interesting dialogue was cut in favor of pushing ever forward towards the next shootout or fist fight as if that is the goal of trek alone  finally  into darkness is kinda tragic in that we actually did see some inkling of what it could have been with kirk s character we see hints of what could have been a more developed plotline where circumstances push him to grow past the aggressive character we are introduced to in the 2009 reboot we got parts of that but it was just too little when compared to the kinda mindless action scenes  into darkness was a decent and kinda slick action film but not much else  it lacked the substance that one should expect from a trek story ,d010oxl,startrek,television,1455567257.0,StarTrekMike,4.0,0.0,46,33953,1.0

i think it s got to do with how the line of command works  troi and doctor crusher were both medicalline officers  and so they did nt automatically have authority over people outside of their departments except in medical and psychological matters  there was probably some starfleet regulations which made it that medical officers could nt be put in command unless they demonstrated to the captain or the xo that they were capable of it  i do nt think this was as big a deal for officers in the engineering  operations or security departments over the course of their careers  they were more likely to be put in charge of away teams or small teams to do things onboard so  over the course of the years  they d gain experience commanding small numbers of people and would eventually be allowed to command larger numbers of people  even wesley was put in charge of a science group for that one episode  i m thinking it was called pen pals  i might be wrong   this was because he was being trained for a commandline position in the long run chances are that  had he chosen to stay in starfleet  he would nt have had to take the same kind of command test that troi had  or if he did  it would have only been a formality  this was nt really the case for people in the medical department they were stuck doing medical work in sickbay for the most part because that was their job  i think the command test was probably designed mostly for people from the medical line who decided they wanted command of a ship eventually the promotion to full commander was probably just an honourary thing  and did nt automatically put them in the ship s line of command unless the captain decided that would be the case  the real test for people who wanted to gain their own command would be the kobayashi maru test  or something similar to it even for someone who d been in the command line their entire career  it s hard to know how they re going to respond to that kind of situation unless they re tested for it  so they give them the simulation  the test troi took would probably have been considered a kobayashi maru for people in the medical line ,d009vv5,startrek,television,1455506932.0,JustBecomes6PM,3.0,0.0,662,1077,0.0

into darkness is not the worst it is  however  the most offensive to fans  from a production standpoint  the film is on point the sets  the uniforms  the effects  the acting is pretty much top notch in my opinion the script is weaker than expected sure  and the redo of wok scenes and lazy plugs like super blood and trans warp beaming are awful i hated the trans warp beaming in the first reboot film too  and thought that was weak the fact that they reused it was awful we expected something more out of this movie  i ve seen every trek film in theatres since generations  and into darkness left me the most disappointed after i left the theatre the 2009 reboot left me curious i thought  hey maybe they have a plan and this could be really cool going forward then into darkness came out and i suddenly realized my beloved trek had been steamrolled over and handled incredibly carelessly  it s a sentiment most fans feel they love trek so when it s mishandled its very frustrating ,d013mnr,startrek,television,1455571483.0,hulksmashokayiwill,3.0,0.0,15083,11832,0.0

i really think there s a great trek film hidden under that shitty bland blockbuster trailer  simon pegg  avid trekkie  super talented writer and nerd messiah  is writing the script justin lin  tos fan growing up and one of the best action directors in hollywood is helming the film  yes  he s the director of the  fast amp  furious  films  but let s not act like  fast five  and  fast amp  furious 6  were nt very welldirected and two of the best films in the franchise he was able to direct a large starstudded ensemble cast including vin diesel  dwayne johnson  paul walker  michelle rodriguez  among other big names  and should do just as good with this large cast another film of lin s that gets great reviews is  better luck tomorrow   it even has john cho  sulu  in it i think he s a fine choice  i just hope he does nt make some  star trek  the fast amp  furious  type film  i m cautiously hyped there s nothing wrong with a trek action film  the real problem is sloppy mindless writing which i felt into darkness had star trek 09 was nt the most intellectual or thoughtful either  but it was fine for what it was  a fun reboot and origin of the original cast  now it s time to step it up  do nt repeat into darkness  mistakes let s hope they do nt screw it up during the 50th anniversary of all things ,czxp7uh,startrek,television,1455307952.0,Fruit_Pastilles,46.0,0.0,6417,16644,0.0

in  alliances   during the scene when all the kazon leaders enter the room for their big meeting  there are sound effects of somewhat silly ceremonial horns and an audience whistling and clapping as each one enters  i would be willing to say the horns are just part of the background music  or perhaps being provided by some kazon bugle boy off screen  but the clapping  there is nobody else in the room other than the voyager crew members the voyager members are seen during the moments we hear the clapping and they are clearly shown to not be the source of it  is the clapping supposed to be some prerecorded stock footage sound effect the kazon leaders play over hidden speakers whenever they enter a room together  just kind of seemed odd to me  made me feel like i was watching a sitcom for a minute ,45wh77,startrek,television,1455543300.0,sabrefudge,43.0,0.0,38763,89492,1.0

quick recap  a mysterious ship scans the enterprise  everybody s memories are selectively wiped  actually just blocked   data s memory is similarly unavailable  and the ship s computer memory banks are firewalled off to be almost useless dr crusher devises a brainstimulation treatment to restore the crew s memories  but an alien infiltrator  cmdr macduff  fakes a seizure to prevent them from using it eventually the enterprise crew exposes macduff s plot  everything unravels in the last few minutes of the episode  and it s explained in exposition that they used dr crusher s brain stimulator to restore the crew s memories  question  nobody mentions poor data s fate at the end of that episode his memory appears to be fine  but i assume the medical treatment could nt be applied to him so how was his memory restored   did i overlook something  or did the writers just sort of hurry past that and hope we would nt notice ,45s8ph,startrek,television,1455475438.0,icamefromamonkey,5.0,0.0,174,15931,0.0

this might sound strange  but i think the best episode of ds9 to introduce someone who has zero knowledge of the series is  the adversary  it s a quality episode that gives a good introduction to most of the characters  except dax imo   it s action oriented and easily digestible  it shows what the main villains are capable of and why they should be feared  and finishes with the promise of escalating conflict to come it certainly does nt fill in all the backstory  but i think it s the best episode to pique someone s interest ,d02fn0w,startrek,television,1455660411.0,MasterXaios,1.0,0.0,1,75,0.0

bryan fuller work on hannibal i think will be a great stepping stone for new trek here s the reasons why  1  fuller proved that he can write characters that make convincing professionals this may not seem like a big deal  but writing a convincing doctor  lawyer  psychologist etc is hard to do this is a strong sign that he is able to maintain a certain level of dignity that we ve seen with characters such as spock  picard  data  and mccoy  2  he can mix common denominator topics  blood and gore etc  with higher brow concepts and intermix the two seamlessly time and time again we saw what would be run of the mill slasher plots on the show expand into topics that are far deeper and more complex than they would appear on the surface  3  he is skillful at adapting psychological topics without seeming like he s reading the idea from a wikipedia page whatever the next series will be it d be a huge failure  if massive popularity of psychology was nt voiced more strongly in a series  4  he understands visuals and admits openly that he writes for the camera lens and not for the screenplay considering our expectations for cgi are intensely high  it s great to know that we have a frontrunner that can use cgi to it s maximum effect  i expect to see some real sciency type imagery  5  he s developed a strong set of techniques for shooting on a budget obviously the budget of this show will be very high  however i think it d be great if the budget can be focused on delivering big scale action  and not wasted on filler the fact that he understands how to write huge amounts of dialogue that can be filmed on a single set is a real blessing for the series  6  he s great at writing mysteries even if it s out of details that may appear to be trivial  the guy is a master of revealing and hiding things without seeming like its done for simple shock value  7  this series will be full of villans it s a topic that we all resonate with  gul dukat  q  the borg  tamerlane  khan  general chang the fact that nutrek has worked hard to establish villans only furthers the idea that the series will require some well written villainy  ps he knows how to have fun too  although that is nt from his hannibal experience ,45f47m,startrek,television,1455289589.0,CommanderStarkiller,4.0,0.0,29,1246,0.0

it does do pretty well when compared to  most  other trek games  it certainly got the basic trek idea down far better than titles like elite force 12  armada  and even stuff like bridge commander  which had the best ship combat but literally nothing else going for it   if there is one thing i am not fond of about a final unity   even when i first played it as a kid   it is that the puzzles were too puzzle like  i always felt like it had some great moments but a lot of the game felt like a fairly generic  and somewhat untrek like  adventure title with a trek coat of paint ,czx2bea,startrek,television,1455259857.0,StarTrekMike,2.0,0.0,46,33953,1.0

i have seen tos and am currently watching tng season 6 thanks to user umhb210 post of selected list of episodes from tng s01 and s02 its been good in general since s03 since the next step is ds9  i am wondering to watch or to skip i have been hearing contrary views online  some say its boring and they could not sit through it  while some say it is the best so i am not sure its 7 seasons long  150 episodes and is going to take a lot of my download bandwidth  while the views are contradictory  most people seem to agree s01 and s02 of ds9 are just as bad as tng ,45lx72,startrek,television,1455388903.0,Prabhanarayan2000,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0
gt  most people agree s01 and s02 of ds9 are just as bad as tng  whaaaat ds9 s second season is really good imo that s the season when ds9 really hit its stride  and honestly  while s1 is uneven  and weaker than the subsequent ds9 seasons  i do nt think it s really a bad season by itself the pilot is excellent  and the season also contains one of the defining episodes of the entire series   duet  opinions will vary widely on this  but personally i d even go as far as to say that ds9 season 1 s low point   move along home   is nt nearly as bad as the low points of tng s first season   code of honor    then again  i do nt hate  move along home  as much as some other people do it s dumb  but pretty inoffensive ,czypzbp,startrek,television,1455391168.0,bugsdoingthings,9.0,0.0,1,43284,0.0

generally speaking  tos and tng are equal parts technobabble filled particle of the week  mysteries  and deep introspective humanism ds9 is more skewed towards the huminisim  and voyagerent are more skewed towards the technobabble  if you enjoyed watching debates about ethics  and the meaning of life  the universe  and everything  then ds9 might be for you if you just liked turning off your brain and watching cool space stuff  then not so much  having said that  the dominion war has hands down some of the best  most intense action in the trek universe  dominion war also contains a very long  seven season  storyline that involves an incredibly cerebral deconstruction of war amp  duty amp  thing things people do to protect the people they care about imo  it is definitely worth the slog through the boring parts of s1 amp  s2  through the slow build in s3 and s4 to the huge payoff in s5 and s6  when the war breaks out  it is all out no holds barred huge battles between dozens  if not hundreds  of ships are a regular occurrence millions dead tragedy after glorious tragedy  until it culminates in a crescendo of phaser and polaron beams  photon and quantum torpedos  in short  it is pretty epic ,czysdcl,startrek,television,1455395429.0,xhrit,5.0,0.0,405,3733,0.0

i am going through ds9 for the second time right now  just finishing s2 the first time i hated the first two seasons but this time with the exception of one episode in particular  many people probably know which episode i m referring to  i m really enjoying the first two seasons that being said i feel like you need to watch the first few to understand the rest of the series which is very very good it s different from tng but just as good ,czyxqxn,startrek,television,1455405048.0,ozakalwe,1.0,0.0,28,792,0.0
i ve seen bits and pieces of star trek throughout my life  but recently i decided to do a complete watch of all the series so far ive gotten through tos and tng and just started ds9 as much as i enjoy it  the implementation of the star date really bothers me the main reason is this  each 1000 star date represents roughly 1 year of earth time this is seen both in tos  stardate ranges from 1312 to 5928 while real years range from 2265 to 2269  and in tng  each season represents 1000 stardate  and there is a lot of dialogue suggesting that 1 season is equal to 1 year   this would indicate that the difference in time between tos  stardate  13006000  and tng  stardate  4100048000  should be on the order of 40 years or so  plus or minus a few years however  tng takes place in the 2360 s  which is 100 years after tos  how is this reconciled  edit  this is really too bad i want to like the idea of a star date  but they just implemented it so poorly ,45x68t,startrek,television,1455552772.0,jkool702,45.0,0.0,1,67,0.0

the most indepth examination which i ve seen into how stardates work  is here   http  starchivecsumanitobaca  stardates   the tl  dr is that he theorizes that the stardate system began close to the founding of the ufp  and then it ran to 99999 before cycling back over to 00000 it kept cycling until some point after the classic movie era  when they realized that ships  like the galaxy class ships  would be going on longer and longer missions  necessitating longer ranges of stardates so rather than resetting to 00000  it increased to 100000 we come into tng when it s reached about 410000 ,d00zq5c,startrek,television,1455565846.0,VonAether,4.0,0.0,12255,115613,1.0

have nt seen it here yet  so  the general consensus is that tos stardates run on a different system from tng et al stardate 411537 does not mean  35 years since  stardate 5928 at some point  probably 2323  extrapolating back  they recalibrated the system for whatever reason  this is generally okay  although the new films throw a  third  system into the mix they seem to use a system that corresponds to the actual earth date   223304  meaning early 2233   the kelvin was using this system  so it was a prime system in use before tos  the reboot enterprise also uses it  which means that in that timeline they kept the earthcentric system in place  the issue arrives when nuspock enters the jellyfish and the computer gives him a stardate of 2387 the jellyfish was from the tng era of the prime timeline  so the stardate  should  have been something 64000 did the computer universallytranslate the time to something nuspock understood  or did starfleet go  back  to the earthcentric system sometime between nemesis and nero ,d014nbc,startrek,television,1455572971.0,Antithesys,3.0,0.0,6253,70338,1.0
i like the idea of a decimal day calendar stardate 0 equals day 1  and stardate 10000  equals day 10 thousand this makes each 1000 stardates equal to 27 yeras ,d00sp7m,startrek,television,1455555711.0,CommanderStarkiller,1.0,0.0,29,1246,0.0
not sure of the exact system  but my  omega canon   head canon  has always been that the first digit in tos stardates denotes the year of the mission 1xxxx stardates correspond to the first year  5xxxx to the last year  yes  i know it does nt work when you take tas stardates into consideration no  i do nt know how to resolve it  except to say that tas stardates are wrong and the tos stardates are right ,d01b5q3,startrek,television,1455583136.0,Blue_Dog_Democracy,1.0,0.0,407,14347,0.0

k  i just finished ds9 it was amazing but you already know that  my question is about stuff happening simultaneously like  presumably gen takes place during ds9  right  because it s after tng ends so what s going on aboard ds9 while picard is trying to stop soaryn  i know that in fc  we see worf commanding the defiant  a nod to ds9 but when did i see worf get called away from the station to fight the borg at earth  like  the borg are scarcely mentioned in ds9 if the borg were literally attacking earth  there d be some mention of it on ds9 sisko would probably get called away to command a ship  probably the defiant tbh  stuff like this bugs me i try to dismiss this stuff and accept that these filmsshows are all made by different groups of people who do nt necessarily sit down and iron out continuity issues but it always kinda nags at me that there are so many times when things do nt quite jive  then there s the ferengi boy  they changed in ds9 it almost feels like ds9 is nt even star trek sometimes it s amazing  entertaining  wellacted  wellwritten and a generally great show but it does nt feel like it fits in alongside tos or tng but about the ferengi  in tng  they re portrayed as pirates  thieves  and so on the first contact with them was about stolen equipment and the ferengi in that episode had those cool electricity whips why did i never see those again  there were tons of ferengi in ds9 they were nt pirates or thieves  though they were traders and swindlers they never seemed to use weapons  except that psychopath that quark brought to save his mom from iggy pop   that s so different than the tng ferengi that would commandeer the enterprise a ds9 ferengi would trick you into legit selling him your ship for peanuts a tng ferengi would hijack your ship with force see the difference  again  i know there s a lot of creative reasons why these things happened different teams  different producers  different writers and directors i get it it s just weird how different ds9 feels than anything else  i ve just started voyager now i m 5 episodes in and i like it  but it definitely feels more like tng  and that s another thing  voyager disappears while pursuing maquis  presumably somewhere near ds9  why is there no mention of this in ds9  i know in the first ep of voyager  they depart from ds9 and quark is there but you d think there would be a ds9 episode where they mention something about voyager leaving to pursue maquis  all in all  i love each st entity i ve seen  even the films that everyone says are terrible but it does bug me to see stuff like this these things are taking place in the same universe  why ca nt they be a bit more tied together  unless they are and i just missed the explanations for this stuff  which is totally possible ,45yz06,startrek,television,1455573200.0,Ramza_Claus,0.0,0.0,15760,127356,0.0
generations takes place a couple years into ds9 it s before worf shows up  so there s no real question of how he got to the enterprise  and you did nt see worf get called away you did nt see every event of every day on ds9 it s something you just did nt see timing of lining up shared universe movies with tv shows like what marvel does did nt really happen back then it would have been unreasonable to expect that of ds9  as for the ferengi  yes  ds9 changed them a lot did they change them more than tng changed klingons i d argue no they changed the appearance of klingons they changed the general attitude of klingons in tos we do nt see the klingons with hand based weapons  but in all other shows it s made known that is how the klingons prefer to fight  yeah  there s some continuity stuff among aliens it happens across a lot of series it does nt really happen too badly in voyager  but they mostly created their own aliens also  i personally think ent was really great about that but ds9 and tng both made changes in aliens ,d015rq7,startrek,television,1455574653.0,DnMarshall,1.0,0.0,62,57414,1.0

watching tng from the beginning  only halfway through s2  but i am sort of annoyed with worf this time through  worf never lived among klingons  yet speaks of all their customs  culture  cuisine as if he had first hand intimate knowledge of them  further  he takes great pride in something that he has no part of whenever talking about their fighting  weapons  all of the above  he s very proud  a sentiment that does nt make sense from the perspective he has of his race  just my thoughts on it ,46083h,startrek,television,1455588840.0,Adam_Nox,6.0,0.0,1,-20,0.0
1  worf was 6 when his biological parents died before then he was raised by klingons you learn and pick up a lot in 6 years you do nt think that his family talked to him about honor and taught him how to fight by the time he was 6  2  while on earth growing up  worf was made aware that he was different he would get into fights  he accidentally killed a kid during a soccer game his klingonness was a source of differentness i think it would be normal for him to fantasize about his original culture to fantasize about a place he fit in part of that would involve learning as much about it as he could  3  his adoptive parents wanted him to embrace his klingonness as much as possible while fitting in in the federation they would have encouraged him to learn about his culture  replicated his foods  helped him with customs  i think the question is  who made you the gatekeeper who decides who the real klingons are ,d01hi4q,startrek,television,1455593139.0,DnMarshall,17.0,0.0,62,57414,1.0

a couple of things  worf lived with klingons until he was six  but more importantly  when he was 15 he moved to qonos and lived with cousins it was there her performed his rite of ascension and really had full immersion on klingon culture  i like to think that because it was so romanticized  he really appreciated klingon culture deep within his core ,d01kexm,startrek,television,1455598055.0,cptaixel,10.0,0.0,19662,10190,0.0
more to the point  i think it s an interesting statement about race other klingons did nt take  being klingon  as seriously as worf did  something i think jadzia this mentions to him   i think it s because of his hybrid identity experience that he makes such a big deal out of performing klingonness  it speaks to a big insecurity in worf s identity that s always how i read it ,d0245ye,startrek,television,1455645059.0,mcslibbin,2.0,0.0,17,13478,0.0

forgive my lack of actual military knowledge  that is why i am asking the group this question  so wesley crusher is given a field commission to the rank of an ensign he is subsequently seen wearing an official uniform and pips on his collar is this common  and what happens to this rank when he later goes to starfleet academy as a cadet  it seems a bit unfair to those fellow cadets who start in wesley s cadet class who may have never served on a starship  when wesley has been serving for years as an acting ensign and now an actual ensign also does wesley have to attend the entry level classes explaining the very basics of star fleet  so many questions ,45zmcp,startrek,television,1455580705.0,davect01,3.0,0.0,1263,9550,0.0
the idea of someone getting a field commission is probably not unheard of  though it s likely more common in situations like voyager  or after a major battle in the dominion war also probably not with 1415 year olds  when he went to the academy the rank went away it would have looked good on his resume and probably fast tracked him for promotion if he d graduated the academy  as opposed to running off with the traveler  but it would have meant very little at the academy directly  as to fairness to other cadets  it s probably no different than someone who d done high school internships in their field of study going to college today you ve got a bit more knowledge  but as long as you do nt treat your fellow students like you re better than them  which i ca nt really see wesley doing  they likely would nt consider it a bad thing  and he probably would have been a popular studybuddy  and he probably would have been able to get out of the truly introductory level classes  but i doubt it was automatic  he d likely have to take a challenge exam to do so ,d01bygi,startrek,television,1455584437.0,feor1300,2.0,0.0,1090,130544,0.0
field promotions are usually done for filling in officer positions for a unit that lots several officers  entd does nt need another ensign  and remember  wesley s rank is actually  according to picard   acting ensign   acting whatever basically is  you get the title and job  but not the salary and other benefits   picard later did promote wesley to a full ensign  making the appointment permanent  however  keep in mind that as uvwboyaf1 said  cadet ranks are separate from actual ranks you can be a noobfreshmanmaggot in basic  academy and still be an officer  enlisted in active service separate chains of command and all that  and it s assumed that people who got the sfa are pretty bright already and do nt need the basic intro there may be a little hazing for indoctrination  but probably nowhere as hard as modern human academies ,d01qgi7,startrek,television,1455614572.0,kschang,1.0,0.0,3500,9520,1.0

star trek is a tv franchise with film spinoffs your best option would be starting with tos or tng  http  wwwredditcomrstartrekwikiwhere_should_i_start i started watching trek last october with tos  and i d recommend starting from there if you can get past the 60s feel and slowpaced storytelling  it s the show that started it all then you can continue on with the films and shows in  the correct order  you see in the guide above  if it s too dated for you  start with tng the first two seasons are rough  but season 3 and on is great every trek series after tos takes about two seasons to find its footing  so give them a chance before giving up  here s a more detailed guide i d recommend also giving a read basically expands on what i just said  http  wwwredditcomrdaystrominstitutewikikraetosintrototrek,czyit4y,startrek,television,1455378515.0,Fruit_Pastilles,7.0,0.0,6417,16644,0.0

i have to agree with the others  the heart and soul of star trek is the various tv series  the movies are just a bonus the movies are mostly action focused and tend to revolve around evil villains who are up to no good and must be stopped  which is a poor reflection of what the franchise has to offer as a whole  the original series from the 60s is the true starting point  but it can be difficult for a modern viewer to get into the next generation is the gentlest entry point as it s not quite as dated  but be aware that its first two seasons are a bit sucky deep space nine is my personal favourite  and is generally well regarded by fans  but it s best watched after having seen tng voyager and enterprise have some good qualities  but probably are nt the best place to start ,czykak5,startrek,television,1455381294.0,TheGodBen,2.0,0.0,4476,11981,0.0

i have a bunch of them  listed from most controversial to least  roughly      ds9 is not the  best trek     while it s a good show that deserves a lot of the praise it gets  ds9 is unbalanced it goes too far into the dark and gritty tng s main problem is that it sometimes went too far into the politically correct tos is the most balanced trek  and that s why i think it s the best depiction of  trek values   frankly  i m tired of the ds9 veneration and the trashing of tos around here     tos is not  dated     if you bother to actually watch  the issues that the episodes address are just as relevant today as they were in 1966 whining about special effects when star trek was never about glitzy effects in the first place is missing the forest for the trees i can understand if tos is  just not your thing   but if you re truly that bothered by special effects that are nt perfect  i m sorry  you re a baby     picard s behavior in first contact is not out of character    depicting him as so singlemindedly determined to defend his ship and defeat the borg is perfectly consistent with a man who has excess baggage from being captured and forced to wage war against his own people     spock is not literally a descendant of sherlock holmes    a lot of trekkies seem to take that quote literally  but i ve always interpreted it to mean that as a man of logic  spock is something of a successordescendant to holmes  not that you can literally trace spock s family tree back to holmes ,d01bg8l,startrek,television,1455583613.0,Blue_Dog_Democracy,24.0,0.0,407,14347,0.0

1  pulaski was a _far_ more interesting and dynamic character than crusher i would even say that she was played by a better actress as well crusher was mostly window dressing for all intents and purposes and the episodes that did feature her as a central character tended to be pretty weak  2  star trek  the motion picture was a great trek film it has its issues but i would rather watch it five times in a row than watch _any_ of the tng films  3  voyager killed star trek s prime universe voyager was a show that lasted five more seasons than it deserved and to be honest  if it had been cancelled early  enterprise would have  assuming it even got made  been more successful because it would mean that berman would have rightly been pulled from his position in favor of someone who was not creatively burned out voyager was a bad show and while trek fans may be tolerant  the general tv audience clearly was not and rightfully so  4  seven of nine was not that interesting jeri ryan was a good actress and she did surprisingly well with the garbage she was handed but as a whole  she was really just put in the show to up the t and a factor as a boost for ratings they did not even try to hide that fact  when i look back on the show  seven  like most of the other characters  only had a few episodes where she was really able to do something interesting the rest of the time she was just repeating the same old borg lines over and over  5  ds9 s first two seasons were fantastic from the pilot on  the show did a great job setting up the world  the situation  and the characters those who found it too  slow    religious   or worse yet   boring  missed the point  6  skipping episodes if you have never seen them based on some internet list is stupid make your own choices  7  if the new trek show is based in the jjverse  that does not automatically make it bad there are good stories you can tell in that setting  8  we get it  enterprise had a bad theme song  get over it you would think that people would just skip it and move on with their lives without posting how much they hate it over and over again heck  i hate it to but i do nt feel the need to announce it  9  the novels tend to be nothing much more than glorified fanfiction these days and i am glad they are not canon as a result  10  star trek casting decisions and series ideas are best handled by seasoned industry professionals i know your post borgwar show with the enterprise f being crewed by the entire firefly cast seems like a great idea but it really is not ,d01glo6,startrek,television,1455591715.0,StarTrekMike,18.0,0.0,46,33953,1.0

mine is that i actually really love voyager i m not going to argue against how there are many terrible early episodes and how the kazon were honestly just a weak villain group and a nuisance  but once seven shows up  i really began to love it stuff was actually at stake  they had a real overarching plot like ds9  not just a couple connected episodes like tng w romulan and borg  arcs   and while janeway annoyed me in the beginning   especially with her damn bun  i really did love her in the end yes  they made the borg look weak sometimes  yes  they always had a predictable shuttle crash episode each season  but for some reason  i really grew to like it i liked the idea of having a ship that is truly going where no man has gone before  wo starfleet to back them up each time lt  insert crazy butthurt alien heregt  came knocking and seeing more of the borg w seven of nine was really cool  and the doctor was a really interesting character after he got the mobile emitter  even though he was somewhat a copy of data s character at the end of the day  i really like it  but i wo nt argue that voyager is certainly an acquired taste  and while tng will always have a place of course  voyager really can take the cake sometimes for me after all  janeway found coffee nebulae ,d01ga4r,startrek,television,1455591210.0,NovaHyperion3601,4.0,0.0,1,133,0.0

i do nt hate the film  but i will single out one issue i always had with it  killing off all of picard s blood relatives we know of simply to give him a temptation to stay in the nexus  sure  it was ron moore who created those characters to help picard in family  but their deaths fit a pattern established in the tos years of killing off most people kirk was close to who did nt wear a starfleet uniform  his edith keeler  his brother and his sisterinlaw  kirok s wife  and then his son  the movie after they meet because according to the writers  he had to be punished for using protomatter in genesis  cheating at playing god   carrying the trope over to tng like this annoyed me the more i thought about it  and if sisko s wife being killed in ds9 s pilot had nt been written to make good use of picard s crossover  i might be annoyed about that too ,czywna3,startrek,television,1455403118.0,I_Am_Rondon,9.0,0.0,1,80,0.0

it is  and still remains  the best tng movie  not even sure why people love first contact so much and then say generations plot is horrible  what annoys me the most is if the borg can travel back in time at will why not do it every episode or movie they are in  that s not even the biggest annoyance with the film  picard goes from being a respected  intelligent  peaceful diplomat to an 80s action movie protagonist hell bent on revenge without any regard for the safety of the ship or his crew you could argue that the borg violated him in the most intimate and personal way and his emotions overrode his rationality  i would agree if it were shortly after they recovered him in the series but i ca nt really remember which episode but later on in the series he realises that committing genocide would make him no better than the borg and he did this against the wishes of starfleet  he made peace with what happened to him and now all of a sudden he goes all rambo  so yeah fuck first contact generations is the best tng movie ,czzd2n2,startrek,television,1455434975.0,TheLegendOfMart,3.0,0.0,207,3603,0.0

i have very fond memories of watching generations at the movies my only failing with it  and with some of the other movies  is that it did nt feel like an epic movie it just felt like a long episode with better spfx and because it was a movie they felt like they had to destroy the enterprise  because that s what you do in movies   first contact felt epic i liked insurrection  but again it felt like a two part episode more than a movie   and nemesis i liked butfor some reason there s no rewatchability  god i could have sworn that was a real word ,d00hvya,startrek,television,1455528018.0,Dastari,1.0,0.0,1,14,0.0

although i agree with the answers you ve received  trek is really about the tv shows  and tng is probably the best place to start  just be warned that the first 2 seasons of tng are nt exactly great tv   i think it s worth actually answering the question in the title of your post  if you really want to start with the movies  watch the original series movies  ivi   i and v are not universally liked  but the rest are good  and will give you a reasonable idea of what star trek is about  sadly  the tng movies are not very good  the reboot movies are good action movies but do nt really represent star trek ,czym2xq,startrek,television,1455384412.0,sasquatch007,6.0,0.0,1,5235,0.0
the movies are based on characters and stories that were built up from the tv series i would actually recommend trying the next generation tv series  and go through the guides others have posted do nt be afraid to skip bad episodes in the first couple seasons i wrote a personalized opinion  here   https  wwwredditcomrstartrekcomments432vs3so_i_want_to_get_into_star_trek_but_have_no_ideaczfe3w1  context  3  a few weeks ago about which episodes were most important to watch in the first couple seasons i stand behind my assessment  if you really want to go with a film  just watch the first of the 2009 series do nt watch into darkness until much later  because it kind of ruins things that happened in one of the actual best films in the franchise if you enjoy the 2009 film  go back to the original series  watch the episode space seed  and any of the other good ones  there are lists all over the web of the best of tos   then start with star trek 2  the wrath of khan  and just finish that series off 5 is skippable  it s a pretty bad film altogether the motion picture is also skippable  it s not a great film either and it s really dense unless you re deep into the trek universe it s worth watching at some point  but it really is  bad 2001  a space odyssey ,czyl4sn,startrek,television,1455382768.0,Theopholus,2.0,0.0,51,15662,0.0

while i adore the enterpriserefit design and respect matt jefferies original designs  the upgrade of the enterprise in the reboot was needed as i got older and became more observant  i started to not like the design on the original and the refit     the slender neck    it s so thin that is seem like nothing practical can go there thus a waste of space it also seems like a huge tactical disadvantage since one torpedo could punch a whole through it or  as  wok  showed  a phaser blast can severely damage it the torsion on that section of the ship much be enormous     the bridge on top of the ship    both  ent  and  nemesis  showed that a bridge on top of the ship is a bad idea granted  the reboot has the bridge up top  but it does have some sort of deck space above it that sort of cushions it  though the windowviewer creates a new but smaller weak spot   i just want a design where the bridge is not exposed  like have it just one deck below the dome or make a  command deck  that houses the bridge  conference rooms  a other rooms and just have it either 1 deck below the dome or the bottom deck of the dome     the slenderness of the pylons    unless the are super armored  the pylons are a huge tactical disadvantage they are so slim  it seems like all you need is one good hit and you ll take out power to the nacelle and damage the ship from leaking plasma also  just like the neck  the forces exerted on them from the nacelles themselves must be atrocious while the reboot had bigger and bulkier nacelles  the pylons are a tad bit beefier     the overall size of the constitution class    when i was little  i thought the connie was bigger than it really was i can across the truth and the ship can off as very weak now i understand there wo nt be any supersized ships in the 23rd century when the federation is only about 100 years old however  it could have used a protein shake or two now that i m a little bit older  i understand that the use or repetitive corridors and long walking scenes are what gave me the impression that the ship was bigger still  it could have used either and upscale or a beef up think of the rebooted ship more around the size of the  ambassador  class  the only designs that i think are pretty practical that still have necks for the iconic star trek look are the  excelsior  class and the  ambassador  class  why not the  galaxy  class if you like the  ambassador   my issues with the  galaxy  class are for another day   but like i said before  i salute the  tos  design and adore the refit they just needed beefing up in my opinion ,d02krul,startrek,television,1455668169.0,eRock9202,1.0,0.0,1,146,0.0

i keep on saying this but this show is really good so far i really love how this show takes an idea and just takes it everywhere it can go it really appeals to me and i am really enjoying watching the next thing that they explore i feel like i have a lot to say this time around so let s get to it   redemption  part ii not really as good as part 1 but some solid battles and data got time to shine pretty cool   darmok very good it finally helped me understand the universal translator and it was a really solid view at language and culture exchange that kept an interesting core to avoid being dull   ensign ro i know the bajorans become important later and this was quite a good intro i had a hard time following the actual plot but ro was nice and it was saved by her character   silicon avatar the plot took a long journey before discovering what it was but what it was  was pretty damn good the story of revenge and the federation neglecting someone like that was very interesting and the ending was bold   disaster great character episode some cool and unusual pairings and great dialogue plot was ok too  i guess   the game while i did nt particularly desire to see wesley again this episode was nice and creepy but i ca nt say it s a new favourite of mine  either   unification very nice i liked seeing spock and the plot kept itself engaging throughout got slightly weaker when sela showed up but overall it was very well done and picard had a lot of great moments   a matter of honor i mean perspective i mean time certainly watchable but him being a conman was a bit obvious i liked some interactions between rasmussen and the crew but overall it was rather dull the actual problemsolving and picard s dilemma was really solid though   new ground not being a member of the fandom i do nt know what people think of alexander i think i quite like him the actor is really bad  but i like the way he acts as a foil for worf and he certainly brings something new to the show now the episode itself was pretty standard and only really got good during the ending   hero worship this was a fun episode  if a bit low on substance the child actor was  again  not that great but the episode was just a nice bit of fluff and there was some nice data scenes in there   violations well this episode was weird little actual plot and it was about rape overall i was nt that engaged but i did nt hate it either   the masterpiece society terribly dull it was way too much like a tos episode and troi romances seem to be doomed to be boring and unbelievably dumb but i did like the morality discussions quite a bit and that part was quite nice   conundrum really solid i liked the concept and the characters are explored from a whole new angle ro and riker have surprisingly good chemistry and the mystery aspect was well executed   power play the actors probably had a field day with this one and the possesed people did a bangup job of playing hose roles as for the actual plot i found the enterprise caper a lot more engaging than the old ship stuff and the ending did nt give me much but i ca nt say i dislike it   ethics great drama  if a bit soapy worf was very much in character but the real interesting stuff was between crusher and ellen degeneres  android clone ellenbot 3000 really did show the varied nature of people within the federation and she provided a different viewpoint in a believable way i mean you know they wo nt kill off worf but it was pretty nice to see him walking at the end   the outcast really good even if it does play it pretty safe in some areas the concept is interesting and wellexplored and the ending is wonderfully horrible  reminiscent of the city on the edge of forever i really liked soren s character and her and riker had a very genuine chemistry  maybe jonathan frakes just has chemistry with everyone   cause and effect loved it the looping was really well directed and executed and the plot got the concept across  while still moving forward and the characters got a chance to figure out a mystery   the first duty we are not allowed to forget wesley apparently but again  solid episode and putting a former main character in this morally wrong position and having picard absolutely fuming was a very bold choice and it gives some interesting insight into starfleet everyday   cost of living uhhhhhhh i did not need an alexandermama troi episode in my life i did nt get the holodeck scenes  alexander is kind of a twat and i was just not engaged surprisingly my favourite thing about it was lwaxana s relationship with her husbandtobe and the stuff around that   the perfect mate i feel really bad the episode is almost too good at presenting the metamorph character and the ending made me feel like shit the scenes with kamala and picard were fantastic  but i ca nt say i cared much for her scenes of seducing various men but as a concept episode it was pretty great what  there were ferengi in this episode  huh   imaginary friend more fucking children please stop doing this forever tng i was constantly groaning during this episode it mixes horrible child acting  the cassandra truth clich   a particular pet peeve of mine   and a moral issue that really did not need to be explored why did they make this   i borg absolutely fantastic it develops the borg in a great way and the various characters  response to everything was great prejudice  individuality and lot of interesting points are explored and hugh was great to see develop geordi got a chance to shine and the ending was kind of sad  but still ambiguous enough to be slightly hopeful   the next phase really liked it  the mystery was cool and the concept was well explored and the funeral planning and data stuff was just sweet as hell and i m really starting to love ro   the inner light  aka the one were picard becomes jorel  well that out of the way this one is popular and i mean i liked it it was great as an exploration of life and picard got some really good stuff i wanted to see the episode develop and the ending was absolutely great i can see why people have a fondness for it   time s arrow  part i love it data is wonderful as a french inventor and i am really excited to see where it goes i did nt care much for the alien stuff but people s reaction to the data death stuff was very nice looking forward to part 2   now keep in mind this is a long list and i might misremember some episodes  or give them a weird rating it s also like 330 am as i write this i also might have been a bit to favourable this time aorund

in  alliances   during the scene when all the kazon leaders enter the room for their big meeting  there are sound effects of somewhat silly ceremonial horns and an audience whistling and clapping as each one enters  i would be willing to say the horns are just part of the background music  or perhaps being provided by some kazon bugle boy off screen  but the clapping  there is nobody else in the room other than the voyager crew members the voyager members are seen during the moments we hear the clapping and they are clearly shown to not be the source of it  is the clapping supposed to be some prerecorded stock footage sound effect the kazon leaders play over hidden speakers whenever they enter a room together  just kind of seemed odd to me  made me feel like i was watching a sitcom for a minute ,45wh77,startrek,television,1455543300.0,sabrefudge,43.0,0.0,38763,89492,1.0

forgive my lack of actual military knowledge  that is why i am asking the group this question  so wesley crusher is given a field commission to the rank of an ensign he is subsequently seen wearing an official uniform and pips on his collar is this common  and what happens to this rank when he later goes to starfleet academy as a cadet  it seems a bit unfair to those fellow cadets who start in wesley s cadet class who may have never served on a starship  when wesley has been serving for years as an acting ensign and now an actual ensign also does wesley have to attend the entry level classes explaining the very basics of star fleet  so many questions ,45zmcp,startrek,television,1455580705.0,davect01,3.0,0.0,1263,9550,0.0
one of my favorite experiences at the military academy i attended was when i was just a newb  and one my fellow newbies had prior enlisted experience on active duty  he was a marine corporal  but at school  he was just a newb like us  one day  the upper classmen were in a particularly foul mood  and laying it on my buddy a little too thick my buddy understandably got pissed  disappeared into his dorm room  and reappeared in his marine uniform he then proceeded to announce his intention to  end  some of the upper classmen if they did nt  calm their tits  after that  he put his cadet uniform back on  and acted as though nothing had happened  i hope this answers your question ,d01fdnj,startrek,television,1455589794.0,vwboyaf1,6.0,0.0,5968,17602,0.0

the idea of someone getting a field commission is probably not unheard of  though it s likely more common in situations like voyager  or after a major battle in the dominion war also probably not with 1415 year olds  when he went to the academy the rank went away it would have looked good on his resume and probably fast tracked him for promotion if he d graduated the academy  as opposed to running off with the traveler  but it would have meant very little at the academy directly  as to fairness to other cadets  it s probably no different than someone who d done high school internships in their field of study going to college today you ve got a bit more knowledge  but as long as you do nt treat your fellow students like you re better than them  which i ca nt really see wesley doing  they likely would nt consider it a bad thing  and he probably would have been a popular studybuddy  and he probably would have been able to get out of the truly introductory level classes  but i doubt it was automatic  he d likely have to take a challenge exam to do so ,d01bygi,startrek,television,1455584437.0,feor1300,2.0,0.0,1090,130544,0.0
field promotions are usually done for filling in officer positions for a unit that lots several officers  entd does nt need another ensign  and remember  wesley s rank is actually  according to picard   acting ensign   acting whatever basically is  you get the title and job  but not the salary and other benefits   picard later did promote wesley to a full ensign  making the appointment permanent  however  keep in mind that as uvwboyaf1 said  cadet ranks are separate from actual ranks you can be a noobfreshmanmaggot in basic  academy and still be an officer  enlisted in active service separate chains of command and all that  and it s assumed that people who got the sfa are pretty bright already and do nt need the basic intro there may be a little hazing for indoctrination  but probably nowhere as hard as modern human academies ,d01qgi7,startrek,television,1455614572.0,kschang,1.0,0.0,3500,9520,1.0

weird part is that  given the synopsis  trek v actually had a lot of potential   an attempt at a peaceful multigovernmental world that basically became a bureaucratic backwater   armed terrorists taking over the enterprise  and the crew having to try to take it back deck by deck   a political triangle with the klingons  the romulans  and the federation   spock s long lost brother  on a fanatical religious mission  letting no one get in his way   having to crash land a shuttle into the shuttle bay while under threat of a bird of prey  all of these elements sound so cool on paper  but were executed so poorly in the movie ,czz5wr9,startrek,television,1455419539.0,theDashRendar,19.0,0.0,9880,84118,1.0

yes that scene with mccoy and his father is one of the most poignant and powerful scenes in all of trek  and for characterization  i d say the way spock is portrayed in v is the most like his tos self than any of the other movies  much to dislike in this film  but i can still appreciate its quality moments ,czzfso1,startrek,television,1455445490.0,gfreeman1998,5.0,0.0,27,441,0.0
this film is actually one of my favourites because of the characterisation of everyone  not only did it make good use of the diverse chemistry between kirk  spock and mccoy  it also was the film that had some scenes where the rest of the crew interacted that made me realize for the first time that i did nt know enough about them and _their_ relationships towards each other and that i wanted to see more of it that movie changed the rest of the crew from  they are importand characters but not the main characters  to  they are people with lives and identities and friendships too  add that to the movie theme of life and death  family and friends  comfort and conflict  yes it had it s issues  but i ve never understood why it is getting so much dislike ,czzikuw,startrek,television,1455456547.0,yamina-chan,6.0,0.0,827,1317,0.0

k  i just finished ds9 it was amazing but you already know that  my question is about stuff happening simultaneously like  presumably gen takes place during ds9  right  because it s after tng ends so what s going on aboard ds9 while picard is trying to stop soaryn  i know that in fc  we see worf commanding the defiant  a nod to ds9 but when did i see worf get called away from the station to fight the borg at earth  like  the borg are scarcely mentioned in ds9 if the borg were literally attacking earth  there d be some mention of it on ds9 sisko would probably get called away to command a ship  probably the defiant tbh  stuff like this bugs me i try to dismiss this stuff and accept that these filmsshows are all made by different groups of people who do nt necessarily sit down and iron out continuity issues but it always kinda nags at me that there are so many times when things do nt quite jive  then there s the ferengi boy  they changed in ds9 it almost feels like ds9 is nt even star trek sometimes it s amazing  entertaining  wellacted  wellwritten and a generally great show but it does nt feel like it fits in alongside tos or tng but about the ferengi  in tng  they re portrayed as pirates  thieves  and so on the first contact with them was about stolen equipment and the ferengi in that episode had those cool electricity whips why did i never see those again  there were tons of ferengi in ds9 they were nt pirates or thieves  though they were traders and swindlers they never seemed to use weapons  except that psychopath that quark brought to save his mom from iggy pop   that s so different than the tng ferengi that would commandeer the enterprise a ds9 ferengi would trick you into legit selling him your ship for peanuts a tng ferengi would hijack your ship with force see the difference  again  i know there s a lot of creative reasons why these things happened different teams  different producers  different writers and directors i get it it s just weird how different ds9 feels than anything else  i ve just started voyager now i m 5 episodes in and i like it  but it definitely feels more like tng  and that s another thing  voyager disappears while pursuing maquis  presumably somewhere near ds9  why is there no mention of this in ds9  i know in the first ep of voyager  they depart from ds9 and quark is there but you d think there would be a ds9 episode where they mention something about voyager leaving to pursue maquis  all in all  i love each st entity i ve seen  even the films that everyone says are terrible but it does bug me to see stuff like this these things are taking place in the same universe  why ca nt they be a bit more tied together  unless they are and i just missed the explanations for this stuff  which is totally possible ,45yz06,startrek,television,1455573200.0,Ramza_Claus,0.0,0.0,15760,127356,0.0
generations takes place a couple years into ds9 it s before worf shows up  so there s no real question of how he got to the enterprise  and you did nt see worf get called away you did nt see every event of every day on ds9 it s something you just did nt see timing of lining up shared universe movies with tv shows like what marvel does did nt really happen back then it would have been unreasonable to expect that of ds9  as for the ferengi  yes  ds9 changed them a lot did they change them more than tng changed klingons i d argue no they changed the appearance of klingons they changed the general attitude of klingons in tos we do nt see the klingons with hand based weapons  but in all other shows it s made known that is how the klingons prefer to fight  yeah  there s some continuity stuff among aliens it happens across a lot of series it does nt really happen too badly in voyager  but they mostly created their own aliens also  i personally think ent was really great about that but ds9 and tng both made changes in aliens ,d015rq7,startrek,television,1455574653.0,DnMarshall,1.0,0.0,62,57414,1.0

it does do pretty well when compared to  most  other trek games  it certainly got the basic trek idea down far better than titles like elite force 12  armada  and even stuff like bridge commander  which had the best ship combat but literally nothing else going for it   if there is one thing i am not fond of about a final unity   even when i first played it as a kid   it is that the puzzles were too puzzle like  i always felt like it had some great moments but a lot of the game felt like a fairly generic  and somewhat untrek like  adventure title with a trek coat of paint ,czx2bea,startrek,television,1455259857.0,StarTrekMike,2.0,0.0,46,33953,1.0

the plots to ds9 and voyager do nt cross at all they take place in entirely different parts of the galaxy  personally  i would nt recommend watching them simultaneously ds9 was one of the shows that would set the template for the golden age of television the character development and serialization are fantastic i prefer to get immersed in series like that voyager would only suck you out of it  so  i d vote for separately but that s just how i like to watch shows ,czymy22,startrek,television,1455385884.0,DnMarshall,16.0,0.0,62,57414,1.0

there is no downside beside the shift in quality and style  but i did nt find that to be a problem either when it was initially broadcast or on a recent chronological rewatch there is a small amount of overlap  and voyager s pilot episode involves it being at ds9   but it s fairly minor background elements that wo nt make much of a difference  i prefer the broadcast order because i like those extra bits and you get the same context the production team expected  though you ca nt  really  go wrong with either approach ,czyst7e,startrek,television,1455396219.0,Dantonn,1.0,0.0,2419,80021,0.0

i ve been going through the entire franchise in broadcast order  just finished ent yesterday   and i actually quite liked breaking them up for one thing  voy has a very rough patch later in s2 into s3  and its a slog to get through  but there are some strong ds9 episodes around then  so you always have something to look forward to moreover  ds9  while it engages with serialization  is nt quite as tight as its reputation  and because of budget issues  big stuff happens at the beginning and end of seasons  and then there s a lot of sitting around with characters worrying about how things are going to fall out that all feels more reasonable if you re not watching one right after the other  there are also a couple very minor crossovers they wo nt be a big deal if you miss them  but they re kind of neat ,czyz7jn,startrek,television,1455407657.0,Cliffy73,1.0,0.0,10,14004,0.0

the timelines are always affected in the same way  whether there is a loop or an alternate universe what is shown to the audience is simply a matter of perspective so yes  in the  prime  universe the enterprisec goes back to their own timeline and creates the loop that we accept in the canon  prime  timeline  but there is also an alternate universe where they do not return to their time it simply is nt shown to the audience because the loop is what defines the  prime  timeline  as uhmsbountya said  it s up to the writers  but i think that the distinction between different forms of time travel is moot when you look at the big picture that does nt mean this is nt an interesting  wellresearched article  just that there are a lot of semantics involved when the reality is that every possible timeline is occurring and not occurring simultaneously and the only people who define what is and is not part of the  prime  timeline are the writers  which is a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise interesting thought experiment ,czxk856,startrek,television,1455300936.0,mexicalien,3.0,0.0,1,23,0.0

ds9 is the best star trek series because it s unparalleled in terms of character development  speciescultural development and complex story arcs  with that said  it sounds like you just started watching ds9 and most people will agree that season 1 amp  2 are the weakest seasons many of the episodes were still very tnglike it was nt until season 3 or 4  depend on who you ask  does ds9 truly take off  however  if you have already decided that you re going to dislike ds9 because the premise does nt fit your expectation  then there is nt much anyone can say will change your mind ,czzum93,startrek,television,1455479657.0,Luomulanren,16.0,0.0,61,7210,0.0

gt  star trek is about a crew of life forms exploring the universe in a super cool starship star trek is different things to different people  no definition is true for everyone  but what i can say is that star trek is a universe filled with interesting characters and species  and no series does a better job of exploring those facets than ds9 the other series are about exploring the galaxy  but ds9 is about exploring  star trek itself   if you continue with ds9  you ll learn more about the complex and nuanced individuals that inhabit the star trek universe you ll learn more about the different societies and how they relate to one another and you ll find the idealistic morality of star trek challenged in interesting ways  if you can let go of your narrow interpretation of what star trek is and adopt a broader view of the universe then you ll find a lot to love in deep space nine and if not  well  you ll always have the other series to enjoy ,d0095en,startrek,television,1455505566.0,TheGodBen,3.0,0.0,4476,11981,0.0
i agree there are some boring ds9 episodes  however the series gives the appearance of being well thought out long in advance things that happen that seem inconsequential in the earlier seasons come back as  ahhhh huh   moments later on which makes the whole thing glue together well  there s also several good underlying story arcs that expand a lot more on things we only got a small taste of in tng  yes including the klingons which i generally find boring but hey  the dominion war is good it feels very like much like the borg threat an enemy which really feels like it could threaten earth keeps it entertaining and not all rainbows and puppy dogs  good character interaction  eventually   different story lines than you see on series set on a star ship  though when they get the defiant all the old star ship style stories start reappearing   all in all my favourite star trek series ,d00hpbe,startrek,television,1455527279.0,Dastari,3.0,0.0,1,14,0.0
ds9 is a series that you have to go into with a certain mindset  a understanding that it is _not_ going to be a typical trek experience that one may be used to  tng  tos  voyager  etc   when it first came out  ds9 got _a lot_ crap for not only being based on a station   they are not exploring     but also because they took a more philosophicalspiritual route  this approach was essential to set the stage for the exploration of the bajoran culture and how their spiritual foundations clash with the federationstarfleet officers posted on the station  confining the crew to a station was a good move  it allowed the writers to focus on developing the main and secondary characters since they were always going to be the primary focus of all the stories when you look at shows like tng  tos  and _especially voyager  you see that the character development is often put behind the plot of the week  this was not the case with ds9 where the characters _were_ the core part of the plot  now  there is one part of your post that i think you should probably really think about  gt  star trek is about a crew of life forms exploring the universe in a super cool starship but ds9 removed all the ships this was a very common complaint when ds9 first aired  a lot of established tos and tng fans were upset because they thought it turned its back on what trek actually was the truth of the matter is that ds9 is just as loyal to the star trek formula as every other series it is still about the human adventure  about us finding ways to make ourselves better  more understanding  and more thoughtful it is still about humanity s journey into the stars but instead of quickly exploring a new race every week  we instead see sisko and crew exploring a few cultures in deep and meaningful ways  along the way  we as a audience get to explore the inner workings of federationstarfleet politics on a level that we could _never_ really get with a ship out on the fringes of the frontier we got to really understand how the federation and humanity in particular deal with a culture that is deeply entrenched in its religion  to put it another way  deep space nine is what happens when you let _good_ writers  _good_ actors  and a really solid production team do what they do best it is a show that is not afraid to dig deeper  try new things  and push against the status quo in interesting and meaningful ways  ds9 s first two seasons may not be full of phaser fire  deep space exploration  or even new aliens every episode but they do carefully construct a setting that feels tangible and characters that actually progress and grow in both the acting and the writing it is easily the most consistent star trek show in terms of overall quality  if you go into ds9 with the mindset of  where are the ships     it is not star trek without ships   or  why so much talking     then you are not going to like it  it is a slower  and not in a bad way   more nuanced trek that is not afraid to really tell a well developed and interesting story  to be blunt  it sounds like you are approaching ds9 with the expectation that it _must_ be more like tng  tos  or even voyager that it needs to be entirely based on a ship in order to be  true  star trek if you can let go of that misplaced expectation  i think you will be on the road to understanding why ds9 is such a loved series and is probably the best written one in trek history thus far ,d00z191,startrek,television,1455564852.0,StarTrekMike,1.0,0.0,46,33953,1.0
