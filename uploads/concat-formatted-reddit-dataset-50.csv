gt  the series was a huge sensation despite the fact that nothing beyond the first season aired on american television until later the pause was due primarily to censorship issues  cartoons were seen purely as a children  s medium whose audience  according to american broadcasters  could not comprehend advanced concepts such as death or deal with excessive onscreen violence tezuka was personally approached and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this changed even a bit in the last  half a century  we see the same shit even today  and this is too short  i want more  ca nt wait for the next part  we will get into a more familiar territory for us and hopefully we can pick up a show or two from that period ,anime,entertainment,1455634221.0,11.0,0.0,24966.0,114769.0,0.0

if you read a lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things  check out this anime you ll like what you find  i m martinthedragon  and i thank you for reading ,anime,entertainment,1455658733.0,117.0,0.0,1026.0,699.0,0.0

he wrote the script himself  i m wary of anything todd mcfarlane writes after his interview with the comics journal  mcfarlane  yeah  i  m  uh  i just don  t  i  you got me pinned in the corner here  because i don  t read  and you  re right  it is kind of funny that i  m a writer you know what i mean  groth  yeah  mcfarlane  more than that  though  it  s kind of frustrating to writers out there  groth  or irksome  mcfarlane  because  then  either it doesn  t really fucking matter what people write  then  because if i can do it  and i can sell 1000000 copies with bad writing  then what the fuck is the problem  that brings us to the argument  then  that maybe the artwork is more important  that  s a whole  nother discussion then  at that point  groth  or maybe most comicbook readers don  t care about the writing  mcfarlane  then i  m going   ok  they don  t care about the writing  perfect then  it  s a good thing that i  m a better artist than writer right now  then  i mean  the fates are looking down on me even when i don  t try  i seem to somehow succeed i  m ignorant on a lot of things  but i think that i  m somewhat wellbalanced in life  such that i  ve been thrown into a kind of a fame and fortune  i  m a fuck  let me tell you about it  but you know what  the kids never see that side of me when i  m in front of the kids  because they  re the most important thing to me  i  m a pussycat i owe my life to every single one of those kids that buys my book i don  t care if they  re 8 or 28  or 88 it  s the readers that i owe everything to i don  t give a shit about the fucking other people that are along the chain they exist because  ultimately  because of those kids the distributors can think that they  re doing something that  s grand and whatever else  and they are  but they wouldn  t even exist if people didn  t want comic books the retailers are doing a great job and i love them but they wouldn  t be selling comic books if the kid didn  t want to buy comic books now  somewhere down the line those kids are buying the comic books  so when they react to my stuff  and i read my mail  if i make any changes  it  s from the fan mail   i think  todd  that this character  s a little bit too dark and morose for us  i think he  s too happy  i think he  s too fat  i think he  s too wide   i react to those kids  because they  re my buying public editorial people  or anybody else along the way says   todd  don  t make them fat   why   just because  that  s not a good enough answer to me right now in my life the kids  unfortunately  when they  re sitting there going   he  s too fat  because he looks like a little lump of    they  ve actually got a reason why they think he  s too fat nobody else along the chain has it  so  i  ve been thrust in a position where i can either be a fuck or an ignoramus i can play any game that anybody wants me to play i think that i can play them  somewhat  with whatever skill that i have i should have been an actor i think i perform very well but i also know that i  m not good at everything that i do i  m better at other things but i don  t think that  just because i  m not good at somethings  that i  m not good at being a writer  that i should have a better writer on my book  groth  but if you respect writing  and you respect your audience  wouldn  t you try to make yourself a better writer  mcfarlane  uhhuh  groth  but you don  t read anything  mcfarlane  no  i don  t read anything  groth  so how can you make yourself a better writer if you don  t study writing and read other authors  mcfarlane  maybe there  s my ignorance there  because i don  t think that if i read shakespeare i  m going to become a good comicbook writer  groth  well  i don  t either  resigned   mcfarlane  i don  t know what you want me to read i mean  if it  s technical stuff  you  re going to have a tough time  because unless it  s got pictures  i can  t read black and white  other than the box scores i just don  t have that mentality i  ve got to have pictures in front of me i don  t read comics  i don  t read nothing really i read the sports page  and then the comics journal  i  m going to give you a plug actually  that  s black and white i do read that and whatever else it  s not like i don  t have somewhat of a mild vocabulary out there ,comicbooks,entertainment,1455556499.0,11.0,0.0,46.0,9931.0,0.0

i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455581228.0,6.0,0.0,123.0,4165.0,0.0

all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455560441.0,4.0,0.0,50.0,34365.0,0.0

1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had become toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559577.0,2.0,0.0,5956.0,33693.0,1.0

yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  welcome to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455554443.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,27.0,0.0

it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister ,harrypotter,entertainment,1455568927.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,20037.0,0.0

i m an older dude and a huge genesis fan so i ll give it a shot this is why i do nt like phil collins  phil was the drummer in one of the seventies greatest prog rock bands around respect for that peter gabriel left and phil replaced him on lead vocals after a massive search for a new lead singer that turned up nobody that interested the band  the great music continued with phil on lead vocals in the late seventiesearly eighties really brilliant stuff gabriel was not missed a few albums into the phil led genesis they had a hit song  follow you  follow me   this was the beginning of the end  but not quite yet  then duke great album  but much more commercial that s cool still a great album and the band is growing  abacab fucking hell  this album is fucking amazing the greatest album genesis has ever released imo commercial  a bit  yes does nt matter brilliant stuff  here s where things start going wrong self titled genesis is next mama dark  beautiful and haunting a huge hit home by the sea the hit that was nt for some reason illegal alien pop garbage and utter shit but mtv blew it up the brilliance that was genesis was about to become a pop band money  girls  fame  whatever it was enticing for the band  they would not release another  good  song after genesis side one with home by the sea the rest was commercial bullshit this is exactly where i personally gave up on them as a band and stopped listening and buying their albums  phil goes solo the allure of fame is too much for him it s all radio friendly pap feel it in the air is undoubtedly a great song  but it was supposed to be a genesis song  and should have been phil collins blows up as a radio friendly pop superstar his musical integrity is fucking gone it s one shitty pop song after another absolutely nothing of substance  then he s doing disney soundtracks let me say that again he s doing disney fucking soundtracks  the drummer  later lead singer of one of the greatest progressive british bands of all time has sold his soul and musical integrity to disney for a paycheck  that s actually the last thing i ve heard  or cared  that phil collins has done he s musically irredeemable in my eyes he is the epitome of a sell out i have lost a lot of respect for him over the years ,music,entertainment,1455682527.0,2.0,0.0,42042.0,169593.0,1.0

yeah  that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke  and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh  i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides  are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen ,starwars,entertainment,1455654296.0,13.0,0.0,671.0,20964.0,0.0
not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep 8 or even 9  where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training  but when she completes her own saber  it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle involving rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors ,starwars,entertainment,1455640261.0,50.0,0.0,1.0,4317.0,0.0

it really is nt a feature i miss  but a gameplay aspect i m starting to notice  i miss how gym leaders could use a different number of pok  mon ever since black and white came out  the first two gym leaders use 2 pok  mon while the rest of them use 3 the other regions had some variety  in kanto for example  brock and misty use 2  lt surge uses 3 or 1 depending on the version  erika  sabrina  and blaine use 3  koga uses 4  and giovanni uses 5   elite four using 4 pok  mon is also something i do nt like i know oras is nt guilty of this but i think z will  i also miss the level variations the gym leaders  elite four  champion  and other bosses had i m sure many have noticed how the lead pok  mon is at the same level as every other pok  mon that the boss uses except for the ace  the lead pok  mon is always 2 levels less than the ace   it s just making the games a bit more predictable ,pokemon,gaming,1455682211.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,1909.0,0.0

i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,pokemon,gaming,1455680278.0,5.0,0.0,13.0,1669.0,0.0
so the one thing that s stopped me from going all the way with completing a national pokedex is that when a new generation is released  it s back to square one  sure you can use pokemon bank to transfers mons across  but this is time consuming and in order to maintain a complete dex you ll still need to be in possession of every evolution stage  what do you guys think about having the option to transfer pokedex completion to the next game  what would be some possible implications  restrictions etc to make it fair  do you think it s a bad idea in general  if so why ,pokemon,gaming,1455679785.0,2.0,0.0,103.0,2599.0,0.0

a lot of the time we remove posts from this subreddit  we the mods are often met with various behaviors that normal people would find unacceptable  despite our rules being clearly labeled on our side bar so instead  i m making this post to clarify a couple things and highlight our rules  which are as follows  1   please read the  skyrim faq   https  wwwredditcomrskyrimwikiindex  before you post    this is a good way to start the faq outlines several commonly asked questions and also highlights certain threads that contain good information  such as  what mods should i get   and system info  among other things  2   slurs and personal attacks will be met with an immediate ban    anything that can be construed as a personal attack or slur  even in jest  is not allowed in skyrim  in the last hour  i ve banned 10 people   http  iimgurcomvoxjgoepng  for varying degrees of personal attacks  and it s easy for me  because all i have to do it press a button and then read someone telling me to go fuck myself we have 4 pages of bans  and i do nt mind adding to it  so behave yourselves and if you see someone telling someone else to kill themselves or something similar  report it  3   mods reserve the right to remove posts and ban users at their discretion    see rule 2  4   no memes  no rage comics  no unrelated material    the first two are self explanatory instead  i will be explaining what constitutes unrelated material   pictures of real life that remind you of skyrim   hand prints   anything that is nt a screenshot of skyrim  art someone made of skyrim  or direct cosplay  including crafts  from skyrim   sweetrolls   screenshots or images with memelike text or captions   piracy  where to pirate the game  etc   begging for someone to gift you the game go fuck off   etc   on the topic of reposts    get over it there are 316379 subscribed users on rskyrim  and if rpics  user count of 9942242 subscribers is any indication of how many people are registered on this site  that means that only 318  of all of reddit normally sees posts on rskyrim  and i highly doubt that all 316379 of you see every single post made here  if anyone has questions or wants to get banned  please say so ,skyrim,gaming,1448051903.0,230.0,0.0,3002.0,26049.0,0.0

besides pyro  the only class i consider to be lacking in performance is heavy  who has a number of problems without a medic or a sandwich  heavy has problems performing his job as an offensivedefensive tank the whole point of heavy is to be the center of attention and absorb lots of damage while your team attacksdoes their jobs if your team does nt have a medic  you re screwed 300 is still a lot of hp  but it does nt go very far if you do nt have a medic healing you i think it would be a good idea to give heavy a  20  damage resistance while spun up  on all of his miniguns  or at least everyone of them except the tomislav  which could have a new stat  like extra movement speed or something the natascha and brass beast already have those  but stock is usually superior to both it would give heavy a better edge in fights  and i think it would be very good for him to have some sort of natural damage resistance i also think he could have a small hp regen while spun up and crouching  since he s basically a sitting duck while spun up and crouching  literally  and it could give him some more survivability spies and snipers would still screw you over  but i think it would be fair i would also like it if they brought his minigun back to it s old state  without the weird drop in accuracydamage for the 1st second of revup  and restore it s accuracy however  to balance it out  his minigun takes slightly longer to rev  about one second   it might need another change to keep it balanced  but i ll leave that up to your discussion ,tf2,gaming,1455670915.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,-9.0,0.0

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community

it should be noted that i ve upvoted every single person who s disagreed with me here  as far as i know  that said  in 7th grade  i took an sat test without preparing for it at all  it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ,circlejerk,humor,1455642176.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,864.0,0.0

you may be interested in  this similar question   https  wwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments3s6k0iposts_from_tankies_on_communist_subs_and_similar  about the use of marxian theory in history that i answered previously i do nt talk about historical materialism specifically  but marxian theory more generally  in terms of historical materialism specifically  i d say archaeologists have probably been some of the most enthusiastic adopters this makes sense to a degree since the study of archaeology is the study of material culture  and so the thesis of historical materialism is already in the wheelhouse of archaelogy one of the easiest things for archaeologists to determine from archaeological data is information about the relations of production in a society  and so historical materialism is attractive because it then proposes a way to use this easily generate data  on production  to talk about issues that are harder to discuss using archaeological data social organization for instance  v gordon childe  an avowed marxist in his political life  outside his research   has probably one of the more famous uses in his  neolithic revolution  model in this model  the development of craft specialists  aided by a transition to agricultural society  is one of the primary driving factors in the development of early states since he elaborated on this model in the 1930s and 40s archaeological research has indicated the origins of the state are much more complex than his fairly simple economic model  but that model still stands as an important component of the bigger picture even if it does nt tell the whole story ,askhistorians,learning,1455653921.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4064.0,0.0

the text you have in mind is john 19  2324 here s my translation  then the soldiers  when they crucified jesus  took his garments and made four portions  a share for each soldier  and the tunic now the tunic was seamless  woven from the top as a whole 24 then they said to one another   let  s not tear it  but cast lots concerning whose it will be   so that the writing might be fulfilled  which says    they divided my clothing among them  and they threw a lot for my garment  so the soldiers did these things  so  there are a few things to recognise first the garment in question was a kind of tunic that was worn under an outer cloak josephus in antiquities 3161 records the same concerning the high priest  s robe ancient commentators frequently found spiritual significance in the seamless nature of the robe  but that does not appear to be john  s point  which is instead centred on the dualfulfilment of how he understands the quotation from psalm 22  18 theodore of mopsuestia provides a helpful comment in that he notes that such methods of weaving were common in the time of christ so  in answer to your first question  a seamless garment was not out of their technological reach  and would have been possible john  s point seems to centre on  rather  that  a  the clothes were divided  and the tunic was leftover  so that  b  they could  also  gamble for the clothing  thus fulfilling both clauses in the psalm quotation  the tiein to the highpriest does not appear to be john  s point  nor does  seamless garments  have much other resonance in judaism  certainly not as a common  virginbirth trope  ,askhistorians,learning,1455676187.0,6.0,0.0,27.0,16414.0,1.0

the standard europe 101 argument  and i just gave a lecture on it last week  is   by building a state bureaucracy of nonnoble  paid staff  instead of offices that would be handed to aristocrats   by having loyal administrators   intendants   travel to distant areas and keep an eye on things   and by building versailles a huge symbol of status and power and then inviting the most powerful nobles in the realm to come live there  and distribute  favors   such as the opportunity to dress him in the morning  which translated into access  but a cooler  much more sophisticated argumenttoo complex for my 101 class  unfortunately is in william beik s book on absolutism  which basically shows how it s just as much a  bottom up  process namely  all the aforementioned things  bureaucratic statebuilding  versailles  were going on  of course   but the key factor became when the great nobles  anjou  berry  etc  started to perceive this growing  state  of louis xiv s monarchy as an  opportunity  as an avenue to advance their own interests  so  imagine the duc de berry in competition with the duc danjou  instead of a futile  and often deadlocked  direct struggle of rallying their own supporters  resources  etc  the could now turn to the growing stateand use it to press their own claims to their own advantage  short version  once the great nobles saw that they could  use  louis xiv for their own interests  they increasingly made louis the defacto  center  of power and thereafter could be increasingly coopted  by  him ,askhistorians,learning,1455662947.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,5631.0,0.0

the text here is luke 23  1325  for those playing at home  firstly  yes   barabbas  does translate to  son of the father   unlike your link  it  s not really correct to call this an honorific it is true that joshua would have been a common name it is also true that indicating which person you meant would be accomplished by adding something to a name  usually a patronymic  david  s joseph   or other distinguishing feature  samuel  from bethesda   etc  luke derives his narrative  most probably  from mark 15  815  but with some expansion there  s obviously debate about whether there was  in fact  a customlawhabit of releasing a prisoner for passover it is not impossible  but it is not well supported  technically  within the construct of the narrative  the fact htat pilate finds jesus innocent  this should lead to jesus  release pilate appears in the narrative to be trying to find a way to appease the jerusalem jews and still release jesus suggestions that  a roman governor would never do this  flatten out the picture of pilate  s governorship in judea  which contains both incidents of pilate riding absolutely roughshod over local concerns  and other incidents where pilate is more circumspect precisely because having judea revolt is not his aim  was pilate trying to perform a baitandswitch  i don  t think so it  s true that some manuscripts name barabbas as  jesus barabbas   but in my view this is a later addition which is trying to bring out something else that luke  s text is attempting to do  which is provide a narrative theologising of barabbas  release barabbas is introduced into the narrative in order to provide a foil to jesus  here is a figure who  unlike jesus   is  guilty of insurrection  and is going to be released at the behest of the crowd in contrast  jesus the innocent one is about to be executed for  basically  insurrection this is  on my reading  luke  s narrative version of a substitutionary theology ,askhistorians,learning,1455676996.0,5.0,0.0,27.0,16414.0,1.0

the reign of peter the great brought about great societal upheavals in 18th century russia which brought the country out of a sort of dark period and attempted to enable russia to catch up to the rest of europe western education was held in a very high regard  the style of dress was altered from a more traditional russian style to one that closely followed western european fashion of the day men were forced to shave their beards or pay a  beard tax   to make the population appear more civilized education in everything from medicine to military strategy was also closely reformed to match that of england  france and the low countries peter and his court travelled regularly to western europe and emulated everything that they deemed might be of help in aiding russia s advancement by the mid to late 19th century  it was not uncommon for a wealthy family to have western european tutors educating their children and the opportunity to send them to a fine western school with a curriculum closely mirroring one that might be found in london or paris unfortunately  this type of education could only be afforded to the upper crust of society  as the vast majority of russia at the time period that  anna karenina  takes place in were farmers with little to no money ,askhistorians,learning,1455676844.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

this passage in the bible makes little sense in the historical context there is generally understood there was a person by the name of jesus executed by the romans  however it was not because the pharisees pressured a roman provincial governor to do so he was executed because he claimed to be the king of the jews and would create a kingdom in judea this was a direct threat to roman authority as it was treason by a subject along with this  he was causing upheaval in province and as a source of this upheaval  he could have been executed  even ignoring this  no roman who had attained that position would give up the choice of who to execute to the rabble of jerusalem  they just would not give up that power to a subject people  the passage was most likely written to show that the romans did not see him as a threat however the vitriolic jewish rabble would rather let a criminal go free than jesus  lending credibility to jesus as the romans did not perceive him as a threat ,askhistorians,learning,1455675072.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4571.0,0.0

both light sources are thermally excited  and you can understand the difference if you can understand both the blackbody spectrum and kirchoff s law of thermal radiation these combine to produce the emission spectrum of any object  a perfect blackbody absorbs all radiation equally when you heat it  statistical mechanics along with the quantized energy of photons determines that it will emit radiation in a continuous blackbody spectrum this has a color that goes from  red to orange to white to bluishwhite   https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons000blackbodycoloursverticalsvg  as the temperature increases  now  a blackbody is an ideal scenario most objects do nt absorb all frequencies this is especially true in gasses  where only a few transitions are allowed to understand the emission spectra of these materials  we need  kirchoff s law   https  enwikipediaorgwikikirchhoff  27s_law_of_thermal_radiation   if you know the absorption spectrum of your material  then the emission spectrum will just be the product of the blackbody curve and the absorption spectrum  this cartoon   http  wwwastrobasbg  petrovherter00_fileslec07_04jpg  sums it up nicely with distinct lines instead of a smooth curve  a hot gas can emit a color determined by both its temperature and the absorption spectrum  despite the fact that the blackbody curve is an approximation  most solids and plasmas emit with something close to a blackbody spectrum this is for a variety of subtle reasons a nearly transparent material might absorb weakly  so it will also emit a weakened version of the blackbody curve also  in a thick material the decreased absorption at some wavelengths is compensated by the increased transparency at that wavelength  light from deeper inside the solid can escape and smooth the blackbody spectrum out at the surface these two effects are easy to see with hot glass it glows with a near blackbody spectrum  but if it is thin enough you can still see through it and it will look less bright ,askscience,learning,1455601505.0,4.0,0.0,42.0,10912.0,0.0

well let s start from the beginning how does you body make energy from food  glucose does nt just magically turn into raw energy that your body can use instead  it is subjected to dozens of chemical reactions performed by enzymes in your body the enzymes are proteins honed over millions of years of evolution for perform basically a single reaction at speeds thousands or millions of times faster than would occur otherwise the pathway that turns glucose into atp  which is the main energy currency of your body is pretty complicated  but if you want a simple image just imagine a factory that takes in coal at one end  and runs a powerplant at the other there are special machines that first clean the coal  then sort the coal  then grade it  then crush it  then transport it  then dump into the furnace that is specially designed for sorted  graded  cleaned coal you could nt just dump a tree  or a container of natural gas in one end  and expect the factory to work  now your body has a lot of enzymes designed to deal with all sorts of compounds and lots of those compounds can end up being turned into atp  energy you body can use   fats and proteins obviously  but also other things  for instance ethanol but importantly  not everything lots of compounds your body has only rudimentary one size fits all  processes to deal with or some compounds  like water  are at the bottom of the energy ladder as far as your body is concerned this is why you ca nt drink petrol and hope to burn it for energy you body has no enzymes to convert it to atp so zero calorie energy drunks have no  or very few  compounds that your body can convert to energy they have no sugar  no protein  no fats just caffeine and water and artificial sweetener  the other thing that i realize now that is throwing you off is the word  energy   energy drinks are so called because the claim to give you a feeling of energy  this is due to caffeine  and perhaps sugar in the nondiet ones   they are not claiming that they supply your body with biologically relevant energy sources  they are claiming they will give you a feeling of energy due to the caffeine ,askscience,learning,1455661966.0,9.0,0.0,216.0,8073.0,0.0

 generating it  could mean many things let s break the question into a few smaller bits     1  can we be sure we know the genetic sequence    we can be pretty confident  but there is a snag when it comes to repeated regions sequencing costs have come down enormously over the past decade  but current techniques rely on sequencing many randomly generated short segments and then using a computer to identify where they overlap to build the genome sequence eukaryotic genomes often have long regions of repeated dna  so if the short segments of dna you sequence are shorter than the length of the repeated region  you will never know how many repeats the original genome had on top of this  the genome is nt quite fixed between cells of one organism  with small alterations building up between the stem cells in different regions as you age these problems are less of a concern in bacteria  but they might pose a larger challenge for making synthetic multicellular life     2  can we generate the genetic sequence synthetically    yes we can only directly synthesize a few hundred bases before errors start to become very common but thanks to tricks like  gibson assembly   https  enwikipediaorgwikigibson_assembly   we can make those short synthetic dna bits assemble into longer sequences again  there is a challenge when it comes to long stretches of repetitive dna  because the reassembled dna might skip a repeated section and these regions can shorten easily during pcr amplification  but these are technical challenges that moneytime can overcome     3  can we put the synthetic genome inside a preexisting cell and make it work    this is at the edge of our abilities now more than 10 years ago viable polio virus was created from  synthetic dna   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent29755831016long   other commenters mentioned the success of  gibson et al   http  sciencesciencemagorgcontent329598752  in generating viable bacteria using synthetic dna but doing this with other species will be trickier dna in multicellular organisms needs to have much more epigenetic regulation than in singlecelled organisms that is because your neurons  skin cells  muscle cells  etc all have  very nearly  the exact same dna in them the epigenetic differences are what differentiates those cells from each other large portions of the genome have to be silenced in a viable cell  and different regions are silenced in different cells this silencing is accomplished through many different mechanisms working at the same time  and there is much we do nt understand even taking existing differentiated cells and and turning them back into stem cells  called  induced pluripotent stem cells   https  enwikipediaorgwikiinduced_pluripotent_stem_cell   is very difficult getting a full  sequence  of all the epigenetic features of a cell line is beyond our current abilities right now if we just tried to exchange a synthetic genome of naked dna into  say  mouse cells  the cells would be reading all the wrong bits of dna at once     4  can we synthesize the rest of the cell    as in  how far away are we from generating life from direct synthesis of not just dna  but the proteins  membranes  etc  this is far  far beyond what we can do cells are extremely efficient factories for generating complex molecules and assembling them into larger functioning units and we do nt even know everything that is in a cell this would be like asking a child with a lego set to build a tesla    tldr   some simple life forms can be generated from synthetic dna right now  but for multicellular organisms this will be much harder ,askscience,learning,1455514917.0,45.0,0.0,42.0,10912.0,0.0

 nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ,askscience,learning,1455663201.0,1.0,0.0,216.0,8073.0,0.0

the sensor that these lenses project their image on is rectangular it s possible to construct a circular sensor and obtain circular pictures  but people tend to prefer rectangular pictures  on the other hand  producing rectangular lenses is more difficult than producing circular ones  so we end up with circular lenses that project an circular image that is larger than the sensor  while the rectangular sensor registers the central part of the image  you can see the effect of the lenses being circular in the image  to some extent a phenomenon called vignetting causes the image to darken as you move away from the center when taking a picture of a uniform background  you can see the corners of the image being slightly darker than the center  the strength of this effect depends on the quality of the lens and the apareture setting used  ,askscience,learning,1455637913.0,12.0,0.0,821.0,19067.0,0.0
this is because of the difference in the heat of moist air vs dry air  the equator receives the most sunlight of any area on earth quite a bit of this solar heating goes into evaporation of water  rather than raising the temperature itself  so the equator itself is a bit cooler than if the earth were bone dry  all this evaporation creates warm  moist air over the equatorial oceans  which begin rising and forming clouds this warm air deposits almost all of its moisture in clouds at equatorial regions  but the air itself continues rising that same air  now very dry  then begins to head in the direction of the poles  but is halted in its journey around  30 degrees latitude  the socalled  horse latitudes   as the coriolis force prevents it from moving more poleward it then proceeds to descend as very dry air around those same latitudes  eventually looping back closer to the surface to the equator  now all this dry descending air around the horse latitudes leads to a vast area of deserts at those locations in the northern hemisphere  there s the american southwest  the sahara  and the middle east in the southern hemisphere  there s the atacama desert in chile  the kalahari desert in namibia  and the australian outback obviously not everywhere at these latitudes is desert  since local currents can affect the area s climate  but deserts are the general trend  so why is it hotter there  it turns out that compressing dry air as it descends from high altitudes over these deserts will raise the temperature quite a bit more than the temperature decreased as it rose over the moist equator decompressing moist air in general  moist air changes temperature about 6 degrees c per km  while dry air changes about 10 degrees c per km this is because moist air recoups some of the heat lost to the original evaporation when that water vapor condenses as clouds as latest heat  so we start at 30 c over the equator and lift up the moist air to 3 km where clouds are formed  losing moisture as clouds  and the nowdry air is at 12 c the dry air then continues upwards up to about 10 km  where the additional 7 km of height decrease the temperature down to 58 c it travels poleward  when it then descends the 10 km as dry air over the horse latitudes  where it s now heated to 42 c  hotter than it originally was at the equator ,askscience,learning,1455475284.0,66.0,0.0,975.0,48236.0,1.0

the words  perpendicular    orthogonal  and  normal  all essentially mean  meeting at right angles    unfortunately  the term  normal  itself means several different  unrelated things  depending on the context  generally  you can interchange all three terms and no one will care however  there are actually subtle differences between the terms or  at the very least  cases where one term is used predominantly over the others   we say that two vectors  arrows  or lines are perpendicular if they meet each other  intersect each other  at right angles the term  perpendicular  is generally used only for this geometrical concept  and usually only when referring to perpendicular lines or vectors   a collection of vectors  elements of an abstract inner product space  are orthogonal if their inner product is zero when the inner product space is r   n  with the usual euclidean inner product  this is the same as  perpendicular   almost two lines can have orthogonal direction vectors  yet not be perpendicular themselves  eg  the lines do nt intersect   if the inner product space is not r   n   then there really is no geometrical counterpart to orthogonality for instance  the functions sin  x  and cos  x  are orthogonal in l   2    0  2pi    note also that we can speak of  orthogonal collections  of vectors  but we usually do nt say  perpendicular collections    if a vector meets a surface at right angles  then we say that the vector is normal to the surface we could just say that they are perpendicular  but there is a certain assymetry in this case since one of the objects is a surface  ie  not a line or other vector   so we use a different term  which is  normal   again  no one will really think twice if you talk about two vectors in some abstract vector space being normal or a vector being perpendicular to a surface or two lines being orthogonal it s just that in each of those cases  we tend to use different terms if you had to choose one term as a safe catchall  i would go with  orthogonal   in any case where you can use any of these three terms   orthogonal  pretty much never sounds awkward  unlike the other two ,askscience,learning,1455500544.0,31.0,0.0,1.0,25354.0,1.0

without the chip  any compromised terminal can copy the information on the card this allows for fraudulent payment even while the card holder maintains possession of the card  which means the fraud is often not discovered until much later the chip facilitates the use of encryption  so that the particular information from the card and the processor network received by the terminal are only valid for that specific transactionthe data can still be copied  but can not be used for new transactions and is therefore useless  the  mass migration  is because the credit card networks are now incentivizing merchants in the us to accept the chipif they do not  they bear the cost of fraud  and not the issuer  as with most fraud   so now not only will the issuers benefit from issuing chipenabled cards  but the merchants will want to accept and use those cards as well ,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455644353.0,17.0,0.0,24.0,32322.0,1.0

planes in the air are still affected by gravity in order for them to stay off the ground  a force has to be applied in the opposite direction of gravity  aka lift   now planes can get lift two ways the common way is using wings as air moves over the wings  the shape pushes most of it down increasing pressure under the wing and decreasing it above you can experience this yourself by sticking your hand out of a car window the second way in some jet powered aircraft  the force of the engine is enough to lift the plane without using wings this works the same way as letting go of the end of a balloon both of these are contingent on having enough air to either power the jet engine  or provide lift under the wings as planes fly higher  the air gets thinner until it is not enough to power the engines or provide enough lift under the wings to get to space  you need a rocket that brings its own air with it to power its engines,explainlikeimfive,learning,1455682679.0,1.0,0.0,114.0,16146.0,0.0

first  some background information   nasa powers outer solar system probes  such as  new horizons   https  enwikipediaorgwikinew_horizons   with  radioisotope thermoelectric generators   https  enwikipediaorgwikiradioisotope_thermoelectric_generator   rtgs   these are passive nuclear systems fueled by the decay of  plutonium238   https  enwikipediaorgwikiplutonium238   pu238    there is an  impending bottleneck   http  wwwscientificamericancomarticlewithinnasaaplutoniumpowerstruggle  in the supply of pu238 due to a decadeslong hiatus in its production by the us department of energy  which will somewhat limit outer planet probe options in coming years  at least beyond jupiter  where highefficiency solar cells have become practical    pu238 is a specific isotope of plutonium that  when produced at high grades  efficiently generates heat by its radioactive decay it is not the same as plutonium isotopes used in producing nuclear fission fuel or weapons  and as such nasa can not simply borrow plutonium from these applications probegrade pu238 must specifically be manufactured   this manufacturing has recently restarted at a low level  but it will take years to ramp up two years of effort in 2014 and 2015 were required to create the first 50 grams of rtggrade plutonium under the new production  and at an 8figure cost that congress had balked at for years the rate will increase  of course  but   kilograms   of the isotope are needed for each rtgpowered probe  and only 15 kg of new fuel are expected to be produced by 2021  now  i ve been reading up on apollo 13  and an  interesting factoid   https  enwikipediaorgwikiapollo_13  spacecraft_location  came to my attention  the apollo 13 lunar module  lm  was ditched into the pacific ocean when the crew reentered earth s atmosphere in the command module  on board that lm were a series of longterm lunar experiments  and a certain type of generator to power them guess what kind of generator  yup  an rtg with 38 kilograms of pu238  none of which was ever used because the apollo 13 lm never landed  and thus the fuel was never inserted into the generator for the experiments  to avoid contaminating the oceans with radioactive material in the event of aborts or accidents  that particular design of rtg  the  snap27   https  enwikipediaorgwikisystems_for_nuclear_auxiliary_power  snap27   was designed to   survive reentry intact    and it reportedly did so in the apollo 13 return ongoing monitoring of the area has not detected radioactive leaks  i m sure you see where this is going  but there are specific questions that are worth asking    1  what would be the condition of that fuel after almost half a century of passive decay    since i am not a nuclear engineer  i ca nt answer this categorically wikipedia says the halflife of pu238 is 877 years probe rtgs degrade in function much more quickly than that because the radioactivity erodes their physical components  and because power output declines as the decay proceeds  but in this case we are only interested in the state of the fuel  so  if  this is a straightforward matter of applying the halflife  a strong majority of that 38 kilograms should not yet have decayed in the 46 years since apollo 13 is that the case  and if so  does this decay ratio directly indicate the amount of useful fuel available  let s assume the fuel is largely undecayed  the next questions would be about getting to it the apollo 13 snap27 was impacted into the  tonga trench   https  enwikipediaorgwikitonga_trench   an area of the south pacific just north of new zealand  at a depth of about 61 kilometers    2  does nasa have a good fix on the location of the snap27    if the landing ellipse for the rtg is a significant span of ocean floor  then this concept dies here  the time and money to find it would cancel out any advantage to nasa of recovering the fuel if they know where it is  or have it within a narrow range  then it s worth continuing to explore    3  what is the practicality of recovering it    to give a sense of the size of a snap27  here s a photo of one on the moon  https  uploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbb3snap27_on_the_moonjpg you can see from the footprints in the background that it s quite small so that means finding it would be somewhat harder if nasa s idea of its location is more generalized  but also means that picking it up and taking it away once it s found would be trivial  assuming no leaks are detected  since that would invoke strict environmental protocols that would preclude transporting it  from the violence of reentry and ocean impact  most likely it s nothing more than a cylinder  by now covered is some thickness of seafloor muck visual identification would therefore be harder  and of course you would  hope  that it could nt be detected by its heat  for the reasons mentioned before so the operational side of immediately finding the object  even if its location is closely known  would not be trivial  systems exist  and have existed for a long time  that are capable of operating at 6 km and recovering an object that small  especially robotic submersibles james cameron has personally been nearly  twice as deep   http  wwwcbsnewscomnewsjamescameronreachesrecord7mileoceandepth   so the recovery technology is not in question  the weak link would just be seeing it we can speculate about various sensor methods  magnetic  seismic  etc  but this remains an open question    4  if recovered and processed  would the total cost and time yield significant net advantages to nasa outer planets exploration    of course the skeptic s temptation is just to say  if it were worthwhile  they would already be doing it   but that does nt reflect the reality of a bureaucratic federal institution that is constantly buffeted by both internal and congressional politics the fact that they are not currently trying to recover the apollo 13 plutonium means almost nothing  since of course every idea has to start somewhere  even if there had already been proposals that went nowhere  there are so many nontechnical reasons why that happens that it usually does mean nothing  eg  if the department under which the proposal occurred got its budget cut and did nt have the time to investigate it  the individual pushing for it left nasa  or died  or found a more interesting project  it was passed from one office to another until people just forgot about it  etc etc the vast majority of ideas that ever come up  go nowhere for reasons like that  so neither answer to this question would be shocking  that it would be a complete waste of time and money that s already been thoroughly investigated and rejected  or that it would make sense but just never came up in any place high enough to matter  the fact that nasa is  optimistically   one might even say desperately  touting the planned creation of a mere 15 kg of new fuel over the next halfdecade  an absurdly long timeline that even then is sparking skepticism due to low funding levels  suggests this might be worth a look      update  according to  this article   http  wwwspacesafetymagazinecomaerospaceengineeringnuclearpropulsionwillanyonerecoverapollo13splutonium   courtesy of schroedingerspen in comments  the fuel has decayed too far and would also be too difficult to locate it does nt give many details on that  but it is a plausible answer from a credible source greater details would be appreciated if anyone has them in any case  the plutonium issue is a fascinating one to explore irrespective of the apollo 13 question   ,space,learning,1455522864.0,46.0,0.0,30544.0,74640.0,0.0

explanation of the   7   rule  since it took me a minute to understand  your number  say  889  is split into 10x  y  or 880  9   we want to know if 10x  y divides by 7     so we multiply by 5   10x  y   5  50x  5y  multiplying a number by 5 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume m and n are integers a number   7m  n    where n is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  multiplies by 5 to become   35m  5n    dividing evenly by 7 must remove the 35m  leaving 5n 5n will not divide by 7 unless n  is  7  therefore if   7m  n   is not divisible by 7  neither is the product of it and 5     we then subtract 49x  which is   always   divisible by 7  and 7y  which is also   always   divisible by 7    50x  5y    49x  7y   x  2y  subtracting a multiple of 7 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume p  q  and r are integers a number   7p  r    where r is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  subtracts some value   7q    the difference remaining is 7p  7q  r  or   7  pq   r    because p and q are integers  pq must also be an integer  meaning 7  pq  is a multiple of 7 the remainder when 7  pq   r is therefore r as with the original number  meaning if   7p  r   is not divisible by 7  neither is the difference between it and a number that  is  divisible by 7     therefore  to see if a number of the form 10x  y    88   0    9    is divisible by 7  we may test x  2y    88      18    instead  hope this was helpful      ps this method is way easier than the godawful  1024  method  or however it worked   plus  this one chains    889  7   8818   7  70  7   70   7  7  7 ,youshouldknow,learning,1452673203.0,1.0,0.0,2174.0,19864.0,0.0

i m not sure rfrugal is where you want to seek information for this particular transaction you re asking if this a good deal for a car that fulfills more than just your needs in a vehicle if you need four wheels and a roof  no the car is not a frugal purchase or great  deal  if you have 17k to spend and want a small suv  no it still is not a great deal however  if you want a toyota highlander that is not exceptionally old  has a reasonable amount of miles for the model year  and is available for sale it is worth considering understand that having been a fleet vehicle means that at one time it was a car owned by a company and driven by multiple drivers that may have abused the car  hence the slightly higher than average miles per year  it also means that there was most likely scheduled maintenance checks and repairs done in order to keep the vehicle on the road to transport said potential abusers this company also probably had a milage cap on when they would sell off the vehicle before repairs were costlywhen value would nose dive personally if you are not mechanically inclined i would stay away from any former fleer vehicles  they are great deals on auction but there is a lot of inherent risk and potential cost in these vehicles ,frugal,lifestyle,1455375867.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0

another thing to consider is the home s actual energy efficiency  rather than just the energy star label  although an energy star label is usually a good sign of energy efficiency   see if any of the builders will give you a hers score for their buildings a hers is like the miles per gallon for your house a standard code house has a score of 100  on average across the country  and a net zero energy house has a score of 0 the lower the score  the more efficient the house  in addition  you ll want an  asbuilt  score as opposed to an  as designed  score an  as designed  score means that the house in theory is a certain level of energy efficient  but that they have not tested the built house to see if flaws in construction have made the score worse  they do   an  as built  score means that they have built a house  it has been tested  and it has received an energy efficiency hers score of a certain amount  a hers score is also tested and given by a third party  so a builder can not simply give themselves a good score ,frugal,lifestyle,1455544321.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0

this is my freshly sbr d cz scorpion evo 3 s1 it s a 9mm parabellum blowback rifle made in the czech republic by cz it started life as a  pistol  and it was trash  if you know only one thing about this gun it needs to be that without a stock it sucks ass but with a stock it s a blast to shoot and will bring a smile to anyone s face i m going to give you my thoughts on it in case you re thinking about getting one  for pros of this gun i d say it feels great in the hands even though it s a little over six pounds  it s a good weight it feels very solid when you re shooting it secondly its pretty accurate i was able to hit the steel plate at 150m with this very easily as long as my hold over was correct this gun is also just fun to shoot  between having very little recoil and slapping the bolt closed on a fresh mag  operating it is just different than a ar15 or ak i also think this gun looks very cool  its different then most other popular guns out right now mags are really pretty cheap  you can get them for  20 a pop which is nice the stock is very solid and works well to really sum up the pros of this gun  its just plain fun  now for the cons  which there are many like i said earlier this gun sucks as a pistol  one of the reasons being the ambi safety it rubs your finger and even breaks the skin after a while when you shoot so i bought the ambi safety delete from cz then there s the trigger  holy shit it s just bad  i really hope someone makes a smooth aftermarket trigger for it i replaced some of the springs to make it lighter  and it s still dog shit and now we get to the rails at the front  they are very uncomfortable to the point where im going to have to buy some rail covers for them  so if you re thinking should i buy this gun  you need to first ask yourself do you want to sbr it if the answer is no then do nt get the cz evo  but if you are willing to get the stock for it it makes a great little rifle that s tons of fun to shoot and is nt like anything else at the range i m not saying its better than the mpx or the ak9 or an ar15 in 9mm or whatever but it is a good gun if your looking for something fun to take to the range   here   http  imgurcomazvmbv  are a couple extra photos i took today ,guns,lifestyle,1455657743.0,13.0,0.0,3989.0,3010.0,0.0

make sure to switch your dryer circuit on your fuse box to off and unplug the dryer  open the door to your dryer and you should see two screws on the upper corners of door recess on the front panel  this will allow you to lift off and remove the top panel of the dryer  now you will see one screw in each of the upper inside edges of the dryers front panel  remove those and the front panel will be free put this forward and it will release itself from the drum of the dryer  the lip that the dryer drum was resting on is where you will see the dryer bearings they are plastic  same as the nalgene bottle  or teflon tabs that are about 1cmx6cm in size with a hole on the right side and both ends tucked into the plastic housing if your dryer is squeaky  one or more of these bearings are worn through and you have metal on metal contact  hence the squeaking    here is a picture of where the dryer bearings are located   http  imgurcomgalleryej3fo96   here is a picture of what the bearings look like   http  imgurcomscerexx  take your nalgene bottle  the old milky white ones with the blue lid  not the newer hard shatterproof ones  and use some heavy scissors to cut a strip of the bottle that is wide enough that it will just barely fit into the slots on the lip where the bearings go drill or puncture a hole in the strip so that both sides tuck into the slots and the hole catches the little prong repeat with all worn bearings  now you can stick your hand into the inside of the dryer barrel and lift the front end back onto the lip where the bearings are and close the dryer in the reverse of the order you took it apart  enjoy dry clothes without the horrible squeaking  also  if the lip where the bearings are located is broken to the point where you can not install new bearings  you can order a new bearing unit online for a few bucks and extend the life of your dryer  cheers ,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455517063.0,3.0,0.0,159.0,7958.0,0.0

one of your assumptions is wrong we all like to concentrate on that type of accident where the biker is riding along minding his own business and out of nowhere comes a lunatic in a car who kills him of course that can and does happen  but in  too  many many accidents the biker is partly to blame according to david hough  proficient motorcycling  40  of motorcycle fatalities had a bac of 010  or above in addition  way too many bikers ride way too fast and careless for traffic conditions  you have only to check youtube to verify that there are also too many new bikers and returning bikers who do nt get proper instruction those are the catagories of bikers who are highly represented in the fatality and serious injury columns avoid those things and you have heavily slanted the odds in your favor do nt drink  drug  and ride  do nt ride like an idiot  and get all the instruction and practice you can and you will not guarantee your survival but you can count on it being a pretty unlikely event that might get you ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672670.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,333.0,0.0

you can limit your risk a lot of accidents happen at night so do nt ride at night a lot of accidents happen in rain and on ice do nt ride when the weather is bad a lot of accidents involve aggressive riding do nt ride aggressively other accidents involve lane splitting  do nt lane split you ca nt make motorcycling perfectly safe this way  but you can eliminate around 80  of the risk ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455676215.0,1.0,0.0,59.0,13073.0,0.0

just do the msf even if you do it and decide that riding is not for you  you will be a better driver for it  more aware of riders around you  checking lanes more closely and more it s a great experience and you get to learn in a safe environment just pull the trigger on this small expense  megagateway experience to riding ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455682743.0,1.0,0.0,1277.0,3692.0,0.0
i know that question sounds weird  but i have the same problem every year taxes come around  start getting hyped for the warm months  then the thought starts to cross my mind to finally get a bike i start to plan everything out  take some days off  start getting information from local msf courses  glue my eyes to craigslist  etc and then  like clockwork  some gruesome video or story pops up about some rider getting creamed by a car  no fault of their own  and i immediately rethink the decision just the thought of riding excites me but the fear of getting into an unavoidable accident always drives me away how do i get over this feeling  or what did it take for those in a similar situation ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455671396.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,34.0,0.0
the fear or innate feeling of uncertainty is nt something that goes for me do i fear that which i have no control over  sure but it s up to me to be ruled by it or to own it and do with it what i will since in the same vein you have no control over your body  while its not common you could goto sleep tonight and never wake up  brain aneurysm  heart failure  etc the same things that happen on a motorcycle can happen in a car you could get swiped by a kid in his sweet lifted truck and end up 6 feet under  honestly there s no real way to say do this and this and it wo nt bother you in my opinion i would nt want to be oblivious to the dangers being oblivious or ruled by them makes for poor judgement and oftentimes does more damage than understanding and using this fear as motivation to be better  vigilant  perceptive and proactive about your safety  how long it takes you to get to that point is all up to you man  good luck  hope to see you with some wheels soon ,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455672019.0,1.0,0.0,129.0,1662.0,0.0

 before amp  after   http  mimgurcomaigytu  i posted in rloseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone s stories about being healthy and losing weight  mine basically started with the fact that i have depression which is something that i ve always had to deal with and always will but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca nt change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i m overweight  i hated how i could nt fit into any stylish clothes  just sweats and 2xl tshirts from walmart i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could nt fit into anymore i hated how i could nt go outside one of those pics i m in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that s not a very healthy way to live life  around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would nt miss for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go and then i cut out alcohol within the first month i lost 2530 pounds right there then i cut out red meat  which did wonders for my energy i also started walking everywhere workschoolshopping  and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs  you get the picture after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing  kick boxing and jiu jitsu i ve always loved mma and it s amazing what all of those  boxing especially  did for my muscle and weight loss really toned up my shoulders as well  i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do nt notice it and it s so good for you  just baby steps losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on   these are all pics of me throughout 2014 when i was at my heaviest  302 lbs    http  imgurcomanoeop   this is me as of last weekend   http  imgurcomamloql ,progresspics,lifestyle,1455595523.0,75.0,0.0,23973.0,38032.0,0.0

last i was talking to people that did it  chaturbate was the best for couples  income varies greatly based on time on screen  the flow of users  time of day and year  etc generally  unless you do it as a full time job  you re not going to be able to pay the bills doing it you can generate enough to supplement things nicely though low end that i ve heard equals out to three or four bucks an hour high end can equate to thirty plus  if you re doing it for fun that you get paid for  there s nothing to lose  but be aware that once it s on the internet  it s there pretty much forever you can guarantee that eventually someone will capture the stream and spread iti knew a couple that wore masks on cam  sometimes costumes as well  overall  it s a difficult field to turn into regular  reliable income  but it can be great for extra pocket money,sex,lifestyle,1455594971.0,8.0,0.0,20.0,8749.0,0.0

my  22f  boyfriend  23m  of 7 months got the results of his most recent lab work today and found out that he has hsv1 based on my last testing  done in december of last year  i don  t have it  but i do plan on getting testing again soon despite me telling him that it  s very common and that the symptoms are not always severe  he believes that his life is over as he knows it he feels that he  ll never be able to have a regular relationship  get married  have kids  etc many of the things he wanted to do prior to receiving the diagnosis  i am still interested in being with him  but he  s really worried about transmitting it to me i told him that it  s still possible to engage in activities with the diagnosis and that just because one partner has it  the other one is not guaranteed to get it and maybe this sounds na  ve  but even if i were to get it  in my opinion herpes is basically a skin condition that may or may not flare up that is usually otherwise benign in other words  though i would not like to not get it  it would not be the end of the world if i did also  because it is so common  i feel like even if i don  t get it from him  there  s a fair chance that i could get it in the future  am i being na  ve  is he being overly dramatic  or is it a combination of the two  what should i tell him  also  he plans to get retested and i plan to get tested again this week  edit 1  he was diagnosed via blood test for igg antibodies tl  dr boyfriend recently diagnosed with hsv1  feels life is over,sex,lifestyle,1455667737.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

i m a pretty ugly guy  there is very little about my face or body that would be considered attractive i know attraction is subjective  but i highly doubt any woman would consider me a 7 or above i imagine the subjectivity of attraction means i range from 25  maybe a 6 if i m particularly witty that day and i m not saying i only want supermodels  but i do want women i m attracted to given that there is nothing physically attractive about me  going for women who have attractive features means i m batting out of my league  it s well understood by almost everyone that attraction is an important part of a relationship  and pretty much the only factor in a hookup or fuck buddy situation nobody wants a relationship without attraction  that s just a friendship but when it comes to ugly people  apparently this does nt apply i m told to lower my standards  and take what i can get i should be grateful for unfulfilling sex with women i m not attracted to if i want a one night stand  it has to be with a woman as ugly as me  which is nt very tempting if i want a relationship  i m supposed to look past the physical and see the inner beauty  even though no woman with options would ever do that for me  i see a lot of unattractive couples  but honestly i think they re with each other because that s all they can get  and they both know it there s no passion  no attraction  no lust it s just that or dying alone you can call me shallow  but how many of you would date someone you were nt attracted to  i ve never felt passion  chemistry or mutual attraction i ve never been desired or lusted after if good looking women are nt attracted to me  why would an unattractive woman fancy me  the answer is they would nt  they d be settling for me just like i d be settling for them  and the relationship would be a sexless  passionless sham  is there any hope for people like me  am i making sense  or is this all just depressive bullshit  if so  why  tldri feel like i ll never have a good sexual relationship because the women i want are nt attracted to me  and the women i could get would just be settling for me  and i d be settling for them ,sex,lifestyle,1455658500.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,249.0,0.0

a thread here got me thinking about something i just realized i ve never thought to ask before when my wife and i have piv sex  we do the usual inoutinout about a quarter of the time  and the other 34 we grind against each other s pelvises  for her the grinding simulates her clit and deepspot  for me it s twofold it feels like she s either milking me or gnashing the tip of my penis hard against the end of her vagina now  that second sensation is only possible because my cock is slightly longer than her pussy is deep there s about a quarter of an inch of shaft that either does nt go in  or if it does  it s because my penis is slightly bent inside her if she was half an inch deeper  this sensation would be completely gone  i know because i ve had exes that were deeper  now  on to my question when you  or your partner  grinds is there a sense of  completeness   for lack of better terms  if the penis is slightly larger than what the vagina can fully engulf  or conversely  is there a sense of lacking if the opposite were the case ,sex,lifestyle,1455656698.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,553.0,0.0

one way to start is with massage my gf really likes being touched  both in a relaxing and in a  get in the mood  kind of way it s a nice  slow  affectionate way to get her naked and put my hands all over her then eventually i m kissing my way down her spine and she s wiggling her hips toward the edge of the bed and things heat up from there  one way to finish is with a leisurely  round 2   after a nice hard fuck i ll need a minute  or two  to catch my breath  kiss and cuddle and while i m not always physically capable of repeating an  a  game of vigorous sexual athleticism  sometimes it s nice to just roll over into the spooning position and reenter my partner it s not about chasing another orgasm  well  not to begin with anyway   it s just about the wonderful feeling of holding her tightly as our hips rock together  joining our bodies as deeply as possible while i kiss her neck and tell her how wild she drives me  i mean it  is  sex  and it usually leads to more sex and more orgasms but it does nt have to  and it s not the sort of thing you need to warm up with stretches for ,sex,lifestyle,1455666633.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,86.0,0.0
me and my girl kind of have a similar issue she s very into just getting fucked  the more control i take and the more i basically use her sexually the better for her most of the time she likes it rough and manhandley  sometimes though we like to get more lovey and passionate it does nt happen often but when it does its always spur of the moment the other day we were visiting my parents and we were getting a little freaky at night time started having fairly hot sex but it was getting a bit loud cuz of body contact and bed and we heard the bathroom door down the hall close and she hopped off immediately kind of panicked and we got under the covers but we were both still turned on and she reached back and guided me in  so we start having sex spooning and i do nt know what it was but man did that heat up  we were grinding into each other and grabbing each other like we ve never done before she could nt keep in her moans and pulled my hand up to cover her mouth we were biting and clawing at each other it was so hot we were moving together so well omg best sex in a loooong time  anyway just let it happen but just do positions that enhance intimacy spooning works well for us ,sex,lifestyle,1455671993.0,4.0,0.0,31.0,1978.0,0.0
so i know this kinda fits into the  orgasm troubles  bit in the faq but it s different hear me out  i m in my early 20s  have been masturbating since before i started kindergarden  not that i knew what it was  and apparently doing it wrong or so i m led to believe at the moment  there s a very specific position for me to be in  a very specific amount of pressure to apply to a very specific area and a very specific motion i also like visualising myself in situations that i could nt be in in real life now  do nt get me wrong  this is quite useful because i can get myself off from no arousal in about 2 minutes by myself  the problem is  i have a partner now i have no insecurities  except for fear that i will take too long  or spectatoring issues with him there s plenty of foreplay and we re pretty open so i do tell him what i like etc and he puts a great deal of effort and time into helping me but in the end i always have to revert to my own way  which is also quite  closed  to his further participation due to the position  and by then i feel horrible about how i could nt orgasm   and also feel bad about the visualisation because it feels like i want to cheat on him if that makes sense   so it takes a while for me too i can tell he feels awful about this  i tried masturbating in other ways but when i m not paying attention i find that i always revert to my own movement so that did nt work i also tried not masturbating for a long time before one of our sessions and that did nt help either  what do    tldr  girl has been masturbating the same way for the longest time  nothing else gets her off thus having issues with boyfriend  needs help fixing them  ,sex,lifestyle,1455649373.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0

hey  all i ve posted several times in here with questions about my inability to orgasm  and each time  you ve all been very helpful  i m at the point where i m sensitive every time we have sex piv penetration always feels  great   if he starts rubbing my clit during penetration  even better  because my legships start shaking 80  of the time i m getting really wet  i m really happy  i m super turned on and loving every second of it  so where s the orgasm  i ve been told to try fantasizing during sex  but that does nt really work for me i ve tried  and i always wind up wondering what it is exactly i should be thinking about  which takes me away from the moment  which is the opposite of what i need to come  my so helped me learn how to grind to hit my gspot while i m on top  and that always feels awesome  but i think when it starts to feel too good i ca nt keep going with the same intensity  which means i ca nt get there it s like i get too weak or something i m not sure how it happens  when i was asking him about my gspot  lol  bizarre  right   he suggested i explore down there by myself  but i do nt know what to do i ve tried masturbation in the past and it s always boring and does nt feel good it does nt feel bad  but it feels like nothing i guess i just ca nt get turned on enough by myself  even with the help of porn or erotica or anything like that  suggestions ,sex,lifestyle,1455668312.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,690.0,0.0

my couple of initial thoughts on troubleshooting this be to try it on top of underwear  as maybe it s a little too specific or intense or that the vibrator is more on the  buzzy  side and a more  rumbly  one could feel a better and just in case  make sure she s aroused  as lots of unaroused clits do nt like to be messed with ,sex,lifestyle,1455656175.0,2.0,0.0,1824.0,3874.0,0.0

sounds like you re not using it right if she s not really aroused or the vibration is too pinpointed on one spot a lot of times i get that tickled feeling too you need to let her use the vibrator on her own to figure out exactly what she likes  probably in private  without you  and then she can show you for me its a combo of making little circle motions around my clit area with my legs kinda spaced apart pressing down on one spot or just shoving it down her pants is nt going to do much a lot of times if you re not doing it right it either tickles like crazy or if its directly on the clit it can be somewhat painful so just be careful if you re doing it to her let her completely figure it out and then show you my bf puts me on my stomach  ass up  and sits in between my legs and plays with it like that and it drives me to orgasm almost every single time figure out what she likes and do nt be afraid to try every single position  sometimes that detail is all it takes ,sex,lifestyle,1455684960.0,1.0,0.0,11467.0,88.0,0.0

if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,conservative,news,1455658094.0,1.0,0.0,137571.0,11206.0,0.0

it s true that there are certain market inefficiencies that exist one example is skewed distribution of wealth that results in some people not being able to afford important goods or services like healthcare  the question must be asked though  is the market inefficiency worse than the government inefficiency  to use the threat of violence to confiscate resources from each other to reallocate towards the priorities of the majority  in this case govt healthcare   comes with great costs as well  the answer to this question can only come from study of history to see which markets and societies have enjoyed the greatest levels of prosperity  i believe that most people in this sub have observed that the greatest levels of prosperity  including the highest quality and quantity of medical care provided  have been in the countries with the greatest respect for individual liberty  many countries have failed to provide even moderate levels of care because they trusted the collective to allocate society s resources rather than the individual for example  during the cuban revolution  high quality universal healthcare was among the highest priorities of the government large amounts of resources were committed to healthcare and in some ways  the population benefited in the short term however  the sacrifices that came with the loss of individual liberty and respect for private property were great the productivity of the country fell and ultimately the level of care  and general quality of life  was not as great as it might have been  tl  dr   in practice  respect for individual liberty leads to better healthcare outcomes than socialism  ,libertarian,news,1455673487.0,2.0,0.0,441.0,1976.0,0.0

the author  a journalist  notes that coverage of antivaccination efforts have a surprisingly long history  dating back to the 1980s  and points out that these articles have been couched in the same way throughout  with antivaccination views derided as antiscience further noting that explanation of the science did not actually change the views of antivaccination advocates  she digs deeper and finds that many of these views were not so much a rejection of the science as they were a rejection of the idea that they should accept individual risk  for their children  for the public good in paying closer attention to what these advocates have said  she argues that their views are largely antiauthoritarian  resisting  mandatory  vaccination  rather than antiscience  rejecting or misunderstanding the  fact  of public benefit from vaccination   and posits that this makes it a moral rather than scientific debate  with implications for the relevant publichealth communications ,truereddit,news,1455663149.0,2.0,0.0,450.0,3095.0,0.0

i think the whole thing blindsided gus it was nt just that walt murdered two drug dealers with his car  it was also that the dealers had killed that child they hired i do nt believe gus ever meant for them to do that when he said  no more kids   he would have wanted jesse to approach him so he could deal with his employees himself after all  even if gus could nt care less about the child  having his drug dealers commit that murder drew a huge amount of media and law enforcement attention it was a dumb move  period but instead  jesse went after the drug dealers and walt killed them boom more media and law enforcement attention gus had to be furious and a bit overwhelmed  i feel like he probably thought of walt as a safe bet walt is a family man  a teacher  and dying of cancer he s apologetic and collapses under pressure if i were gus  i d never expect walt to go out and run over two drug dealers walt proved himself to be unpredictable and dangerous by doing that therefore  he was a risk gus did nt care to take any longer  gus understood walt s pleas to protect jesse  i think the fact that he met with jesse and heard him out when jesse planned to poison the drug dealers speaks to that jesse at that point was nothing to gus but gus understood he meant the world to walt he gave jesse a chance  and even told him that walt was the only reason jesse got that chance  i do think gus understood walt s reasons for killing the dealers to protect and support jesse but i also think that was nt a factor in whether walt was to live gus had gale  who was thoroughly innocuous  sweet  and consistently loyal gale knew the recipe walt  on the other hand  had just shown his volatility which is the last thing gus needed if he wanted to stay hidden in plain sight i think he decided to have walt killed not because he could nt understand why walt killed the dealers  but because walt  like victor a few episodes later  had become a liability ,breakingbad,television,1455078161.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,5962.0,0.0
there may have been more to motivate walt than just altruism by keeping jesse in his corner  he was close with the only person who might  theoretically  be able to replace him as a cook this gave him leverage over gus that he would not have with gale as an assistant ,breakingbad,television,1455061301.0,1.0,0.0,307.0,48779.0,1.0

gus s reaction to walter s actions in halfmeasure  murdering two of his dealers to save jesse  are to kill walter at the first opportunity as long at the cook can continue without him if anyone could understand walter s actions should nt it be gus who lost his best friendpossible lover to the cartel setting up a 20 year revenge scheme  up until the flashback introduction of max  gus seemed emotionless and i assumed he just did nt understand the loyaltyfriendship between walter and jesse but after that it seems like a real blind spot for him to care so deeply about max to the point where he d betray his employer and yet not understand walter s feelings about jesse and what he d do to protect him ,breakingbad,television,1455057654.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,479.0,0.0

in the season 2 episode  abed s uncontrollable christmas   when searching for the meaning of christmas abed discovers it is actually a lost season 1 box set although it is just a metaphor for a lack of payoff in the show and in abed s mind  it also makes a good metaphor for community as a whole  in lost and community a group of damaged strangers end up stuck somewhere they do nt want to be but end up working together to overcome the obstacles and adventures they face throughout lost and community it is revealed that all of these characters are connected through their pasts and it was destiny that they ended up where they are  season 4  wherein harmon got booted from the show  saw the beginning of problems for the show  and it was widely hated by fans lost also faced this problem in it s 4th season facing the writer s strike  the season was cut down and also marked a low point for most fans it was also in this season of lost where some of the survivors finally made it off the island  much like jeff finally leaving greendale mirroring this  jack  the leader of the group in lost  and jeff both soon experience their lives falling apart when they try to get back to what they were before this leads both of them back to where they originally did nt want to be in both season 5 s along with reuniting the remaining members of the groups both shows saw problems in the real world that resulted in the loss of characters on the show and altered plot lines notably pierce and troy in community and mr eko or walt from lost  which brought in new characters on both shows to fill in the gaps  both shows end with season 6  for now   and fans of both will say that the quality of both fell over the last three seasons fans of both will also argue about the quality of the last seasons as well  including the finales in the end of both the remaining characters come together and move on together for the most part so in that box in season 2  abed found the answer to his quest  but he also found a clue to what the rest of his series would be like   a lack of payoff  while both shows do have their problems in their second halves  i do think they are both worth it and great television ,community,television,1454471559.0,8.0,0.0,796.0,1067.0,0.0

i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length ,himym,television,1454901150.0,1.0,0.0,395.0,7822.0,0.0

so  i m in my first viewing of voyager  and i have to say that this is probably one of the funniest episodes i have seen so far  there are other pure comedy episodes but this one takes the cake the doctor is such a lovable character  looking for parmac  spelling   in all the wrong places  our man bashir  little green men  that episode with barclay in tng when he goes  james bondish   bride of chaotica  mmm those come to mind right now  i m certain there are others  but this one is just 45 minutes of grinning and laughing with a few  serious  moments to catch your breath  and i like it when star trek goes out of its way to make something lighthearted and fun amidst all the starfleet protocol  so anyway  season 6  and i have to say that voyager is way better than people make it out to be  it does have its problems  but if you are watching a series about a starship that can travel faster than the speed of light  a few extra shuttlecrafts or writers with hangover once in a while should not be your main focus  he caracters are great  just like every other series  even when they start very lame and unlikable  they grow on you a lot  even neelix  for example  piccard s1e1 was a dick  tucker s1e1 was generic texas boy  bashir uggghhh  even the sisko  you get the idea  anyway  i m getting close to complete the whole voyage  but looking forward to july and even more to 2017  llap ,startrek,television,1455665751.0,14.0,0.0,5229.0,4619.0,0.0
it took me quite i while to get into but i ended up enjoying enterprise  not quite as much as the others but still some good memories that is  when i wasnt getting angry at the forced love plot  with trip and tpol or the blatent and obscene sexing up of her character unlike many i enjoyed the long arch of the expanse  anyhow enough on that for now what else can scratch the trek itch  i havent gotten through all of ds9 yet mainly because i found the religious stuff hard to palate but if i got through all of enterprise s trangressions i imagine ds9 will be tame in comparison  what else is there non trek  since ive watched them all now apart from the remainder of ds9  i am trying babylon 5 again since it has alot of rave reviews and high sci fi cred from all ive read i dont expect super special effects but the show is so low budget i find it jarring and hard to get into i saw an episode with some ant creature and it was star trek original series bad and the sets seem so cramped it gives the impression of being filmed in someones backyard garage i will keep trying with it though maybe things smooth out  i mean tng was filmed before that by quite a few years and nearly always looked classy  i have been trying battlestar galactica but after a few episodes that seems like quite a mockery of the genre and grotesquely overrated i feel everything in life has continued to go downhill after the millenium everything was gold in the 80s and 90s  andromeda looks to be a sleeper hit i have on my rader  so what say ye all you star trek stalwarts  what will satisfy my yearning heart ,startrek,television,1455571146.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-2.0,0.0

the plots to ds9 and voyager do nt cross at all they take place in entirely different parts of the galaxy  personally  i would nt recommend watching them simultaneously ds9 was one of the shows that would set the template for the golden age of television the character development and serialization are fantastic i prefer to get immersed in series like that voyager would only suck you out of it  so  i d vote for separately but that s just how i like to watch shows ,startrek,television,1455385884.0,16.0,0.0,62.0,57414.0,1.0

it always seems to be a rule to slow to impulse when you re in a system my guess is in crowded areas with many other ships or gravitational sources  the risk of getting your warp field disrupted is higher it could also be a precision thing stopping on a dime at warp 9 and then being in orbit can be problematic  making sure you do nt run into a planet or a achieve a stable orbit  if we believe the new movies  a warp field can be sustained under the gravitational force of a black hole  and without warp cores   but coming out of warp is coming out blind which could result in you coming out into a debris field ,startrek,television,1455392758.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5542.0,0.0
in a nutshell  impulse power is used for sublight travel and warp is used for ftl speeds as far as i know  impulse power is not capable of achieving any ftl travel the quote from  star trek vi  the undiscovered country  is most likely a writing error  but i m sure explanations have been conceived of  in regards to  best of both worlds    star trek  has always been wildly inconsistent about its use of impulse versus warp power when in a star system dialogue has established multiple times that ships should travel at impulse power when in a star system for safety concerns however  visually  we see ships going to warp all the time when in a star system even worse  kirk and crew jump to warp in the   atmosphere   of earth in  star trek iv  the voyage home  ,startrek,television,1455392426.0,3.0,0.0,661.0,8512.0,0.0
there is no downside beside the shift in quality and style  but i did nt find that to be a problem either when it was initially broadcast or on a recent chronological rewatch there is a small amount of overlap  and voyager s pilot episode involves it being at ds9   but it s fairly minor background elements that wo nt make much of a difference  i prefer the broadcast order because i like those extra bits and you get the same context the production team expected  though you ca nt  really  go wrong with either approach ,startrek,television,1455396219.0,1.0,0.0,2419.0,80021.0,0.0
impulse power is highly inconsistent with measurements like  14 impulse  apparently measuring 14 the maximum output of a given vessel s impulse engines rather than a measurement of speed  14 impulse from a shuttle is very different from 14 impulse from a starship  the star trek voyager technical manual lists full impulse as 14th the speed of light if we assume that the enterprised engines have the same capability  although theirs may be slower or faster   then dropping out of warp around the orbit of neptune would put the ship  45 billion kms from earth  at full impulse  14 the speed of light   wolfram alpha says it d take 60042 seconds  or 1001 minutes  or 1668 hours which is nt too bad dropping out of warp closer to saturn  4725 hours  or jupiter  233 hours  would shave a considerable amount of time off that estimate  of course  tos has scotty saying that the romulan ships use  simple impulse  but still have interstellar capabilities  tl  dr  it s not clear,startrek,television,1455398094.0,2.0,0.0,12255.0,115613.0,1.0

i wonder if those two will grow more together morgan seems to want someone to take under his wing and help understand that there is more to this postapocalyptic life than killing and hate since his opportunity to do so with the wolf ended  i wonder if he will try to push it onto carol ,thewalkingdead,television,1455654030.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,171.0,0.0

i think daryl would be an interesting choice  and really shock twd fans i love the character  but this would be twd biggest character death in some time hes doing another show on amc next year too  seems interesting  i hope abraham lives for awhile  hes become one of my favorite characters  and i agree  i know hes gone before aow  but how can he not stay on the show for that  hes perfect for a war scenario  especially if daryl gets lucille d again it would suck  but i think if twd killed off daryl it would 1  instantly make the majority of twd fans despise negan and 2  would prove twd has got its balls back ,thewalkingdead,television,1455653063.0,6.0,0.0,27.0,65.0,0.0
i think after the wolf leader took denise  morgan realizes he has to dropalter his philosophy that s what they mean by him being  finally back  although lets be honest  i doubt he s gon na have another sudden shift of character i think he ll have internal turmoil with himself gon na be interesting to see how he develops this season ,thewalkingdead,television,1455646578.0,50.0,0.0,174.0,1396.0,0.0

having not read the comics  based on this article i m now predicting   negan is gon na take out either glenn or maggie right away  along with their baby ca nt have two judiths on the show  gt  alternatively  negan could instead straightup kidnap their baby at some point   the one that survives negan s initial encounter will be seriously injured maybe a lost limb or crushed appendage   that one will take negan out in the end on a suicide mission   either daryl or carol will die just get that feeling   if daryl does nt die  he ll be reunited with mr crossbow   if rick and michonne both survive season 6 they ll ship up   if both oneeyed coral and judith survive season 6 i ll be surprised i m impressed they managed to make it this far with a newborn in the first place    edit    neg    e    n not neg    a    n    edit 2    just kidding ,thewalkingdead,television,1455653298.0,11.0,0.0,3867.0,85201.0,0.0

i agree with you and think daryl s death  as much as i do nt want it to happen  would have the greatest impact and setup negan to be this ultimate villain in the eyes of the viewers i ve come to terms with it  but really the only reason why i keep denying it is because he deserves a reunion with his crossbow first ,thewalkingdead,television,1455658275.0,1.0,0.0,1068.0,723.0,0.0

michonne  i think most of us are expecting glenn andor daryl to die soon and i think we re all open to the possibility of the demise of morgan and carol especially abraham  but if there s one character who i never worry about  because i know she wo nt die  is michonne there has nt been a single scene where i ve feared for her life whereas i m on my toes every single time glenn is on the screen  i love her actor but i just do nt feel like the character is justified enough to be given a free pass she s the badass samurai sword woman past that  she has had some development with rick and carl  as well as carrying a new sense of hope she never had in season 3 but i do nt feel this is substantial for immortal status the sword makes the woman  she is  truly  the one death that will actually shock everyone to the core ,thewalkingdead,television,1455634865.0,16.0,0.0,683.0,1189.0,0.0
